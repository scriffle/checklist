      "correct": "The claim has merit because Volvox consists of multiple cells, though it represents a transitional form between unicellular and complex multicellular life",
      "correctExplanation": "Colonial organisms have multiple cells and represent an evolutionary intermediate, supporting partial classification as multicellular.",
