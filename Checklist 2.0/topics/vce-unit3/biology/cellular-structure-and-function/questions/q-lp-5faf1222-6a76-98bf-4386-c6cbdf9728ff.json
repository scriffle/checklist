      "correct": "Cell B is likely specialised for secreting proteins while Cell A primarily produces proteins for internal use",
      "correctExplanation": "Free ribosomes produce proteins that remain in the cell, while ER-attached ribosomes produce proteins for secretion or membrane insertion. The distribution reflects functional specialisation.",

      "question": "Evaluate the following claim: 'Since bacteria lack membrane-bound organelles, they must have a simpler cytosol with fewer functions than eukaryotic cells.' Is this claim valid?",
      "correct": "The claim is partially invalid because bacterial cytosol must perform many functions that are compartmentalised in eukaryotes, making it functionally complex",
      "correctExplanation": "Without organelles, the bacterial cytosol hosts reactions that occur in separate compartments in eukaryotes, making it functionally diverse rather than simpler.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is completely valid because fewer structures means fewer functions", "explanation": "Fewer structures doesn't mean fewer functions; bacterial cytosol performs multiple functions without compartmentalisation." },

      "correct": "Bacterial ribosomes must have structural differences from human ribosomes that allow selective targeting",
      "correctExplanation": "For an antibiotic to affect bacterial but not human cells, the drug must recognise differences in ribosome structure between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Human cells must lack ribosomes entirely", "explanation": "Human cells have ribosomes; they are essential for protein synthesis in all living cells. The antibiotic simply cannot bind to them." },

      "correct": "Both would be lethal, but membrane removal would cause immediate death while ribosome removal would cause gradual decline as existing proteins degrade",
      "correctExplanation": "Membrane loss immediately compromises cell integrity and homeostasis. Without ribosomes, existing proteins still function temporarily, but the cell cannot replace them as they degrade.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Only ribosome removal would be lethal because the plasma membrane is not essential for survival", "explanation": "The plasma membrane is essential; without it, the cell cannot maintain its internal environment and would die rapidly." },

      "correct": "Species A likely lives in colder environments where unsaturated fatty acids maintain membrane fluidity",
      "correctExplanation": "Unsaturated fatty acids prevent tight packing and maintain fluidity at lower temperatures. This adaptation suggests Species A is adapted to colder conditions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Species A must live in warmer environments where membranes need to be more rigid", "explanation": "Unsaturated fatty acids increase fluidity, which is advantageous in cold environments, not warm ones where rigidity might help." },

      "correct": "Drug Y would show immediate effects because it destroys existing functional proteins, while Drug X only prevents new protein synthesis",
      "correctExplanation": "Drug X blocks future production but existing proteins continue functioning until they naturally degrade. Drug Y immediately removes functional proteins, causing rapid disruption.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Drug X would show faster effects because blocking mRNA binding is more severe than protein destruction", "explanation": "Existing proteins would maintain function temporarily with Drug X. Drug Y's immediate protein destruction is faster-acting." },
        { "answer": "Both drugs would show effects at exactly the same rate because they both affect proteins", "explanation": "The timing differs: preventing new synthesis has delayed effects while destroying existing proteins has immediate effects." },
