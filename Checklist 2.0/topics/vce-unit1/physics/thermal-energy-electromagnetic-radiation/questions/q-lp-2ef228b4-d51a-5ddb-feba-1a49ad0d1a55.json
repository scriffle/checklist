      "correct": "Water moderates both heating and cooling, reducing both extremes",

      "correct": "Water stores 25.14 MJ compared to oil's 12 MJ",
      "correctExplanation": "Water: 150 × 4190 × 40 = 25.14 MJ. Oil: 150 × 2000 × 40 = 12 MJ. Water stores about twice as much.",
      "distractors": [
