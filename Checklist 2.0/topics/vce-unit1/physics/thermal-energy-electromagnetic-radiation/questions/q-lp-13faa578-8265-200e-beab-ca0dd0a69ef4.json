      "correct": "The fan speeds up heat distribution by enhancing air circulation throughout the room",
      "correctExplanation": "Forced convection from the fan moves heated air faster than natural convection alone.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The fan has no effect because natural convection is already maximally efficient", "explanation": "Natural convection is slower; fans create forced convection that speeds distribution." },

      "correctExplanation": "Buoyancy lifts the balloon, but the surrounding air pressure and temperature changes limit altitude.",
      "distractors": [
