      "question": "Frost forms on surfaces when water vapour deposits directly as ice. Compare energy released to that of condensation followed by freezing.",
      "correct": "Both processes release the same total energy for equal mass",
      "correctExplanation": "Whether vapour→liquid→solid or vapour→solid directly, total energy released equals Lv + Lf for the same mass.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Direct deposition releases significantly less total energy", "explanation": "The total energy is the same regardless of path; energy is a state function." },

      "correct": "Freezing water releases latent heat, keeping plants warmer",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Ice forms a protective insulating layer around the plants", "explanation": "While ice provides some insulation, the primary protection comes from latent heat release." },

        { "answer": "Evaporating water creates a warming effect on the plants", "explanation": "Evaporation would cool plants; freezing and its heat release provides protection." }

      "question": "A heat pump uses the condensation of a refrigerant to heat a building. Why is this more efficient than direct electric heating?",
      "correct": "Latent heat released during condensation exceeds electrical input",
      "correctExplanation": "The refrigerant absorbs heat from outdoors during evaporation and releases more energy during condensation inside, using electricity only to move heat.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Refrigerant converts electricity directly to thermal energy", "explanation": "Electricity drives the compressor; heat comes primarily from outdoor air via phase changes." },
        { "answer": "Condensation creates new energy not present in the system", "explanation": "Energy is conserved; heat pumps move existing heat, they don't create it." },
        { "answer": "Electric heaters lose most energy as light and sound", "explanation": "Electric heaters are nearly 100% efficient at converting to heat; heat pumps move more heat than they consume." }

      "correct": "Sweat evaporates absorbing heat; rain is already liquid",
      "correctExplanation": "Evaporation of sweat absorbs 2,256 kJ/kg from skin. Rain is already liquid, so no phase change occurs to absorb latent heat.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Rain is warmer than sweat so transfers less heat", "explanation": "Temperature difference isn't the key factor; the phase change in sweat evaporation is crucial." },
        { "answer": "Sweat contains salt which increases evaporation energy", "explanation": "While salt slightly affects evaporation, the main cooling is from the latent heat absorption." },
        { "answer": "Rain runs off while sweat stays on skin longer", "explanation": "Contact time matters, but the fundamental difference is evaporation versus no phase change." }
