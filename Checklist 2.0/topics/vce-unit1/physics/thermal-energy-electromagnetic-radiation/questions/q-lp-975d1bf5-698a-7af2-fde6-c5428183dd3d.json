      "correct": "This is incorrect; the final temperature depends on the masses and specific heat capacities of both",
      "correctExplanation": "Thermal equilibrium temperature is determined by conservation of energy, which depends on mass and specific heat capacity, not just initial temperatures.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This is correct; thermal equilibrium always occurs at the midpoint between temperatures", "explanation": "The midpoint assumption ignores that different materials and masses affect the final equilibrium temperature." },

      "question": "Analyze why hot sparks from a sparkler do not burn your skin despite being at temperatures over 1000°C.",
      "correct": "The sparks have very low mass and therefore contain little total thermal energy",
      "correctExplanation": "Despite high temperature, the tiny mass means minimal total thermal energy transfers to your skin before cooling.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The sparks are not actually hot; the glow is just reflected light from the sparkler", "explanation": "Sparks are genuinely hot glowing metal particles, not reflected light; their temperature is real." },
        { "answer": "Your skin rapidly cools the sparks before any thermal energy can possibly transfer", "explanation": "Your skin does absorb the spark's energy, but the spark has so little energy that it does not cause burns." },
        { "answer": "Air molecules surrounding the sparks absorb all the thermal energy before contact", "explanation": "Sparks do contact skin; it is their low mass and energy content that prevents burns, not air absorption." }

      "correct": "The frozen lake contains more thermal energy due to its enormously greater mass",
      "correctExplanation": "Thermal energy is proportional to mass times temperature; the lake's huge mass outweighs the tea's higher temperature.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The hot tea contains more thermal energy because it is at a much higher temperature", "explanation": "Temperature alone does not determine total thermal energy; the lake's mass is billions of times greater." },
        { "answer": "Both contain equal thermal energy because energy is conserved in all closed systems", "explanation": "Conservation of energy does not mean all objects have equal energy; it means total energy is constant in isolated systems." },

      "correctExplanation": "Objects with the same temperature can lose different amounts of energy depending on their mass and material properties.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This approach is correct because temperature directly measures how much energy an object contains", "explanation": "Temperature measures average kinetic energy per particle, not total energy content." },
        { "answer": "This approach is correct because higher temperature always means greater thermal energy content", "explanation": "A small hot object can have less total thermal energy than a large warm object." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The hotter object will continue heating indefinitely because it started with more energy", "explanation": "Without external energy input, the hot object cannot continue heating; it will cool toward equilibrium." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This claim is correct; energy is used up during the phase change of ice to liquid water", "explanation": "Energy is not used up; it is stored as potential energy in the weaker intermolecular bonds of liquid water." },

      "correct": "In both cases, your breath is closer to body temperature than the soup or cold hands are to ambient air",
      "correctExplanation": "Your breath at about 37°C is cooler than hot soup but warmer than cold hands, so it moderates both toward body temperature.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Blowing creates friction that heats cold objects and cools hot objects equally through air motion", "explanation": "Friction is not the mechanism; temperature difference between breath and object determines warming or cooling." },
        { "answer": "The moisture in your breath absorbs heat from soup but releases heat onto your cold hands", "explanation": "While moisture plays a role, the primary factor is the temperature of breath relative to the object." },

      "correct": "This is correct; the ice needs additional latent heat of fusion to melt before it can be heated to 100°C",
      "correctExplanation": "Ice must first absorb 334 kJ/kg to melt at 0°C, then additional energy to heat the water to 100°C.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This is incorrect; both require the same energy because they have the same mass and end temperature", "explanation": "Starting as ice requires the extra latent heat of fusion that starting as water does not require." },
