      "correct": "Not all ice will melt; some remains frozen",
      "correctExplanation": "Since less energy is available than needed to melt all ice, some ice remains at thermal equilibrium.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "All ice melts and reaches above 0°C", "explanation": "Insufficient energy means not all ice melts; temperature cannot rise." },
        { "answer": "The latent heat value must be incorrect", "explanation": "The calculation shows energy limitation, not incorrect values." },
        { "answer": "Energy was lost to the surroundings only", "explanation": "Even accounting for losses, the key issue is insufficient energy for complete melting." }

      "question": "Compare the cooling effect of 50 g of ice at 0°C versus 50 g of ice at -20°C added to a drink. Which statement is correct?",
      "correct": "Ice at -20°C absorbs slightly more total energy",
      "correctExplanation": "The colder ice absorbs extra energy (Q = mcΔT) to warm from -20°C to 0°C before melting.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both absorb exactly the same amount of energy", "explanation": "The -20°C ice absorbs additional energy warming to 0°C before melting." },
        { "answer": "Ice at 0°C absorbs significantly more energy", "explanation": "Both have the same latent heat; the colder ice absorbs additional sensible heat." },

      "correct": "Incorrect reasoning; steam releases latent heat when condensing",
      "correctExplanation": "Both are at 100°C initially. Steam releases 2260 kJ/kg when condensing, then more as it cools.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Correct; steam is always hotter than boiling water", "explanation": "Both can be at 100°C; the difference is in latent heat release." },
        { "answer": "Incorrect; water conducts heat better than steam", "explanation": "While conduction differs, the main factor is latent heat release." },
        { "answer": "Correct; steam molecules move faster than water molecules", "explanation": "At the same temperature, average kinetic energies are similar; latent heat is key." }

      "correct": "The system was not perfectly insulated",
      "correctExplanation": "Calculate: Energy from water = 0.2 × 4190 × 40 = 33,520 J. Ice needs 33,400 J to melt + more to reach 40°C. Energy doesn't balance.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The specific heat capacity of water is higher than expected", "explanation": "The imbalance suggests heat loss, not incorrect specific heat values." },
        { "answer": "Some water evaporated during the experiment unexpectedly", "explanation": "Evaporation at 40°C is minimal; insulation loss is more significant." },

      "correctExplanation": "When ice melts, Q = mL must be added to account for the phase change energy.",

        { "answer": "Student A; latent heat only applies to boiling", "explanation": "Latent heat applies to all phase changes, including melting." },
        { "answer": "Both are correct depending on final temperature", "explanation": "If ice melts at all, latent heat must always be included." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The calculation was done incorrectly by the student", "explanation": "0°C equilibrium is a valid physical result, not necessarily an error." },
        { "answer": "Water always freezes when mixed with ice at 0°C", "explanation": "Warm water doesn't freeze; it may not have enough energy to melt all ice." },

      "correctExplanation": "Ice absorbs latent heat (334 kJ/kg) plus sensible heat, making it more effective per unit mass.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Water bath cools faster due to higher heat capacity", "explanation": "Speed and capacity differ; ice absorbs more total energy per kg." },
        { "answer": "Both absorb identical energy for the same temperature drop", "explanation": "Ice absorbs additional latent heat that water at 0°C does not." },
        { "answer": "Ice bath is less effective because ice is a solid", "explanation": "Despite being solid, ice absorbs latent heat which increases its cooling capacity." }

      "correct": "A phase change released additional energy near 100°C",
      "correctExplanation": "Higher than expected temperature suggests extra energy release, possibly from condensation.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The specific heat capacities must differ from tables", "explanation": "Different capacities would explain asymmetric mixing, but 60°C specifically suggests phase change." },
