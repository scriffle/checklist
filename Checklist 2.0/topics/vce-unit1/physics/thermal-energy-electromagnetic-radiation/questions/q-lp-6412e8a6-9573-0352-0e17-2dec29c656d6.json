      "correct": "Ocean water absorbs and releases large amounts of energy with small temperature changes",
      "correctExplanation": "Water's high specific heat capacity means oceans act as thermal buffers, moderating temperature extremes.",

      "correct": "The claim is incorrect; water stores more energy per kg per degree",
      "correctExplanation": "Higher specific heat capacity means water stores more thermal energy for the same mass and temperature change, making it better for thermal storage.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct; faster heating means better storage", "explanation": "Faster heating indicates lower energy storage per degree, not better storage capacity." },

      "correct": "2.5 : 1",
      "correctExplanation": "Since c = Q/(mΔT) and mass and Q are equal: cₓ/cᵧ = ΔTᵧ/ΔTₓ = 25/10 = 2.5, so cₓ : cᵧ = 2.5 : 1.",
      "distractors": [

      "correctExplanation": "A drops 20 K, B rises 40 K. Energy: mAcA(20) = mBcB(40). Since masses are equal: cB/cA = 20/40 × (mA/mB) = 0.5, so cA/cB = 0.5, meaning cB = 2cA.",

      "correct": "The specific heat capacity may vary with temperature",
      "correctExplanation": "First: c = 20,000/(0.5 × 20) = 2000. Second: c = 25,000/(0.5 × 25) = 2000. The values match, but if they differed, it would indicate temperature dependence.",
