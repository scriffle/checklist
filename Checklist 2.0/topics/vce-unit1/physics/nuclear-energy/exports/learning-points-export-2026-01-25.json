      "what": "Nuclear energy is released when a small amount of mass is converted into energy according to Einstein's equation E = mc². Both fission and fusion reactions involve this mass-to-energy conversion.",
      "why": "This principle explains why nuclear fuels contain so much more energy per kilogram than chemical fuels, and forms the basis for understanding all nuclear technologies.",
      "example": "When uranium-235 undergoes fission, about 0.1% of its mass is converted to energy. If 1.0 kg of uranium-235 completely fissions, 1.0 g of mass becomes 9.0 × 10¹³ J of energy.",

      "why": "Being able to calculate energy from mass difference allows you to quantify the enormous energy released in nuclear reactions and compare nuclear to chemical energy sources.",
      "example": "A nuclear bomb converts 0.7 g of mass to energy: E = (7 × 10⁻⁴)(9 × 10¹⁶) = 63 × 10¹² J = 63 TJ, equivalent to about 15 kilotonnes of TNT.",

      "why": "This comparison explains why a small uranium pellet can release as much energy as burning a tonne of coal, making nuclear energy so concentrated.",
      "example": "Burning 1.0 kg of coal releases 3.0 × 10⁷ J with a mass loss of 0.33 μg. Fissioning 1.0 kg of uranium-235 releases 9.0 × 10¹³ J with a mass loss of 1.0 g, about 3 million times more energy.",

      "why": "Understanding this distinction clarifies why nuclear fuels are so much more energy-dense and why nuclear reactions fundamentally differ from ordinary combustion.",

      "why": "This process is the basis for nuclear reactors and weapons. The released neutrons can trigger further fissions, potentially creating a chain reaction.",
      "example": "When U-235 absorbs a neutron, it briefly becomes U-236, then splits into barium-141 and krypton-92, releasing 3 neutrons and about 200 MeV of energy.",

      "what": "Fissile materials can sustain a chain reaction when bombarded with neutrons. Uranium-235 and plutonium-239 are fissile. Uranium-238 is non-fissile as it does not readily undergo fission.",
      "why": "Knowing which materials are fissile is essential for understanding why uranium must be enriched and why plutonium can be produced in reactors.",
      "example": "Natural uranium is 99.3% non-fissile U-238 and only 0.7% fissile U-235. Reactor fuel is typically enriched to 3.5-4.5% U-235, while weapons require over 90% U-235.",

      "what": "A chain reaction occurs when neutrons released by one fission event cause further fissions in nearby nuclei, which release more neutrons, causing even more fissions in a self-sustaining process.",
      "why": "Chain reactions are the key to both controlled nuclear power and uncontrolled nuclear explosions. Understanding them is crucial for nuclear safety.",
      "example": "If each fission releases 2.5 neutrons on average and 2 of these cause new fissions, the number of fissions doubles each generation. After 80 generations, an enormous explosion occurs.",

      "what": "In a controlled chain reaction, exactly one neutron per fission causes another fission, maintaining steady power output. In an uncontrolled reaction, multiple neutrons cause multiple fissions, growing exponentially.",
      "why": "Nuclear reactors require controlled reactions for safe, sustained power generation. Nuclear weapons rely on uncontrolled reactions for explosive energy release.",
      "example": "In a power reactor, control rods absorb excess neutrons so only 1 of 2.5 neutrons causes another fission. In a bomb, all neutrons are allowed to cause fissions, leading to exponential growth.",

      "what": "In nuclear equations, the total number of protons (atomic number) and total number of nucleons (mass number) must be conserved on both sides of the equation.",
      "why": "Balancing nuclear equations allows you to identify unknown products and verify that proposed reactions obey conservation laws.",
      "example": "For ²³⁵U + ¹n → ¹⁴⁰Xe + ⁹⁴Sr + ?n: Nucleons: 235+1 = 140+94+?, so ? = 2 neutrons. Protons: 92+0 = 54+38+0, which balances.",

      "code": "3.1",
      "what": "Critical mass is the minimum amount of fissile material needed to sustain a chain reaction, where the rate of neutron creation by fission equals the rate of neutron loss through the surface.",
      "why": "Understanding critical mass explains why small amounts of fissile material are safe to handle but larger amounts can become dangerous, and why bomb design involves assembling subcritical masses.",
      "example": "A small sphere of U-235 is subcritical because too many neutrons escape through the surface. A larger sphere has less surface area relative to volume, so more neutrons stay inside to cause fissions.",

      "code": "3.2",
      "what": "Criticality depends on the ratio of volume to surface area. A sphere has the smallest surface area for a given volume, so spheres reach criticality with less mass. Flat shapes lose more neutrons and are safer.",
      "why": "This principle explains why nuclear weapons use spherical shapes and why reactor fuel is arranged in thin rods rather than large lumps.",
      "example": "A sphere of U-235 may be critical, but the same mass spread into a thin flat sheet is subcritical because neutrons escape easily through the large surface area.",

      "why": "Without moderators, most neutrons would be too fast to cause fissions efficiently, and the chain reaction could not be sustained in reactor fuel.",
      "example": "Water, graphite, and heavy water are common moderators. When a fast neutron collides with hydrogen in water, it loses energy like a billiard ball hitting another ball of similar mass.",

      "why": "Understanding stellar fusion explains where sunlight comes from and demonstrates the enormous scale of energy that fusion can produce.",
      "example": "In the proton-proton chain, hydrogen fuses through several steps: H-1 + H-1 → H-2, then H-2 + H-1 → He-3, finally He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2H-1.",

      "example": "A helium-4 nucleus has mass 4.0026 u, but two protons and two neutrons separately have mass 4.0319 u. The mass defect of 0.0293 u corresponds to a binding energy of 28.3 MeV.",
