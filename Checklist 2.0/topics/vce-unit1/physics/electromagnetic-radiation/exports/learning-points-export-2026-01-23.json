      "why": "These four quantities are the building blocks for describing any wave. Without them, we cannot quantify or compare different waves.",
      "example": "A water wave has crests 4.0 m apart (wavelength = 4.0 m), reaches 0.5 m above the calm water level (amplitude = 0.5 m), and 2 complete waves pass a pier every second (frequency = 2 Hz, period = 0.5 s).",

      "example": "A wave has a frequency of 3.0 × 10⁹ Hz and a speed of 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s. Using λ = v/f: λ = (3.0 × 10⁸)/(3.0 × 10⁹) = 0.10 m or 10 cm.",

      "why": "Some wave measurements provide period rather than frequency, such as timing ocean waves or heartbeats. This form of the equation allows direct calculation without first converting to frequency.",
      "example": "A wave travels at 16 km/s with a period of 0.40 s. Using λ = vT: λ = 16,000 × 0.40 = 6,400 m or 6.4 km.",

      "why": "This concept explains why light changes wavelength (and colour perception) in different materials, and why the same radio station has different wavelengths in air versus water.",
      "example": "A 500 Hz sound wave travels at 340 m/s in air (λ = 0.68 m) but at 1500 m/s in water. Since frequency stays at 500 Hz, the wavelength in water becomes λ = 1500/500 = 3.0 m.",

      "why": "This distinction affects how waves interact with barriers and openings. Transverse waves can be polarised (vibrations restricted to one plane), while longitudinal waves cannot.",
      "example": "Shaking a slinky spring up and down creates a transverse wave where coils move vertically while the wave travels horizontally. Pushing and pulling the slinky along its length creates a longitudinal wave with compressions (bunched coils) and rarefactions (stretched coils).",

      "why": "This explains why we can see the Sun but cannot hear explosions in space. Understanding this distinction is crucial for space communication and astronomy.",

      "why": "This principle explains why a cork bobs up and down on water waves but does not travel with the wave, and why sound can carry energy to your ear without wind blowing towards you.",
      "example": "In a stadium Mexican wave, each person stands and sits in sequence, but no person moves along the stadium. Similarly, water waves carry energy across the ocean while individual water molecules mostly move up and down in place.",

      "why": "Engineers must carefully select core and cladding materials to achieve the desired critical angle. Too small a difference makes the fibre very sensitive to bending; too large reduces the number of paths light can take.",
      "example": "If a fibre needs θc = 82°, and the core has n = 1.66, then the cladding must have n = 1.66 × sin(82°) = 1.64. This small difference (0.02) still allows total internal reflection at steep angles.",
