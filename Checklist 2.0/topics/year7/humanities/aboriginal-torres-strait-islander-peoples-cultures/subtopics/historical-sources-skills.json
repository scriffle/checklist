  "what": "This subtopic focuses on the skills needed to study history, including understanding different types of sources, sequencing chronology, and using evidence to support arguments.",
  "why": "Developing historical skills helps us analyse and interpret evidence about the past, allowing us to build accurate understandings of how ancient societies lived.",

      "title": "I can explain what sequencing chronology means and why it is important",
      "code": "6.1",
      "what": "Sequencing chronology means putting events into the order they happened. Historians use this skill to see patterns and links between events over both large timespans (like 60,000 years) and smaller ones (like 5-10 years).",
      "why": "Without a clear chronology, it is easy to get confused about what is happening and how events and people are connected to each other.",
      "example": "A timeline of ancient Australia might show: earliest evidence of human occupation (65,000 BCE), Mungo Lady and Mungo Man (40,000 BCE), peak of Ice Age (20,000 BCE), Tasmania cut off from mainland (11,000 BCE), and the great flood ending (3,000 BCE).",

      "title": "I can distinguish between primary and secondary historical sources",
      "code": "6.2",
      "what": "Primary sources are original materials from the time period being studied, such as artefacts, rock art and oral histories. Secondary sources are interpretations of the past created later, such as history books and documentaries.",
      "why": "Understanding the difference between source types helps us evaluate how reliable information is and how it should be used as evidence.",
      "example": "A 30,000-year-old grindstone is a primary source showing how Aboriginal peoples made flour. Bruce Pascoe's book Dark Emu is a secondary source that interprets evidence about ancient agricultural practices.",

      "title": "I can use evidence from historical sources to support an argument",
      "code": "6.3",
      "what": "Historians use evidence such as dates, statistics, examples and quotes from sources to support their arguments about the past. Claims need to be backed up with specific evidence.",
      "why": "Using evidence makes historical arguments more convincing and helps distinguish between opinions and well-supported conclusions.",
      "example": "To argue that Aboriginal peoples were skilled farmers, you could cite the 30,000-year-old grindstones, the 6,000-year-old Budj Bim aquaculture system, and early European explorers' accounts of seeing grain fields and mills.",

      "title": "I can explain what BCE and CE mean in historical dating",
      "code": "6.4",
      "what": "BCE stands for 'Before the Common Era' and CE stands for 'Common Era'. These are used instead of BC (Before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini) to provide a more neutral dating system.",
      "why": "Understanding dating conventions helps us accurately place events in time and communicate clearly about when things happened in history.",
      "example": "The peak of the Ice Age was around 20,000 BCE. Lieutenant James Cook arrived in Australia in 1770 CE. The great flood ended around 3,000 BCE.",

      "title": "I can analyse historical sources by considering their origin and purpose",
      "code": "6.5",
      "what": "When analysing a source, historians consider who created it, when it was created, and why. This helps determine how reliable and useful the source is for understanding the past.",
      "why": "The creator's perspective and purpose can affect how events are portrayed, so understanding these factors helps us interpret sources more accurately.",
      "example": "Joseph Lycett's 1817 painting 'Aborigines using fire to hunt kangaroos' was created by an English convict artist. His European perspective may have influenced how he depicted Aboriginal practices, so we should consider this when using the painting as evidence.",
