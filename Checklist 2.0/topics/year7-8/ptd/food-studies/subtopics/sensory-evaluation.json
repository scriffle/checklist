  "what": "This subtopic covers how we perceive food through our senses, including the five basic tastes, the multi-sensory eating experience, texture vocabulary, and formal sensory evaluation methods used in food science.",
  "why": "Understanding sensory evaluation helps you describe food more precisely, understand why certain flavour combinations work, and conduct fair tests to compare food products objectively.",

      "title": "I can identify and describe the five basic taste sensations",
      "code": "5.1",
      "what": "The five basic tastes are sweet (sugars), sour (acids), salty (sodium chloride), bitter (various compounds), and umami (glutamate). Each taste serves an evolutionary purpose in identifying nutritious or dangerous foods.",
      "why": "Understanding the five tastes helps you analyse flavours in food and understand how different tastes interact and balance each other.",
      "example": "Umami (meaning deliciousness in Japanese) is found in Parmesan cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms, and Vegemite. It was identified by Dr Kikunae Ikeda in 1908 and signals protein-rich foods.",

      "title": "I can explain why the tongue map is a myth",
      "code": "5.2",
      "what": "The tongue map showing different areas tasting different things is scientifically incorrect. Taste receptors for all five tastes are distributed across the entire tongue - you can taste any taste anywhere on your tongue.",
      "why": "Understanding this corrects a common misconception and reflects accurate scientific knowledge about how taste perception works.",
      "example": "If you place salt on the very tip of your tongue, you will taste it immediately - proving that saltiness is not restricted to the sides of the tongue as the myth suggests.",

      "title": "I can explain how tastes interact with each other",
      "code": "5.3",
      "what": "Tastes interact in predictable ways: salt enhances sweetness and reduces bitterness; sweet and sour balance each other; umami can reduce the need for salt; sweet masks bitterness.",
      "why": "Understanding taste interactions helps cooks balance flavours in dishes and explains why certain flavour combinations are popular.",
      "example": "Salted caramel works because salt enhances the perception of sweetness. Adding Parmesan (umami) to pasta means you need less salt because umami provides satisfying savoury depth.",

      "title": "I can explain the role of smell in flavour perception",
      "code": "5.4",
      "what": "Approximately 80% of what we perceive as taste actually comes from smell. Aromas reach our smell receptors through orthonasal (through nostrils) and retronasal (from mouth to nose while eating) pathways.",
      "why": "Understanding the importance of smell explains why food tastes bland when you have a cold and why aroma is crucial to the eating experience.",
      "example": "When you have a blocked nose from a cold, food seems flavourless because you cannot smell it. The complex flavours of coffee or wine come largely from hundreds of volatile aroma compounds.",

      "title": "I can use appropriate vocabulary to describe food texture",
      "code": "5.5",
      "what": "Texture descriptors include: crispy (light, shatters easily), crunchy (firm, requires force), chewy (requires prolonged chewing), tender (easy to bite), tough (difficult to chew), smooth, creamy, flaky, crumbly, moist, dry, and juicy.",
      "why": "Precise texture vocabulary allows you to communicate about food effectively and is essential for sensory evaluation and recipe development.",
      "example": "A potato chip is crispy (light, shatters with a high-pitched sound), while a raw carrot is crunchy (firm, requires force to bite through with a cracking sound). These are different textures despite both being snappy.",

      "code": "5.6",
      "what": "In a triangle test, tasters receive three samples (two identical, one different) labelled with random 3-digit codes. They must identify the odd one out. The chance of guessing correctly is 33%.",
      "why": "Triangle tests determine if people can detect differences between products, which is useful when testing recipe changes or comparing similar products objectively.",
      "example": "To test if consumers notice reduced salt in a recipe, serve three coded samples (two original, one reduced salt) to multiple tasters. If significantly more than 33% identify the odd one out, there is a detectable difference.",

      "title": "I can explain how to eliminate bias in sensory testing",
      "code": "5.7",
      "what": "Fair sensory tests require: blind testing with random codes (not names); randomised presentation order; no talking between tasters; same temperature, quantity, and containers; palate cleansers between samples; immediate recording of results.",
      "why": "Bias can significantly affect results. Knowing a sample is new recipe versus old recipe, or discussing with others, can influence perception and make results unreliable.",
      "example": "Labelling samples Sample A and Sample B creates bias because people may assume A is better. Using random 3-digit codes like 472, 815, and 293 eliminates this bias.",
