      "what": "The five food groups are: vegetables and legumes/beans; fruit; grain (cereal) foods; lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts, seeds and legumes; and milk, yoghurt, cheese and alternatives.",
      "why": "Each food group provides different essential nutrients. Eating from all five groups ensures your body gets the variety of vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates and fats it needs.",
      "example": "Legumes like chickpeas and lentils belong to two food groups - they count as both a vegetable AND a protein source because they provide nutrients from both groups.",

      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "A standard serve is a specific quantity that allows consistent measurement across food types. Serve sizes vary between food groups based on their nutrient and energy content.",
      "why": "Knowing serve sizes helps you track whether you are meeting recommended daily intakes and allows you to plan balanced meals accurately.",
      "example": "One serve of protein foods is 65g cooked lean red meat (about palm size), 2 large eggs, or 1 cup cooked legumes. One serve of dairy is 1 cup (250ml) milk or 2 slices (40g) of hard cheese.",

      "what": "The Australian Dietary Guidelines specify how many serves from each food group adolescents need daily, which varies slightly by age and sex.",
      "why": "Adolescents have higher nutritional needs due to rapid growth and development. Meeting these recommendations supports healthy bone development, brain function, and energy levels.",
      "example": "A 13-year-old girl needs 5 serves of vegetables, 2 serves of fruit, 5 serves of grains, 2.5 serves of protein foods, and 3.5 serves of dairy daily, plus 1.4-1.6 litres of water.",

      "code": "1.4",
      "what": "Discretionary foods are high in energy (kilojoules) but low in beneficial nutrients. They are high in saturated fat, added sugars, or salt and are not part of the five food groups.",
      "why": "Consuming too many discretionary foods can lead to weight gain and health problems while displacing more nutritious options from your diet.",
      "example": "One serve of discretionary food (600kJ) equals about 2 scoops of ice cream, one-third of a meat pie, or 1 small packet of chips (30g). The guidelines recommend limiting these to a maximum of one serve per day.",

      "title": "I can explain the concept of nutrient density and compare foods using this concept",
      "code": "1.5",
      "what": "Nutrient density measures how many beneficial nutrients a food provides relative to its energy (kilojoule) content. High nutrient-dense foods provide lots of vitamins, minerals, and fibre for relatively few kilojoules.",
      "why": "Choosing nutrient-dense foods helps you meet your nutritional needs without consuming excess energy, supporting healthy weight and overall wellbeing.",
      "example": "An apple (350kJ) provides fibre, vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants. A handful of pretzels (350kJ) provides mostly refined carbohydrates. Both have similar energy, but the apple is much more nutrient-dense.",

      "title": "I can explain why whole fruit is preferable to fruit juice",
      "code": "1.6",
      "what": "When fruit is juiced, the fibre is removed and the natural sugars become more concentrated. Whole fruit takes longer to eat and provides greater satiety.",
      "why": "Fibre is essential for digestive health and helps slow the absorption of sugars into the bloodstream. Removing fibre means you consume sugar more quickly and feel less full.",
      "example": "A glass of orange juice contains the sugar from 3-4 oranges but none of the fibre. Eating one whole orange gives you the same vitamins plus 2-3g of fibre and takes longer to consume.",

      "title": "I can explain the difference between protein denaturation and coagulation",
      "code": "2.1",
      "what": "Denaturation is when a protein's folded structure unravels due to heat, acid, or mechanical action. Coagulation is when denatured proteins bond together to form a solid or semi-solid mass.",
      "why": "These processes explain why eggs solidify when cooked, why meat changes texture, and why overcooked proteins become tough and dry.",
      "example": "When you cook an egg white, denaturation causes the proteins to unravel, then coagulation bonds them together into a firm white mass that traps water. This change is permanent - you cannot uncook an egg.",

      "what": "Egg white coagulates at 62-65°C, while egg yolk coagulates at a slightly higher temperature of 65-70°C.",
      "why": "Knowing these temperatures explains why you can cook a fried egg with a firm white but runny yolk - the white sets at a lower temperature than the yolk.",
      "example": "A soft-boiled egg cooked for 6 minutes has a fully set white but a jammy yolk because the centre has reached 65-70°C but not been held there long enough to fully coagulate.",

      "code": "2.3",
      "what": "Collagen is tough connective tissue found in cheaper meat cuts. When heated slowly at 70-82°C for 2-4 hours, collagen transforms into soft, silky gelatin.",
      "why": "This explains why tough cuts like brisket and lamb shanks become tender with slow cooking, while the same cuts would be chewy if grilled quickly.",
      "example": "Beef brisket contains lots of collagen. Grilling it quickly would result in tough, chewy meat. Braising it at 150°C for 3 hours converts the collagen to gelatin, making it fall-apart tender.",

      "title": "I can describe the process of starch gelatinisation",
      "code": "2.4",
      "what": "Gelatinisation occurs when starch granules are heated in liquid. Around 60°C they absorb water and swell; at 96°C they burst, releasing starch molecules that thicken the liquid.",
      "why": "Understanding gelatinisation helps you make smooth sauces, understand why stirring prevents lumps, and know when a sauce has reached its maximum thickness.",
      "example": "When making a white sauce, you heat flour in milk while stirring constantly. At 96°C, the starch granules burst and release their starch, thickening the sauce. If you add all the milk at once without stirring, the granules clump together creating lumps.",

      "what": "Staling is caused by retrogradation - when gelatinised starch molecules slowly reorganise and recrystallise, pushing water out. This process happens fastest at refrigerator temperatures (around 4°C).",
      "why": "Understanding retrogradation helps you store bread correctly and explains why toasting can temporarily refresh stale bread by reversing the process.",
      "example": "Bread stored in the fridge will go stale in 1-2 days, while bread at room temperature takes 3-4 days. For longer storage, freezing is best because it essentially stops retrogradation.",

      "what": "The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that occurs above 140°C in dry conditions. It creates brown colour, complex flavours, and appealing aromas.",
      "why": "The Maillard reaction is responsible for the delicious flavours in toast, seared meat, roasted coffee, and baked goods. Understanding it helps you achieve better browning in cooking.",
      "example": "Boiled potatoes are pale because the water limits temperature to 100°C. Roasted potatoes turn golden brown because the dry oven heat reaches 200°C, allowing the Maillard reaction to occur.",

      "code": "6.2",
      "what": "Ultra-processed foods typically have: long ingredient lists (5+ ingredients), ingredients not used in home cooking (high-fructose corn syrup, protein isolates), and cosmetic additives (colours, emulsifiers, thickeners).",
      "why": "Being able to identify ultra-processed foods from their labels helps you make informed choices about what to eat.",
      "example": "A packaged snack listing wheat flour, sugar, glucose syrup, hydrogenated vegetable oil, maltodextrin, colour (102), flavour, and emulsifier (471) is ultra-processed - it contains multiple ingredients you would not use at home.",

      "title": "I can explain why food miles alone are not always a good indicator of environmental impact",
      "code": "6.3",
      "what": "How food is produced often matters more than how far it travels. Heated greenhouses, intensive farming, and production methods can generate more emissions than transport, even for local foods.",
      "why": "Understanding this complexity helps you make more informed choices about sustainable eating rather than relying on simple assumptions.",
      "example": "New Zealand lamb exported to the UK produces about four times less carbon emissions than UK-raised lamb because New Zealand's climate allows grass-fed farming with minimal inputs. Ending all international food transport would only reduce food system emissions by about 9%.",

      "code": "6.4",
      "what": "Foods have vastly different environmental impacts. Beef produces 36-100 kg CO2 per kg, while vegetables produce under 1 kg CO2 per kg. Beef also requires 15,415 litres of water per kg compared to 322 litres for vegetables.",
      "why": "Understanding these differences helps you make food choices that reduce your environmental impact.",
      "example": "Beef produces about 6 times more greenhouse gases than chicken per 50g of protein, and up to 100 times more than legumes. Eating more plants and less red meat is one of the most effective ways to reduce your food footprint.",

      "code": "6.5",
      "what": "Australia wastes 7.6 million tonnes of food per year (312 kg per person). About 70% could have been eaten. Households are the biggest source at 32%. Food waste in landfill releases methane, which is 28 times more potent than CO2.",
      "why": "Understanding food waste helps you see why reducing it matters for both your budget and the environment.",
      "example": "The average Australian household wastes $2,500-$3,800 worth of food per year. The most commonly wasted foods are vegetables (29%), fruit (22%), and bakery items (21%). Understanding date labels alone could significantly reduce this waste.",

      "code": "6.6",
      "what": "Convenience foods save time and require minimal preparation, but are often higher in salt, sugar, and saturated fat, have more packaging, and are usually more expensive than home-prepared equivalents.",
      "why": "Understanding trade-offs helps you make balanced decisions about when convenience foods are appropriate and which options are healthier.",
      "example": "Frozen vegetables and canned legumes are healthy convenience options - nutrients are preserved by flash-freezing, and canned legumes just need rinsing. Mass-produced frozen meals often contain high sodium and multiple additives.",

      "why": "Reducing food waste saves money and reduces environmental impact. Many strategies are simple habits that become automatic with practice.",
      "example": "A can of beans two months past its best-before date is still safe to eat if undamaged. Understanding this distinction between use-by (safety) and best-before (quality) could prevent unnecessary waste of pantry items.",
