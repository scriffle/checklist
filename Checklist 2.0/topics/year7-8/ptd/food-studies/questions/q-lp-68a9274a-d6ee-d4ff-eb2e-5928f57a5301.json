    {"type":"mc","question":"Which of the following foods is considered delicate?","correct":"Fish fillet","correctExplanation":"Fish has delicate proteins that denature at low temperatures and a fragile structure that can break apart with aggressive cooking.","distractors":[{"answer":"Beef brisket","explanation":"Beef brisket is a tough cut with lots of collagen, not a delicate food."},{"answer":"Lamb shank","explanation":"Lamb shanks are tough cuts requiring slow cooking, not delicate."},{"answer":"Pork shoulder","explanation":"Pork shoulder is a tough cut with connective tissue, not delicate."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"At what temperature range does egg white coagulate?","correct":"62-65°C","correctExplanation":"Egg white proteins begin coagulating at 62-65°C, which is relatively low, making eggs a delicate food.","distractors":[{"answer":"85-95°C","explanation":"This is the simmering range; egg whites coagulate at the lower temperature of 62-65°C."},{"answer":"100°C","explanation":"100°C is the boiling point; egg whites coagulate at the much lower temperature of 62-65°C."},{"answer":"40-50°C","explanation":"40-50°C is too low for egg white coagulation to occur."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Which cooking method is most suitable for delicate foods?","correct":"Poaching","correctExplanation":"Poaching at 70-80°C uses the gentlest heat without turbulence, making it ideal for delicate foods like fish and eggs.","distractors":[{"answer":"Deep frying","explanation":"Deep frying uses very high heat (170-190°C) that is too aggressive for delicate foods."},{"answer":"Grilling","explanation":"Grilling uses direct high heat that can dry out and damage delicate foods."},{"answer":"Boiling","explanation":"Boiling at 100°C creates turbulence that can break apart delicate foods."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What happens when eggs are overcooked?","correct":"They become tough and rubbery","correctExplanation":"Overcooking causes egg proteins to coagulate too tightly, squeezing out moisture and creating a tough, rubbery texture.","distractors":[{"answer":"They become soft and creamy","explanation":"Soft and creamy eggs result from gentle cooking, not overcooking."},{"answer":"They dissolve into liquid","explanation":"Eggs solidify when cooked; they don't dissolve."},{"answer":"They turn green throughout","explanation":"A green ring may form around overcooked yolks, but the egg doesn't turn entirely green."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How can you tell when fish is properly cooked?","correct":"It flakes easily with a fork","correctExplanation":"Properly cooked fish separates into flakes when gently pressed with a fork, indicating the proteins have coagulated but not been overcooked.","distractors":[{"answer":"It turns completely black on the outside","explanation":"Blackened fish indicates burning or charring, not proper cooking."},{"answer":"It becomes hard and rigid throughout","explanation":"Hard, rigid fish is overcooked; properly cooked fish should be flaky and moist."},{"answer":"It stays translucent and wobbly in the centre","explanation":"Translucent, wobbly centres indicate the fish is still raw or undercooked."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Poaching is the gentlest wet cooking method because it uses temperatures of 70-80°C.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"Poaching uses the lowest temperatures of the wet cooking methods (70-80°C), with no visible bubbles, making it the gentlest option for delicate foods.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Students may think simmering is gentler, but poaching uses lower temperatures (70-80°C vs 85-95°C)."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Fish proteins denature at higher temperatures than meat proteins.","correct":"False","correctExplanation":"Fish proteins are more delicate and denature at lower temperatures than meat proteins, which is why fish requires gentler cooking methods.","distractors":[{"answer":"True","explanation":"Students may assume larger animals have more delicate proteins, but fish proteins denature at lower temperatures."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about delicate foods.","sentence":"Delicate foods like fish and eggs have tender {{blank:1}} that can be damaged by aggressive cooking methods.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"proteins","correctExplanation":"Fish and eggs are primarily protein-based foods with delicate protein structures that break down or become tough with excessive heat.","distractors":[{"answer":"starches","explanation":"Fish and eggs contain protein, not starch. Starch is found in potatoes, flour, and grains."},{"answer":"sugars","explanation":"Fish and eggs are protein foods; sugars are found in fruits and processed foods."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about cooking eggs.","sentence":"Poaching an egg at 70-80°C keeps the white {{blank:1}} and the yolk runny.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"soft","correctExplanation":"The gentle poaching temperature allows the egg white proteins to coagulate gently, resulting in a soft, tender white rather than a rubbery one.","distractors":[{"answer":"raw","explanation":"The white is cooked at poaching temperature, not raw; it becomes opaque and soft."},{"answer":"crispy","explanation":"Crispy egg whites result from frying at high heat, not gentle poaching."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about cooking fish.","sentence":"Fish is considered properly cooked when it {{blank:1}} easily with a fork.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"flakes","correctExplanation":"When fish proteins are properly coagulated, the muscle fibres separate into flakes when pressed with a fork.","distractors":[{"answer":"bounces","explanation":"Bouncy texture suggests the fish is undercooked or has a rubbery texture."},{"answer":"crumbles","explanation":"Crumbling suggests the fish is overcooked and falling apart."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"Why does boiling break apart delicate fish while poaching keeps it intact?","correct":"Boiling creates turbulent water movement that physically damages the fragile structure","correctExplanation":"At 100°C, vigorous bubbles create turbulence that tosses and breaks delicate fish. Poaching at 70-80°C has no turbulence, keeping the fish intact.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because boiling water contains chemicals that dissolve fish proteins","explanation":"Water doesn't contain fish-dissolving chemicals; the issue is physical turbulence."},{"answer":"Because poaching water is a different substance than boiling water","explanation":"Both use the same water; the difference is temperature and resulting turbulence."},{"answer":"Because fish can only absorb nutrients from water below 80°C","explanation":"Fish doesn't absorb nutrients from cooking water; the issue is physical handling of the delicate structure."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why are scrambled eggs best cooked over low heat?","correct":"Low heat allows proteins to coagulate gently, keeping the eggs soft and creamy","correctExplanation":"Gentle heat coagulates egg proteins slowly, trapping moisture and creating a soft, creamy curd. High heat causes rapid, tight coagulation, producing rubbery, dry eggs.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because high heat would make the eggs explode in the pan immediately","explanation":"Eggs don't explode; high heat makes them rubbery and dry through rapid coagulation."},{"answer":"Because scrambled eggs must be cooked for at least 30 minutes to be safe","explanation":"Scrambled eggs cook in minutes; low heat is about texture quality, not safety timing."},{"answer":"Because eggs release toxic compounds when heated above 80°C in a pan","explanation":"Eggs don't release toxic compounds; high heat simply produces tough, rubbery texture."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why is steaming considered gentle even though steam is at 100°C?","correct":"Because the food sits above the water and isn't subjected to turbulent bubbling","correctExplanation":"In steaming, food doesn't contact boiling water. Steam transfers heat evenly without the physical agitation of bubbles, making it gentle for delicate foods.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because steam is actually much cooler than 100°C when it touches food","explanation":"Steam from boiling water is at 100°C; the gentleness comes from lack of turbulence."},{"answer":"Because steam cooks food in under 30 seconds so there's no time for damage","explanation":"Steaming takes several minutes; its gentleness comes from lack of liquid contact."},{"answer":"Because the steam basket filters heat before it reaches the delicate food","explanation":"Steam passes freely through baskets; they don't filter or reduce heat."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is the relationship between protein structure and cooking temperature for delicate foods?","correct":"Delicate proteins denature at lower temperatures, so gentle heat is sufficient","correctExplanation":"Fish and egg proteins denature at lower temperatures than meat. Using gentle methods ensures these proteins coagulate properly without becoming tough.","distractors":[{"answer":"All proteins require the same temperature regardless of the food source","explanation":"Different proteins denature at different temperatures; fish proteins are more heat-sensitive than meat."},{"answer":"Delicate foods need higher temperatures to cook their proteins properly","explanation":"The opposite is true; delicate proteins need lower temperatures to avoid becoming tough."},{"answer":"Protein structure has no connection to the cooking temperature needed","explanation":"Protein structure directly determines the ideal cooking temperature and method."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why would a chef choose to poach a pear rather than boil it?","correct":"Poaching preserves the pear's shape and texture while gently cooking it through","correctExplanation":"Pears have a delicate structure. Poaching at 70-80°C cooks them gently without turbulence. Boiling would cause them to break apart and become mushy.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because pears can only be cooked in sugar syrup, never in plain water","explanation":"Pears can be cooked in various liquids; poaching is chosen for its gentleness, not the liquid."},{"answer":"Because boiling would make the pear poisonous and unsafe to eat","explanation":"Boiled pears are safe; the issue is texture and shape, not safety."},{"answer":"Because poaching takes less time than boiling for cooking fruit","explanation":"Poaching is slower due to lower temperature; it's chosen for quality, not speed."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Explain why overcooking makes meat tough and dry.","correct":"Proteins contract tightly, squeezing water out like wringing a sponge","correctExplanation":"When proteins are heated excessively, they coagulate too tightly, contracting and forcing out moisture. This is similar to wringing water out of a sponge.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because heat evaporates all the water inside the meat cells instantly","explanation":"Moisture loss is from protein contraction, not direct evaporation of water from cells."},{"answer":"Because cooking creates new tough fibres that replace the original ones","explanation":"Cooking doesn't create new fibres; it causes existing proteins to contract and lose moisture."},{"answer":"Because the fat in meat burns away completely when it is overcooked","explanation":"While fat can render out, the toughness comes primarily from protein contraction, not fat loss."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Tofu is considered a delicate food that benefits from gentle cooking methods.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"Tofu has a soft, fragile structure that can break apart with aggressive cooking. Gentle methods like steaming, poaching, or gentle stir-frying help maintain its shape.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Students may not think of tofu as delicate, but its soft structure can easily break with rough handling."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about cooking science.","sentence":"Fish proteins denature at {{blank:1}} temperatures than meat proteins, which is why fish needs gentler cooking.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"lower","correctExplanation":"Fish proteins are more sensitive to heat and denature at lower temperatures than meat proteins, requiring gentler cooking methods.","distractors":[{"answer":"higher","explanation":"Fish proteins denature at lower temperatures, not higher, making them more delicate."},{"answer":"the same","explanation":"Fish and meat proteins denature at different temperatures; fish is lower."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about overcooking.","sentence":"Overcooked proteins become tough because they {{blank:1}} tightly, squeezing out the moisture from the food.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"contract","correctExplanation":"When proteins are overheated, they coagulate excessively and contract, forcing water out and creating tough, dry texture.","distractors":[{"answer":"expand","explanation":"Proteins contract when overcooked, not expand; the contraction forces moisture out."},{"answer":"dissolve","explanation":"Proteins don't dissolve when overcooked; they tighten and become firm."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about gentle cooking.","sentence":"Steaming is gentle because the food sits {{blank:1}} the boiling water, avoiding direct contact with turbulent liquid.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"above","correctExplanation":"In steaming, food is placed on a rack or in a basket above the boiling water, cooking from the steam without touching the turbulent liquid below.","distractors":[{"answer":"inside","explanation":"Food inside the water would be boiling or simmering, not steaming."},{"answer":"beneath","explanation":"Food beneath the water would be submerged, which is boiling, not steaming."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"You are cooking a piece of fresh barramundi for dinner. Which method will give the best result?","correct":"Poach it gently in a flavoured liquid at 70-80°C","correctExplanation":"Barramundi is a delicate fish with tender flesh. Poaching at 70-80°C cooks it through gently, keeping it moist and intact.","distractors":[{"answer":"Boil it vigorously for 10 minutes in salted water","explanation":"Vigorous boiling would break the delicate fish apart and make it dry."},{"answer":"Deep fry it without batter at 190°C until crispy","explanation":"Deep frying without batter at high temperature would overcook and dry out the delicate fish."},{"answer":"Grill it on maximum heat for 15 minutes per side","explanation":"15 minutes of high-heat grilling would severely overcook the fish."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A student is making soft scrambled eggs but they turned out dry and rubbery. What did they do wrong?","correct":"They cooked the eggs over too high heat for too long","correctExplanation":"High heat causes egg proteins to coagulate rapidly and tightly, squeezing out moisture. Gentle, low heat with frequent stirring creates soft, creamy curds.","distractors":[{"answer":"They used too many eggs for the size of the pan","explanation":"The number of eggs affects portion size, not texture. Rubbery eggs come from excessive heat."},{"answer":"They didn't add enough salt to the egg mixture before cooking","explanation":"Salt affects flavour, not whether eggs become rubbery. The issue is cooking temperature."},{"answer":"They stirred the eggs too much during the cooking process","explanation":"For scrambled eggs, frequent stirring actually helps create smaller, softer curds."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"You want to cook zucchini so it stays slightly firm and doesn't turn to mush. Which approach is best?","correct":"Steam briefly until just tender, then remove from heat immediately","correctExplanation":"Brief steaming cooks zucchini gently without waterlogging. Removing it promptly prevents overcooking, maintaining a slight firmness.","distractors":[{"answer":"Boil for 20 minutes until completely soft and falling apart","explanation":"20 minutes of boiling would turn zucchini into mush; it is a quick-cooking vegetable."},{"answer":"Bake in the oven at 250°C for 30 minutes until charred","explanation":"250°C for 30 minutes would severely overcook zucchini into charred mush."},{"answer":"Any method works equally well because zucchini is very robust","explanation":"Zucchini is relatively delicate and overcooks easily with aggressive methods."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A recipe calls for poaching chicken breast in stock. Why is poaching better than boiling for chicken breast?","correct":"Chicken breast is lean and dry so gentle poaching keeps it moist","correctExplanation":"Chicken breast has no fat or collagen to keep it moist. Poaching at 70-80°C cooks it gently without squeezing out moisture, keeping it juicy.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because boiling chicken creates harmful chemicals that poaching does not","explanation":"Boiling doesn't create harmful chemicals; the issue is that it overcooks the lean meat, drying it out."},{"answer":"Because poaching flavours the chicken more than boiling ever could","explanation":"Both methods can infuse flavour; poaching is chosen for moisture retention in lean meat."},{"answer":"Because chicken can only reach safe temperature through poaching methods","explanation":"Chicken can reach safe temperature through any cooking method; poaching is chosen for texture."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"You are hosting a dinner party and need to serve perfectly soft-boiled eggs (firm white, runny yolk). How do you achieve this?","correct":"Cook eggs in water at about 65-70°C, between white and yolk coagulation temperatures","correctExplanation":"At 65-70°C, the white (62-65°C) coagulates and sets while the yolk (65-70°C) remains soft. This precise temperature control produces the desired result.","distractors":[{"answer":"Boil at 100°C for exactly 1 minute to partially cook the egg","explanation":"1 minute at 100°C doesn't allow even cooking; temperature control is more reliable than timing alone."},{"answer":"Crack the eggs into cold water then slowly bring to the boil","explanation":"This method doesn't give precise temperature control for the specific texture desired."},{"answer":"Microwave the eggs for 30 seconds on medium power setting","explanation":"Microwaving eggs can be unpredictable and may cause them to explode."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A friend says 'just cook everything on high heat — it's faster.' Why is this bad advice for delicate foods?","correct":"High heat overcooks delicate proteins, making them tough, rubbery, or broken apart","correctExplanation":"Delicate foods like fish, eggs, and soft vegetables need gentle heat. High heat causes rapid protein coagulation resulting in tough, dry, or physically damaged food.","distractors":[{"answer":"High heat is actually fine for all foods and produces identical results","explanation":"Different foods require different approaches; delicate foods are damaged by high heat."},{"answer":"High heat only affects the outside of food, leaving the inside perfectly cooked","explanation":"High heat affects the entire food as heat transfers inward, overcooking outer layers while undercooking centres."},{"answer":"The advice is correct for delicate foods but wrong for tough cuts of meat","explanation":"The advice is wrong for delicate foods and partially right for browning tough cuts, but not for slow cooking them."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"You are steaming a piece of tofu for a salad. Halfway through, you notice it's starting to crack and break apart. What should you do?","correct":"Reduce the steaming time and remove it sooner as it may be overcooked","correctExplanation":"Tofu is delicate and can break apart if overcooked. Reducing cooking time preserves its shape and texture.","distractors":[{"answer":"Increase the heat to finish cooking it faster before more damage occurs","explanation":"More heat would worsen the problem; tofu needs less cooking, not more."},{"answer":"Press the tofu harder to reshape it after removing it from the steamer","explanation":"Pressing broken tofu would damage it further, not repair it."},{"answer":"Switch to boiling the tofu to prevent further cracking from the steam","explanation":"Boiling would be more aggressive than steaming and would cause more damage."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about cooking technique.","sentence":"When poaching eggs, the water should show no visible {{blank:1}}, just slight surface movement, to keep the eggs intact.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"bubbles","correctExplanation":"Poaching temperature (70-80°C) produces no visible bubbles. Bubbles would indicate the temperature is too high and would break the delicate egg apart.","distractors":[{"answer":"colour","explanation":"Water clarity isn't the indicator; the absence of bubbles shows correct poaching temperature."},{"answer":"steam","explanation":"Some steam may be present; the key indicator is no visible bubbles in the water."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about protein sensitivity.","sentence":"Eggs are considered delicate because their whites coagulate at only {{blank:1}}°C, requiring gentle cooking to avoid toughness.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"62-65","correctExplanation":"Egg white proteins begin coagulating at the relatively low temperature of 62-65°C, making them sensitive to overcooking.","distractors":[{"answer":"85-95","explanation":"85-95°C is the simmering range, well above egg white coagulation temperature."},{"answer":"100","explanation":"100°C is the boiling point; egg whites coagulate at the much lower 62-65°C."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about cooking choices.","sentence":"Chicken breast has no {{blank:1}} to keep it moist during cooking, so gentle methods like poaching help prevent it from drying out.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"fat","correctExplanation":"Unlike thighs or other cuts, chicken breast is very lean with minimal fat. Without fat to provide moisture, it dries out easily with aggressive cooking.","distractors":[{"answer":"protein","explanation":"Chicken breast has plenty of protein; it's the lack of fat that causes dryness."},{"answer":"bone","explanation":"While boneless breast is common, the lack of fat is the main reason it dries out, not the absence of bone."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why the same cooking method (boiling at 100°C) produces excellent results for pasta but ruins fish.","correct":"Pasta needs turbulence to prevent sticking and is structurally robust; fish is fragile and breaks apart","correctExplanation":"Pasta requires the agitation of boiling to prevent sticking and cook evenly. Fish's delicate protein structure and fragile flesh cannot withstand the same turbulence.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because pasta is made from plants and fish is an animal product which always needs gentle cooking","explanation":"The distinction isn't plant vs animal; it's about structural robustness and protein sensitivity."},{"answer":"Because pasta absorbs water at 100°C but fish releases water at 100°C","explanation":"Both absorb and release water; the difference is structural integrity under turbulence."},{"answer":"Because boiling water changes chemistry when fish is added but not when pasta is added","explanation":"The water doesn't change; the foods respond differently due to their structural properties."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare the approach of a chef who cooks all eggs at low temperature versus one who uses high heat for fried eggs. Evaluate both approaches.","correct":"Low heat gives softer results; high heat gives crispy edges — each suits different dishes","correctExplanation":"Low heat produces tender, evenly cooked eggs (scrambled, poached). High heat creates contrast — crispy browned edges with a softer centre (fried). Both are valid for different goals.","distractors":[{"answer":"Low heat is always correct and high heat should never be used for cooking eggs","explanation":"High heat frying produces desirable crispy edges; both approaches have valid culinary applications."},{"answer":"High heat is always better because it cooks eggs faster and more evenly","explanation":"High heat cooks unevenly (overcooked outside, potentially undercooked inside) and isn't always desirable."},{"answer":"Both approaches produce identical results because eggs cook the same at any temperature","explanation":"Temperature dramatically affects egg texture: soft vs rubbery, creamy vs crispy."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A cooking student argues that microwave cooking is the gentlest method because it doesn't use water or direct heat. Evaluate this claim.","correct":"Microwaves can be gentle for some foods but can also overcook proteins very quickly due to uneven heating","correctExplanation":"Microwaves heat unevenly, creating hot spots that can overcook delicate proteins. While no water is used, the rapid, uneven heating can make eggs rubbery or fish dry.","distractors":[{"answer":"The student is completely correct because microwaves are always the gentlest cooking method","explanation":"Microwaves can overcook proteins rapidly through uneven heating, making them far from always gentle."},{"answer":"The student is wrong because microwaves cannot cook food at all without water present","explanation":"Microwaves can cook food without added water by exciting water molecules within the food itself."},{"answer":"The student is wrong because microwaves always completely destroy all nutrients in food","explanation":"Microwaves actually retain nutrients well in many cases; the issue is uneven heating of proteins."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the statement: 'If you can cook a steak, you can cook fish the same way.'","correct":"This is incorrect because fish proteins are far more delicate and require different techniques","correctExplanation":"Steak benefits from high heat for browning and can handle searing. Fish has delicate proteins that denature at lower temperatures and fragile flesh that breaks with rough handling.","distractors":[{"answer":"This is correct because all proteins cook the same way regardless of the source","explanation":"Different proteins have different denaturation temperatures and structural properties."},{"answer":"This is correct because both steak and fish should be cooked over high heat","explanation":"Fish requires gentler methods; treating it like steak would overcook and break it apart."},{"answer":"This is incorrect but only because fish takes longer to cook than steak does","explanation":"Fish often cooks faster than steak; the issue is the method and temperature needed, not time."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse the concept of 'carryover cooking' and why it is particularly important for delicate foods.","correct":"Residual heat continues cooking food after removal from heat, risking overcooking delicate items","correctExplanation":"After removing food from heat, internal temperature can rise 3-5°C from residual heat. For delicate foods near their ideal doneness, this can push them into overcooked territory.","distractors":[{"answer":"Carryover cooking only applies to large roasts and never affects small delicate foods","explanation":"Carryover affects all foods; it's more critical for delicate foods because the margin for error is smaller."},{"answer":"Carryover cooking improves delicate foods by adding extra flavour during resting","explanation":"Carryover doesn't add flavour; it's continued cooking that can overcook delicate proteins."},{"answer":"Carryover cooking means food must be reheated after resting before it can be served","explanation":"Carryover means residual heat keeps cooking; food doesn't need reheating after resting."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the trade-off between flavour development and texture preservation when cooking delicate fish.","correct":"High heat creates browning for flavour but risks overcooking; gentle methods preserve texture but skip browning","correctExplanation":"Searing fish creates Maillard browning for flavour but can overcook the flesh. Poaching preserves moisture and texture but doesn't create browning. Chefs often sear briefly then finish gently.","distractors":[{"answer":"There is no trade-off because gentle methods always produce better flavour and texture","explanation":"Gentle methods preserve texture but miss the complex flavours that browning creates."},{"answer":"High heat always produces superior results for fish in every situation","explanation":"High heat risks overcooking; the trade-off between flavour and texture is real."},{"answer":"The trade-off only applies to red meat and not to any seafood or fish","explanation":"The flavour-texture trade-off applies to all proteins, including delicate fish."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A home cook successfully poaches eggs but wants them to have crispy edges too. Analyse what cooking approach could achieve this.","correct":"Poach first for a soft interior, then briefly fry in butter for crispy edges","correctExplanation":"Combining methods achieves both goals: poaching sets the egg gently (soft white, runny yolk), then a brief high-heat fry adds crispy edges without overcooking the interior.","distractors":[{"answer":"It is impossible to have both soft and crispy elements on the same egg","explanation":"Combination techniques can achieve contrasting textures on the same food."},{"answer":"Simply fry the egg on high heat for longer to get both soft and crispy","explanation":"Longer high-heat frying would overcook the whole egg, not create a soft interior."},{"answer":"Poach for a much longer time which will eventually create crispy edges","explanation":"Poaching in liquid cannot create crispy edges regardless of duration."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why understanding protein denaturation temperatures is essential for cooking delicate foods perfectly.","correct":"Knowing exact temperatures lets you cook proteins to their ideal state without overcooking","correctExplanation":"Egg whites set at 62-65°C, yolks at 65-70°C, fish at slightly higher. Knowing these allows precise cooking for exact textures—soft yolk, firm white, flaky fish.","distractors":[{"answer":"Denaturation temperatures are theoretical and have no practical application in the kitchen","explanation":"These temperatures are highly practical: they explain how to cook eggs to exact textures and keep fish moist."},{"answer":"Only professional chefs need to know denaturation temperatures, not home cooks","explanation":"All cooks benefit from understanding why gentle heat improves delicate food results."},{"answer":"All proteins denature at the same temperature so this knowledge is unnecessary","explanation":"Different proteins denature at different temperatures, which is why method matters for each food."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about cooking strategy.","sentence":"To get both browning and tenderness on fish, a chef might {{blank:1}} the surface briefly then finish with a gentler method.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"sear","correctExplanation":"A quick sear at high heat creates Maillard browning on the surface, then switching to gentle heat (oven or poaching) cooks the interior without overcooking.","distractors":[{"answer":"boil","explanation":"Boiling cannot create browning; it's a wet method that keeps temperatures at 100°C."},{"answer":"freeze","explanation":"Freezing doesn't cook food; searing is the technique for quick surface browning."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about carryover cooking.","sentence":"Delicate foods should be removed from heat slightly {{blank:1}} they reach the target temperature because residual heat continues cooking them.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"before","correctExplanation":"Carryover cooking means internal temperature rises after removal from heat. Removing delicate foods slightly early accounts for this continued cooking.","distractors":[{"answer":"after","explanation":"Removing after the target temperature would result in overcooking due to carryover heat."},{"answer":"when","explanation":"Removing exactly at target temperature risks overcooking from residual heat in delicate foods."}]}}}
