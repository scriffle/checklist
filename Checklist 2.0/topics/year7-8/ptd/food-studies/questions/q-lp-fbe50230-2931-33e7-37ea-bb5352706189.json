      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Freezing followed by deep-frying", "explanation": "Braising does not involve freezing or deep-frying. It combines searing (dry heat) with slow cooking in liquid (wet heat)." },

      "correct": "The Maillard reaction browns the surface, creating rich flavour and colour",

      "correct": "Aromatics like onion, garlic, and herbs add flavour that infuses into the meat and liquid over the long cooking time",
      "correctExplanation": "During the hours of slow cooking, aromatic vegetables and herbs release their flavours into the braising liquid, which in turn infuses into the meat, building complex flavour.",

      "correct": "Gelatin from converted collagen dissolves into the liquid, naturally thickening it, while meat juices and aromatics add depth of flavour",
      "correctExplanation": "As collagen in the meat converts to gelatin during slow cooking, it enriches and naturally thickens the braising liquid alongside the flavours from aromatics and meat juices.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The cook must add cornflour at the end because braising liquid is always thin and watery", "explanation": "While thickeners may be added, braising liquid naturally thickens from gelatin released by collagen conversion." },

      "correct": "Tough cuts have abundant collagen that converts to gelatin during the long, slow, wet cooking phase, producing tender meat and a rich sauce",
      "correctExplanation": "The combination of dry searing for flavour and hours of wet cooking for collagen conversion makes braising ideal for tough, collagen-rich cuts.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Tough cuts are braised only because they are too large for any other cooking method", "explanation": "Size is not the reason. Braising suits tough cuts because the slow, wet cooking converts their collagen to gelatin." },

      "correct": "Excess liquid can dilute the concentration of flavour in the sauce and create a thinner, less rich braising liquid even though the meat itself may still become tender",
      "correctExplanation": "The correct technique uses just enough liquid to partially cover the meat. This concentrates flavour in the sauce. Too much liquid creates a diluted, less flavourful result.",
