    {"type":"mc","question":"What does 'blind testing' mean in sensory evaluation?","correct":"Tasters do not know which product is which, as samples are identified only by codes","correctExplanation":"Blind testing prevents knowledge about the product from influencing perception. Tasters evaluate based only on what they sense, not what they expect.","distractors":[{"answer":"Tasters wear blindfolds so they cannot see the food","explanation":"While vision can be controlled, blind testing primarily means tasters do not know which product is which."},{"answer":"Tasters evaluate food in a dark room with no lights","explanation":"Blind testing refers to hiding product identity, not removing light. Samples are coded to prevent identification."},{"answer":"Only people who cannot see are allowed to be tasters","explanation":"Blind testing means concealing product identity from all tasters, not restricting who can participate."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why should samples be labelled with random 3-digit codes instead of 'Sample A' and 'Sample B'?","correct":"Because letters like A and B can create bias — people may assume A is the better or original product","correctExplanation":"Labelling with A, B, C can introduce bias because people associate earlier letters with better quality. Random codes like 472, 815 eliminate this.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because random codes look more professional","explanation":"The reason is to prevent bias, not aesthetics. Letters can create unconscious expectations about quality."},{"answer":"Because tasters cannot read letters, only numbers","explanation":"Tasters can read both. The issue is that letters create ordinal bias that random codes avoid."},{"answer":"There is no reason — letters and numbers work equally well","explanation":"Letters create order bias (A seems better than C). Random 3-digit codes are genuinely more neutral."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why should tasters not talk to each other during sensory testing?","correct":"Because discussion can influence opinions and change what tasters perceive or report","correctExplanation":"If one taster says 'this sample is saltier,' others may agree even if they did not originally notice. Independent evaluation prevents this social influence.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because talking makes the room too noisy for accurate tasting","explanation":"Noise is not the primary concern. The issue is that others' opinions can influence individual perception and reporting."},{"answer":"Because it is rude to talk while eating food samples","explanation":"The reason is scientific, not about manners. Discussion introduces bias into independent sensory evaluations."},{"answer":"Talking is actually fine and has no effect on sensory test results","explanation":"Research confirms that social influence significantly affects sensory evaluation. Independent testing is essential."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why should all samples be served at the same temperature?","correct":"Because temperature differences could affect taste and texture perception, creating unfair comparisons","correctExplanation":"If one sample is warmer than another, it may release more aromas or have different texture, affecting evaluation independently of the actual product differences.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because the law requires all food to be served at the same temperature","explanation":"There is no such law. Equal temperatures ensure differences in perception come from the products, not temperature variation."},{"answer":"Because tasters might burn their mouths on hot samples","explanation":"Safety is important but the scientific reason is that temperature affects taste and aroma perception."},{"answer":"Temperature has no effect on food perception so it does not matter","explanation":"Temperature significantly affects aroma release, taste perception, and texture. It must be controlled for fair testing."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What should tasters use between samples to cleanse their palate?","correct":"Water or a plain cracker","correctExplanation":"Water or a plain cracker removes residual flavours from the previous sample, ensuring each sample is evaluated independently without carryover.","distractors":[{"answer":"A strongly flavoured mint to refresh the mouth","explanation":"Strong flavours would interfere with the next sample. Neutral palate cleansers like water or plain crackers are used."},{"answer":"Nothing — palate cleansing is unnecessary between samples","explanation":"Palate cleansing is essential. Without it, flavours from one sample carry over and affect perception of the next."},{"answer":"A different food sample to reset the taste buds","explanation":"Another food would add its own flavours. Neutral cleansers like water ensure a clean palate."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Tasters should record their results immediately after tasting each sample.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"Immediate recording captures first impressions accurately. Waiting allows memory to fade or be influenced by subsequent samples.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Immediate recording is important because sensory impressions fade quickly and can be influenced by later samples."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"It is acceptable for tasters to discuss their opinions before recording results.","correct":"False","correctExplanation":"Discussion before recording introduces social bias. Each taster must form and record their own independent opinion without influence from others.","distractors":[{"answer":"True","explanation":"Discussion introduces bias. Tasters must record their own independent evaluations before any group discussion."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about blind testing.","sentence":"In blind testing, samples are labelled with random {{blank:1}} to prevent tasters from knowing which product is which.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"codes","correctExplanation":"Random 3-digit codes (like 472, 815) replace product names to prevent knowledge of product identity from influencing evaluation.","distractors":[{"answer":"names","explanation":"Product names would reveal identity and create bias. Random codes keep testing blind."},{"answer":"colours","explanation":"Colour-coding can create associations. Random numerical codes are the most neutral labelling method."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about preventing social bias.","sentence":"Tasters should not {{blank:1}} with each other during testing because others' opinions can influence their own perceptions.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"talk","correctExplanation":"Talking allows one taster's opinion to influence others, compromising the independence of each evaluation.","distractors":[{"answer":"sit","explanation":"Sitting near others is acceptable in controlled conditions. It is talking that creates bias through social influence."},{"answer":"eat","explanation":"Eating samples is the purpose of the test. It is talking that must be prevented to avoid bias."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about sample consistency.","sentence":"All samples should be served at the same {{blank:1}}, in the same quantity, and in identical containers to ensure a fair comparison.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"temperature","correctExplanation":"Consistent temperature ensures differences in perception come from the product itself, not from temperature variation affecting taste and aroma.","distractors":[{"answer":"time","explanation":"While timing matters, temperature is the critical variable that directly affects taste and aroma perception."},{"answer":"price","explanation":"Price is not relevant to sensory testing conditions. Temperature consistency is essential for fair evaluation."}]}}}
  ],
  "toLevel3": [
    {"type":"mc","question":"How does knowing a product's brand name affect sensory evaluation?","correct":"Brand knowledge creates expectations that influence perceived taste, often making familiar brands taste 'better' regardless of actual quality","correctExplanation":"Brand bias is well-documented. In blind tests, people often cannot distinguish between brands they claim to prefer, showing that expectations affect perception.","distractors":[{"answer":"Brand names have no effect on taste perception whatsoever","explanation":"Extensive research shows brand names significantly influence perceived taste through expectation bias."},{"answer":"Knowing the brand makes tasters more accurate in their evaluations","explanation":"Brand knowledge introduces bias rather than accuracy. Blind testing produces more honest sensory evaluations."},{"answer":"Only children are influenced by brand names; adults evaluate objectively","explanation":"Brand bias affects people of all ages. Even trained tasters can be influenced by brand expectations."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why should the presentation order of samples be randomised for each taster?","correct":"Because the first sample often receives different ratings than later samples due to order effects","correctExplanation":"Order effects mean the first sample may be rated higher (novelty effect) or lower (palate is not yet warmed up). Randomisation distributes this bias evenly.","distractors":[{"answer":"Randomisation is done to confuse tasters and make the test harder","explanation":"Randomisation is not about difficulty. It prevents systematic order effects from biasing results toward any particular sample."},{"answer":"The order does not matter because all samples taste the same regardless of sequence","explanation":"Order genuinely affects perception. Randomisation ensures order effects do not systematically favour any sample."},{"answer":"Only the first sample's order matters; the rest can be in any sequence","explanation":"Order effects occur throughout the tasting sequence. All positions should be randomised across tasters."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is the purpose of using identical containers for all samples?","correct":"To prevent visual differences in containers from influencing tasters' expectations and perceptions","correctExplanation":"If samples are in different containers, tasters might assume differences in quality. Identical containers ensure evaluation is based on the food, not packaging.","distractors":[{"answer":"To make the testing area look neat and organised","explanation":"While organisation is helpful, the scientific reason is to prevent container differences from biasing sensory perception."},{"answer":"Because different containers change the actual taste of the food","explanation":"While some containers can affect taste, the primary reason is preventing visual bias from different containers."},{"answer":"There is no reason — any containers can be used","explanation":"Container differences can create unconscious bias. Identical containers ensure perception is based on the food itself."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why should all samples contain the same quantity of food?","correct":"Because quantity differences could affect perceived intensity and overall impression of the samples","correctExplanation":"A larger portion might seem more flavourful or generous, biasing evaluation. Equal quantities ensure differences in perception come from the product, not serving size.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because tasters might complain if they receive different amounts","explanation":"While fairness matters, the scientific reason is that quantity differences affect perceived flavour intensity."},{"answer":"Quantity has no effect on taste perception","explanation":"Quantity can affect perceived intensity and overall impression. Equal amounts prevent this bias."},{"answer":"Larger samples always taste better than smaller ones","explanation":"While quantity can influence perception, it does not always make food taste 'better.' The point is to control this variable."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is 'expectation bias' and how does it affect sensory testing?","correct":"When tasters know something about a product, their expectations change what they perceive or report","correctExplanation":"If told a sample is 'premium,' tasters may perceive it as tasting better. Expectation bias shows our brain's expectations literally alter sensory perception.","distractors":[{"answer":"Expectation bias is when tasters expect to be paid for participating in tests","explanation":"Expectation bias refers to how knowledge and expectations about food alter sensory perception, not about payment expectations."},{"answer":"Expectation bias only affects untrained tasters and never affects experts","explanation":"Expectation bias affects everyone, including trained experts. This is why blind testing is standard in professional evaluations."},{"answer":"Expectation bias is a myth that has been disproven by research","explanation":"Expectation bias is extensively documented in sensory science research. It is a genuine and significant phenomenon."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"List three conditions that must be controlled for fair sensory testing.","correct":"Temperature, quantity, and container type must all be identical across samples","correctExplanation":"These three physical conditions must be equal so that any perceived differences between samples are due to the food itself, not the serving conditions.","distractors":[{"answer":"The taster's age, gender, and height must be controlled","explanation":"While panel selection matters, the question asks about conditions of sample presentation, not taster demographics."},{"answer":"The time of day, weather, and taster's mood cannot be controlled so testing is unreliable","explanation":"While these factors exist, controlling sample conditions (temperature, quantity, containers) significantly improves reliability."},{"answer":"Only temperature matters; quantity and containers have no effect","explanation":"All three affect perception. Quantity affects intensity; container differences create visual bias; temperature affects taste and aroma."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Labelling samples as 'new recipe' and 'old recipe' would introduce bias into a sensory test.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"These labels reveal which sample is different and create expectations. Tasters may prefer the 'new' recipe out of curiosity or the 'old' one out of familiarity.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Descriptive labels introduce significant bias. Random codes should be used instead to keep the test blind."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about expectation bias.","sentence":"If tasters know a sample is 'premium,' they may perceive it as tasting {{blank:1}} even if it is identical to a standard product.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"better","correctExplanation":"Expectation bias causes the brain to perceive quality consistent with expectations. 'Premium' labelling leads to higher quality perception.","distractors":[{"answer":"worse","explanation":"Premium labelling typically biases perception positively, not negatively. People expect premium products to taste better."},{"answer":"identical","explanation":"If expectations had no effect, blind and labelled tests would give the same results. Research shows expectations change perception."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about order effects.","sentence":"Sample presentation order must be {{blank:1}} for each taster to prevent the position of a sample from affecting its rating.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"randomised","correctExplanation":"Randomisation ensures that order effects (like first-sample bias) are distributed evenly across all samples.","distractors":[{"answer":"alphabetical","explanation":"Alphabetical order creates a consistent pattern that could systematically bias results. Randomisation prevents this."},{"answer":"reversed","explanation":"Simply reversing order for alternate tasters is less effective than full randomisation across all possible orders."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about recording results.","sentence":"Tasters should record their evaluations {{blank:1}} after tasting each sample to capture accurate first impressions.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"immediately","correctExplanation":"Immediate recording captures genuine sensory impressions before they fade or are influenced by subsequent samples or other tasters.","distractors":[{"answer":"later","explanation":"Delayed recording allows memory to fade and other influences to alter perception. Immediate recording is essential."},{"answer":"collectively","explanation":"Collective recording introduces social bias. Each taster must record individually and immediately."}]}}}

  "toLevel4": [
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how colour can introduce bias in sensory evaluation and how this can be controlled.","correct":"Food colour affects taste expectations — red foods are expected to be sweeter. Using coloured lighting or opaque cups can control this bias","correctExplanation":"Research shows colour changes perceived flavour. Red-coloured drinks are rated sweeter. Coloured lighting or identical-looking samples eliminate visual cues.","distractors":[{"answer":"Colour has no effect on taste perception so it does not need to be controlled","explanation":"Extensive research proves colour significantly influences perceived taste. It must be controlled in fair testing."},{"answer":"The only way to control colour bias is to have all tasters close their eyes","explanation":"While closing eyes works, red lighting or opaque containers are more practical and equally effective."},{"answer":"Colour bias only affects children, not adult tasters","explanation":"Colour bias affects people of all ages, including trained professionals. It must be controlled in all sensory testing."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse the concept of 'double-blind' testing and why it is more rigorous than single-blind testing.","correct":"In double-blind testing, neither the taster nor the person serving samples knows which is which, eliminating server bias","correctExplanation":"If the server knows which sample is the test product, they might unconsciously give verbal or non-verbal cues. Double-blind eliminates this.","distractors":[{"answer":"Double-blind means tasters try each sample twice, which is unnecessary","explanation":"Double-blind refers to both taster and server being unaware of sample identity, not to double tasting."},{"answer":"Double-blind and single-blind provide identical results so there is no advantage","explanation":"Server knowledge can unconsciously influence tasters. Double-blind eliminates this additional source of bias."},{"answer":"Double-blind testing is only used in medicine, never in food science","explanation":"Double-blind methodology is used in food science sensory evaluation when the highest rigour is needed."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how environmental factors in the testing room can introduce bias.","correct":"Noise, odours, lighting, and temperature in the room can all affect sensory perception and must be controlled","correctExplanation":"Cooking smells from nearby kitchens, bright or dim lighting, room temperature, and noise levels all influence how tasters perceive food samples.","distractors":[{"answer":"The testing environment has no effect on sensory evaluation results","explanation":"Environmental factors significantly affect perception. Professional sensory labs are carefully designed to control these variables."},{"answer":"Only room temperature matters; other environmental factors are irrelevant","explanation":"Multiple environmental factors affect perception including odours, lighting, noise, and temperature."},{"answer":"Testing must be conducted outdoors to avoid all environmental bias","explanation":"Outdoor testing introduces uncontrolled variables. Dedicated sensory labs control environmental conditions for reliability."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why sensory evaluation booths are designed with individual partitions.","correct":"Partitions prevent tasters from seeing others' reactions or samples, eliminating visual social influence","correctExplanation":"Individual booths ensure each taster evaluates independently without seeing facial reactions, sample colours, or other tasters' recording behaviour.","distractors":[{"answer":"Partitions are purely decorative and serve no functional purpose","explanation":"Partitions serve the critical function of preventing visual cues and social influence between tasters."},{"answer":"Partitions are used to prevent tasters from stealing each other's samples","explanation":"The purpose is to prevent social bias, not sample theft. Visual isolation ensures independent evaluation."},{"answer":"Partitions make tasters feel more comfortable but do not affect results","explanation":"Partitions genuinely affect results by preventing the social influence that occurs when tasters see each other."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how confirmation bias specifically affects sensory evaluation when testing a new product version.","correct":"Developers may unconsciously perceive their new version more favourably, or testers told it is 'improved' may agree regardless","correctExplanation":"Confirmation bias leads people to perceive and report what they expect. Product developers and informed tasters are susceptible to confirming expected improvements.","distractors":[{"answer":"Confirmation bias does not exist in food testing situations","explanation":"Confirmation bias is well-documented in all evaluation contexts, including sensory testing."},{"answer":"Only product developers experience confirmation bias; external tasters are immune","explanation":"External tasters can also be affected if they know which sample is supposed to be improved."},{"answer":"Confirmation bias makes test results more accurate because people confirm the truth","explanation":"Confirmation bias distorts perception toward expectations, reducing accuracy rather than improving it."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how the time of day and taster hunger level could bias sensory evaluation results.","correct":"Hungry tasters may rate food more positively, and taste sensitivity varies throughout the day, so testing time should be standardised","correctExplanation":"Hunger increases food palatability, and circadian rhythms affect taste sensitivity. Standardising testing time and requiring consistent pre-test fasting controls these variables.","distractors":[{"answer":"Time of day and hunger have no effect on taste perception","explanation":"Both significantly affect taste perception. Professional sensory testing protocols specify testing times and fasting requirements."},{"answer":"Tasters should always be tested when very hungry for maximum sensitivity","explanation":"Extreme hunger biases results positively. Moderate, standardised hunger levels produce more reliable results."},{"answer":"Testing time only matters for liquid samples, not solid foods","explanation":"Time of day and hunger affect perception of all food types equally."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare the bias control requirements for a casual classroom sensory test versus a professional food laboratory test.","correct":"Both need the same principles (blind coding, independence, controls) but laboratory tests implement them more rigorously with standardised protocols","correctExplanation":"The principles are identical, but laboratories use individual booths, controlled lighting, precise temperature control, and statistical methods beyond classroom capabilities.","distractors":[{"answer":"Classroom tests do not need any bias control because they are just for learning","explanation":"Even classroom tests benefit from bias control. Learning to eliminate bias is itself a key learning outcome."},{"answer":"Laboratory tests do not need bias control because professional tasters are immune to bias","explanation":"All humans are susceptible to bias. Laboratories implement rigorous controls specifically because professionals recognise this."},{"answer":"There is no difference in requirements between classroom and laboratory tests","explanation":"The principles are the same but implementation rigour differs significantly between settings."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the analysis of visual bias control.","sentence":"Red-coloured lighting can be used in sensory labs to mask food {{blank:1}} differences that might bias tasters' expectations.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"colour","correctExplanation":"Coloured lighting masks the natural colours of food samples, preventing colour-based expectations from influencing taste perception.","distractors":[{"answer":"temperature","explanation":"Lighting does not mask temperature. Coloured lighting specifically controls visual colour bias."},{"answer":"weight","explanation":"Lighting does not mask weight. Coloured lighting prevents food colour from creating taste expectations."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the analysis of double-blind testing.","sentence":"In a double-blind test, neither the {{blank:1}} nor the person serving samples knows which product is which.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"taster","correctExplanation":"Double-blind testing keeps both the taster and server unaware of sample identity, preventing both expectation and server bias.","distractors":[{"answer":"chef","explanation":"The chef is not typically involved in serving. Double-blind means neither the taster nor the server knows sample identities."},{"answer":"manager","explanation":"Management is not involved in the testing process. Double-blind refers to taster and server blindness."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the analysis of environmental control.","sentence":"Professional sensory labs control room {{blank:1}}, lighting, temperature, and noise to prevent environmental factors from affecting evaluation.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"odours","correctExplanation":"Background odours from cooking or cleaning can interfere with food evaluation. Sensory labs use ventilation and odour control to prevent this.","distractors":[{"answer":"furniture","explanation":"While furniture layout matters for partitions, odour control is the key environmental factor that directly affects sensory evaluation."},{"answer":"colour","explanation":"While wall colour can affect mood, room odours are a more direct sensory interference that must be controlled."}]}}}

  "toLevel5": [
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate whether it is possible to completely eliminate all bias from sensory evaluation.","correct":"Complete elimination is impossible, but systematic controls can minimise bias to levels where results are reliably valid","correctExplanation":"Human perception is inherently subjective. Good experimental design minimises known biases, but some variability remains and is accounted for statistically.","distractors":[{"answer":"Yes, following correct protocols eliminates 100% of all bias permanently","explanation":"No protocol eliminates all bias. Proper controls minimise bias to manageable levels, which statistical analysis accounts for."},{"answer":"No, because bias cannot be reduced at all so all sensory testing is worthless","explanation":"While complete elimination is impossible, bias reduction makes results reliably valid for practical decisions."},{"answer":"Bias elimination depends entirely on the tasters' willingness to be honest","explanation":"Many biases are unconscious. Controls must address unconscious bias through design, not just rely on taster honesty."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the ethical implications of using sensory test results to market products as 'preferred by consumers' or 'better tasting.'","correct":"Such claims require rigorous unbiased methodology — poorly designed tests can produce misleading results used to deceive consumers","correctExplanation":"Marketing claims based on sensory tests must use sound methodology. Biased testing (biased labelling, small samples) can produce results that mislead consumers.","distractors":[{"answer":"Any sensory test result can be used in marketing regardless of methodology quality","explanation":"Misleading marketing claims based on biased testing raise ethical and sometimes legal concerns."},{"answer":"Sensory test results should never be used in marketing under any circumstances","explanation":"Well-designed, unbiased sensory tests can legitimately support marketing claims."},{"answer":"Consumers are never influenced by claims about sensory test results","explanation":"Research shows sensory claims significantly influence purchasing decisions, making methodology integrity important."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how unconscious bias differs from deliberate manipulation in sensory testing and why both must be addressed.","correct":"Unconscious bias distorts results without intent while deliberate manipulation is fraud — proper protocols prevent both","correctExplanation":"Unconscious biases (expectation, order, social) affect honest tasters without their knowledge. Deliberate manipulation involves intentionally skewing results. Rigorous protocols guard against both.","distractors":[{"answer":"Unconscious bias does not exist; all bias in testing is deliberate","explanation":"Unconscious biases are well-documented in psychology and sensory science. They affect perception without awareness."},{"answer":"Only deliberate manipulation needs to be addressed; unconscious bias has no effect","explanation":"Unconscious bias can significantly distort results even when all participants act in good faith."},{"answer":"There is no difference between unconscious bias and deliberate manipulation","explanation":"They differ fundamentally in intent. Unconscious bias is unintentional; manipulation is deliberate. Both affect results."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate how AI and digital tools could improve bias control in sensory evaluation.","correct":"AI could randomise presentation, analyse patterns of bias in data, and standardise evaluation conditions more consistently than manual methods","correctExplanation":"Digital tools can automate randomisation, detect statistical anomalies suggesting bias, and ensure consistent presentation conditions across sessions and locations.","distractors":[{"answer":"AI cannot contribute to bias control in sensory evaluation","explanation":"AI can significantly improve randomisation, bias detection, and standardisation in sensory evaluation protocols."},{"answer":"AI would introduce more bias than it eliminates because algorithms are biased","explanation":"While algorithm bias exists, AI tools for sensory testing focus on randomisation and consistency, which reduce human bias."},{"answer":"AI has already completely replaced human sensory evaluation","explanation":"AI complements human evaluation but cannot replace the subjective sensory perceptions that are the purpose of sensory testing."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the transferable skills students develop when learning to eliminate bias in sensory testing.","correct":"Critical thinking, experimental design, awareness of cognitive biases, and evidence-based reasoning skills that apply broadly","correctExplanation":"Learning to identify and control bias in food testing develops skills directly applicable to evaluating information, designing experiments, and making evidence-based decisions in any field.","distractors":[{"answer":"The skills are only useful for food science and have no broader application","explanation":"Bias awareness and experimental design skills transfer to science, media literacy, decision-making, and critical thinking generally."},{"answer":"Students cannot learn meaningful skills from sensory testing activities","explanation":"Sensory testing teaches practical experimental design and critical thinking skills recognised across disciplines."},{"answer":"Only advanced university students can understand bias in testing","explanation":"Bias concepts are accessible at secondary school level and provide valuable foundations for scientific thinking."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how cross-cultural bias might affect international sensory evaluation studies.","correct":"Different cultural expectations about flavour, texture, and food quality mean results from one culture may not generalise to another","correctExplanation":"Cultural factors influence food preferences and expectations, meaning sensory tests conducted in one country may not represent consumer response in another market.","distractors":[{"answer":"Cultural differences have no effect on sensory evaluation results","explanation":"Cultural background significantly influences food expectations and preferences, affecting sensory evaluation outcomes."},{"answer":"Sensory evaluation can only be conducted within a single cultural group","explanation":"Cross-cultural testing is possible and valuable, but cultural bias must be recognised and accounted for."},{"answer":"All cultures perceive food identically so cross-cultural testing always gives the same results","explanation":"Cultural differences in food experience create genuine variations in perception and preference."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the tension between controlling bias and maintaining ecological validity in sensory testing.","correct":"Highly controlled lab tests minimise bias but may not represent real-world eating conditions; balance is needed","correctExplanation":"Lab conditions control bias but remove context (social dining, environment) that affects real eating. The best approach balances control with realistic conditions.","distractors":[{"answer":"There is no tension because lab conditions perfectly represent real eating","explanation":"Lab conditions differ significantly from real eating environments. This affects how results translate to real-world behaviour."},{"answer":"Ecological validity is irrelevant because only lab conditions matter","explanation":"Products must succeed in real-world conditions. Lab results need to predict real consumer behaviour."},{"answer":"Bias control is irrelevant because only real-world testing matters","explanation":"Both are important. Bias control ensures valid results; ecological validity ensures results predict real-world outcomes."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate how the principles of bias elimination in sensory testing relate to broader scientific methodology.","correct":"The same principles — controlled variables, blinding, randomisation, and independent measurement — are fundamental to all experimental science","correctExplanation":"Sensory evaluation uses the same core scientific methodology as medical trials, psychological research, and other experimental sciences.","distractors":[{"answer":"Sensory evaluation has no connection to other scientific methods","explanation":"Sensory evaluation applies the same fundamental principles of experimental design used across all scientific disciplines."},{"answer":"Only sensory evaluation uses blinding and randomisation; other sciences do not","explanation":"Blinding and randomisation are used across many sciences including medicine, psychology, and agricultural research."},{"answer":"Scientific methodology is too complex for sensory evaluation to apply","explanation":"Sensory evaluation successfully applies scientific methodology, demonstrating its accessibility and universal applicability."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the evaluation of transferable skills.","sentence":"Learning to eliminate bias in sensory testing develops {{blank:1}} thinking skills that apply to evaluating information in any context.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"critical","correctExplanation":"Critical thinking — questioning assumptions, identifying bias, and demanding evidence — is the transferable skill developed through sensory test design.","distractors":[{"answer":"creative","explanation":"While creativity is valuable, the primary transferable skill from bias elimination is critical thinking and evidence evaluation."},{"answer":"mathematical","explanation":"While statistics are involved, the broader transferable skill is critical thinking about bias and evidence."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the evaluation of scientific methodology.","sentence":"Blinding, randomisation, and controlled variables are principles shared between sensory evaluation and all {{blank:1}} science.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"experimental","correctExplanation":"These principles are fundamental to experimental science in all disciplines, from medicine to psychology to food science.","distractors":[{"answer":"theoretical","explanation":"Theoretical science develops models. Experimental science is where blinding and randomisation are directly applied."},{"answer":"historical","explanation":"Historical science reconstructs past events. Experimental science is where controlled testing methodology is applied."}]}}}
