      "question": "Why does roasting vegetables create deeper flavour than boiling them?",
      "correct": "Because the high dry heat triggers the Maillard reaction, producing browning",
      "correctExplanation": "Roasting at high temperatures (above 140°C) in dry conditions causes the Maillard reaction between amino acids and sugars, creating complex flavours and brown colour.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because roasting adds oil which contains more flavour than plain water", "explanation": "While oil adds some flavour, the main flavour development comes from the Maillard reaction." },
        { "answer": "Because boiling removes all the natural flavour compounds from vegetables", "explanation": "Boiling does not remove all flavour; the difference is that roasting creates new flavour compounds." },
        { "answer": "Because roasted vegetables absorb flavour from the hot air in the oven", "explanation": "Hot air does not contain flavour compounds; the browning reaction creates the flavours." }

    },
    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Why can't the Maillard reaction occur during boiling?",
      "correct": "Because water keeps the temperature at 100°C, below the 140°C needed",
      "correctExplanation": "The Maillard reaction requires temperatures above 140°C and dry conditions. Water boils at 100°C, preventing the food surface from reaching high enough temperatures.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because water blocks the reaction between proteins and sugars in food", "explanation": "Water doesn't block the chemical reaction itself; it's the temperature limitation that matters." },
        { "answer": "Because boiled food has no proteins or sugars for the reaction to occur", "explanation": "Boiled food still contains proteins and sugars; the temperature is simply too low." },

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Why is steaming considered a gentle cooking method even though steam is at 100°C?",
      "correct": "Because the food sits above the water and is not agitated by bubbles",
      "correctExplanation": "In steaming, food doesn't touch turbulent boiling water. The steam transfers heat gently and evenly without the physical agitation of bubbling water.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because steam is actually cooler than 100°C when it reaches the food", "explanation": "Steam from boiling water is at 100°C; the gentleness comes from the lack of agitation, not lower temperature." },
        { "answer": "Because steaming takes less time than any other cooking method available", "explanation": "Steaming is not always faster; its gentleness comes from the cooking process, not speed." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Dry methods preserve all nutrients; wet methods destroy all nutrients", "explanation": "Both methods affect nutrients differently; neither preserves or destroys all nutrients." },

      "correct": "Searing creates flavour through browning; braising converts collagen for tenderness",
      "correctExplanation": "Searing at high heat triggers the Maillard reaction for complex flavours. Braising slowly in liquid converts the shanks' collagen to gelatin for tenderness. Neither step alone achieves both outcomes.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Searing seals in the juices so the meat stays moist during the long braising", "explanation": "This is a common myth. Searing does not seal in juices; it actually causes more moisture loss. Its purpose is flavour." },
        { "answer": "Searing kills bacteria on the surface and braising is just for adding flavour", "explanation": "While searing does kill surface bacteria, its primary purpose is browning for flavour. Braising is for tenderness." },

      "correct": "Steaming retains more nutrients and colour but boiling is simpler and cooks more evenly",
      "correctExplanation": "Steaming preserves water-soluble vitamins and bright colour since food doesn't contact water. Boiling is easier to manage and provides more uniform cooking through full immersion.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Steaming is superior in every way and there is no reason to ever boil vegetables", "explanation": "Boiling has advantages: it's simpler, cooks more uniformly, and is better for some preparations like blanching." },
        { "answer": "Boiling preserves more nutrients than steaming because water protects the vitamins", "explanation": "The opposite is true: water-soluble vitamins dissolve into boiling water and are lost when drained." },

      "correct": "The argument is incorrect because 'wet' refers specifically to water-based cooking mediums",
      "correctExplanation": "In culinary classification, 'wet' or 'moist' specifically means water, stock, or steam. Oil is classified as a dry medium because it is fat-based, not water-based.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The argument is correct because any method where food is submerged in liquid is wet", "explanation": "The classification is based on the type of liquid (water vs fat), not simply whether food is submerged." },
        { "answer": "The argument is correct because oil contains some water molecules within it naturally", "explanation": "While oil may contain trace moisture, it is classified as fat and makes the method dry." },

      "correct": "Poaching keeps the breast moist and tender, while grilling risks drying out this lean cut",
      "correctExplanation": "Chicken breast has little fat or collagen. Poaching at 70-80°C gently cooks it without drying it out, while grilling's high heat can overcook this lean, delicate cut.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Poaching is always faster than grilling for cooking any cut of chicken", "explanation": "Poaching is not necessarily faster; the choice is about texture and moisture, not speed." },

      "correct": "Potatoes are structurally robust with starch; fish has delicate proteins that break apart easily",
      "correctExplanation": "Potatoes contain starch that provides structure during cooking. Fish proteins are delicate and denature at lower temperatures, making them prone to falling apart with aggressive methods.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Potatoes contain more water than fish, which protects them during cooking", "explanation": "Fish actually contains significant water too; the difference is in protein structure and starch content." },
        { "answer": "Fish cannot be cooked at high temperatures because it contains too much fat", "explanation": "Fish can be cooked at high temperatures briefly (e.g., searing); the issue is delicate protein structure." },
        { "answer": "Potatoes are always cooked before eating while fish can be eaten raw instead", "explanation": "While true, this doesn't explain why potatoes handle more cooking methods; it's about structural differences." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Boiling is more environmentally friendly because it uses less energy than steaming", "explanation": "Steaming typically uses less water and similar energy. The nutrient loss from boiling adds to inefficiency." },

      "correctExplanation": "Blanching's short time (30-60 seconds) sets the bright green colour and partially cooks, while the ice bath stops cooking immediately. Full boiling for minutes overcooks and causes nutrient loss.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Blanching uses different water temperature than boiling for cooking the beans", "explanation": "Both use water at 100°C; the difference is the duration and the ice bath to stop cooking." },
        { "answer": "Blanching adds nutrients to the beans while boiling removes them from the beans", "explanation": "Both methods cause some nutrient leaching; blanching minimises it through short exposure time." },
