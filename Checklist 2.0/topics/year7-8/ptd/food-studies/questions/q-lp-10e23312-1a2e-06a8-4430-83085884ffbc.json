    {"type":"mc","question":"What does 'crispy' mean when describing food texture?","correct":"Light and shatters easily when bitten","correctExplanation":"Crispy describes food that is light, thin, and breaks apart easily with a high-pitched cracking sound, like a potato chip.","distractors":[{"answer":"Requires a lot of force to bite through","explanation":"That describes crunchy, not crispy. Crispy food shatters easily because it is light and thin."},{"answer":"Soft and easy to chew for a long time","explanation":"That describes chewy or tender. Crispy food is the opposite — it shatters easily when bitten."},{"answer":"Wet and slippery on the tongue","explanation":"That describes a moist or slimy texture. Crispy food is typically dry and shatters easily."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is the difference between 'crispy' and 'crunchy'?","correct":"Crispy food is light and shatters easily, while crunchy food is firm and requires force to bite through","correctExplanation":"A potato chip is crispy (shatters with a high-pitched sound) while a raw carrot is crunchy (firm, requires force, makes a cracking sound).","distractors":[{"answer":"They mean exactly the same thing with no difference","explanation":"They describe different textures. Crispy is light and shattering; crunchy is firm and requires force."},{"answer":"Crispy means hard while crunchy means soft","explanation":"Neither is exactly hard or soft. Crispy is light and shattering; crunchy is firm with resistance."},{"answer":"Crunchy only applies to vegetables while crispy only applies to snacks","explanation":"Both terms can apply to many foods. The difference is the force required and the type of break."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Which word best describes the texture of a raw carrot?","correct":"Crunchy","correctExplanation":"A raw carrot is crunchy because it is firm and requires force to bite through, producing a cracking sound.","distractors":[{"answer":"Crispy","explanation":"Crispy describes light food that shatters easily, like chips. Carrots are crunchy — firm with resistance."},{"answer":"Chewy","explanation":"Chewy food requires prolonged chewing, like toffee.
