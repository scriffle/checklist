      "correct": "The original had very high sugar, so 25% less still leaves substantial sugar content",
      "correctExplanation": "If the original soft drink had 40g sugar per 100ml, the reduced version would have 30g—still extremely high. The claim is technically valid but the product remains unhealthy.",

      "correctExplanation": "'97% fat free' means 3g fat per 100g, meeting the low fat threshold. If the original had at least 4g per 100g, the 25% reduction is also met, making both claims valid.",

      "correctExplanation": "Peanut butter's fat is predominantly healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. Reducing it removes beneficial fats, and manufacturers often add sugar or starch to maintain taste and texture.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because reduced fat peanut butter contains more peanuts than the regular version", "explanation": "Reduced fat versions typically contain fewer peanuts, not more, as fat comes from the nuts themselves." },
