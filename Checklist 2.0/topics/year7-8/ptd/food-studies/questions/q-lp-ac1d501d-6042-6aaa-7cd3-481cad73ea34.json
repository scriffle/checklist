    { "type": "mc", "question": "Explain why a fried egg can have a firm white but a runny yolk.", "correct": "The white sets at 62-65°C while the yolk needs 65-70°C, so gentle cooking can set the white before the yolk fully coagulates", "correctExplanation": "The different coagulation temperatures mean the white can be fully set while the yolk remains runny if the egg is cooked gently at controlled temperature.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "The white is made of water which evaporates first while the yolk is made of fat that remains liquid longer", "explanation": "Both white and yolk contain proteins that coagulate. The difference is in their coagulation temperatures." }, { "answer": "The frying pan heats unevenly with the edges hotter than the centre where the yolk sits", "explanation": "While pan temperature varies, the key reason is the different coagulation temperatures of white and yolk proteins." }, { "answer": "The white contains more salt which makes it solidify faster than the yolk at any given temperature", "explanation": "Salt content is not the reason. The white and yolk have different protein types with different coagulation temperatures." } ] },

Explain the science behind this result.", "correct": "The white reached 62-65°C and fully coagulated, while the yolk reached 65-70°C but was not held there long enough to fully set", "correctExplanation": "At 6 minutes, the white is fully coagulated. The yolk centre has reached coagulation temperature but insufficient time means it only partially sets, creating a jammy consistency.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "The white and yolk are made of completely different substances that respond differently to identical temperatures", "explanation": "Both contain proteins, but with different coagulation temperatures. Time at temperature is also a factor." }, { "answer": "The shell protects the yolk from heat longer than the white because it is closer to the heat source", "explanation": "The shell surrounds the whole egg. The white sets first because of its lower coagulation temperature." }, { "answer": "Six minutes is the exact time needed to cook the white but the yolk requires at least 20 minutes to set", "explanation": "Yolk does not need 20 minutes. It needs to be held at 65-70°C long enough, which happens in about 10-12 minutes total." } ] },

They over-coagulate and squeeze out water." }, { "answer": "Overcooked scrambled eggs absorb too much oil from the pan creating a greasy rubbery layer", "explanation": "Oil absorption is not the cause. Over-coagulation of proteins causes the rubbery texture." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "Eggs are used as a binding agent in foods like meatballs. Explain why coagulation makes this possible.", "correct": "When heated, egg proteins coagulate and bond with other ingredients, holding the mixture together", "correctExplanation": "Egg proteins spread through the mixture. During cooking, they coagulate and form a network that binds the other ingredients into a cohesive shape.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Eggs act as a glue because their sticky raw texture permanently adheres to other ingredients", "explanation": "Raw egg stickiness is not the binding mechanism. Coagulation during cooking creates the permanent bond." }, { "answer": "Eggs add moisture that prevents the meat from falling apart during the cooking process", "explanation": "Moisture alone does not bind. The coagulation of egg proteins creates a structural network." }, { "answer": "Eggs contain natural adhesive chemicals that activate when mixed with salt and pepper", "explanation": "Binding comes from protein coagulation during heating, not chemical activation by seasonings." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "Why is gentle, low heat recommended when cooking eggs?", "correct": "Gentle heat allows the proteins to coagulate slowly, producing a tender texture without over-tightening", "correctExplanation": "Low heat gives you control over the coagulation process, preventing proteins from over-tightening and squeezing out water, which would create a tough texture.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "High heat destroys all the vitamins in eggs making them nutritionally worthless when consumed", "explanation": "While some nutrients may reduce, the main reason for gentle heat is to control protein coagulation for texture." }, { "answer": "Eggs contain explosive gases that can be released dangerously if heated too quickly in a pan", "explanation": "Eggs do not contain explosive gases. Gentle heat is used for texture control through controlled coagulation." }, { "answer": "Gentle heat is only recommended for aesthetic reasons so that the eggs look more attractive on the plate", "explanation": "While appearance improves, the primary reason is controlling coagulation for tender, not rubbery, texture." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "What are the three main culinary uses of egg coagulation in cooking?", "correct": "Binding, thickening, and coating", "correctExplanation": "Egg coagulation is used to bind ingredients together (meatballs), thicken sauces (custard), and create coatings (crumbed chicken).", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Flavouring, colouring, and preserving", "explanation": "While eggs add colour and flavour, their main functional uses based on coagulation are binding, thickening, and coating." }, { "answer": "Freezing, fermenting, and dehydrating", "explanation": "These are food preservation methods, not culinary uses of egg coagulation." }, { "answer": "Sweetening, acidifying, and carbonating", "explanation": "Eggs do not sweeten, acidify, or carbonate. Their coagulation properties are used for binding, thickening, and coating." } ] },

Explain the role of the egg wash in the crumbing process.", "correct": "The raw egg coats the chicken and coagulates during frying, bonding the breadcrumbs to the meat surface", "correctExplanation": "Raw egg is a liquid coating that adheres breadcrumbs. During frying, the egg proteins coagulate, permanently binding the crumb coating to the chicken.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "The egg adds moisture to prevent the chicken from drying out during the high-heat frying process", "explanation": "While egg adds some moisture, its primary role is as a binding agent through coagulation." }, { "answer": "The egg adds flavour to the breadcrumbs that would otherwise taste bland when fried alone", "explanation": "While egg adds some flavour, its functional role is to bind breadcrumbs through coagulation." }, { "answer": "The egg creates a barrier that prevents oil from entering the chicken during deep-frying", "explanation": "While some barrier effect occurs, the primary role is binding breadcrumbs through coagulation." } ] },

Predict the result.", "correct": "The white will be barely set (soft and custardy) while the yolk remains liquid, since 63°C is just within white coagulation range", "correctExplanation": "At 63°C, egg white is at the beginning of its coagulation range (62-65°C) and will be soft and barely set. The yolk (65-70°C) will not coagulate and remains runny.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Both white and yolk will be completely hard-cooked because 60 minutes is more than enough time at any temperature", "explanation": "Time alone does not fully coagulate proteins. At 63°C, the yolk cannot fully set because it is below its coagulation range." }, { "answer": "The entire egg will remain completely raw because 63°C is too low for any protein coagulation to occur", "explanation": "63°C is within the white's coagulation range (62-65°C).

Explain why a small amount of hot liquid is mixed with the eggs first rather than adding eggs directly to the hot soup.", "correct": "Gradually raising the egg temperature prevents shock coagulation that would create lumps of scrambled egg in the soup", "correctExplanation": "Adding cold eggs directly to hot soup would cause rapid, uneven coagulation, creating scrambled egg lumps. Tempering gradually raises the egg temperature for smooth incorporation.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Mixing hot liquid with eggs first makes the eggs taste better by infusing them with soup flavour before adding", "explanation": "Flavour infusion is not the reason. Tempering prevents lumpy coagulation." }, { "answer": "Tempering is done purely for food safety to ensure the eggs reach a safe temperature before serving", "explanation": "While food safety matters, tempering specifically prevents lumpy coagulation in the soup." }, { "answer": "Eggs must be mixed with liquid first because they cannot be poured directly from the shell into hot soup", "explanation": "Eggs can physically be added directly, but tempering prevents the uneven coagulation that would create lumps." } ] },

The advice is scientifically valid." }, { "answer": "The advice only applies to raw eggs and has no relevance once the egg has started to cook", "explanation": "The advice specifically concerns over-cooking. Continued high heat after coagulation causes degradation." }, { "answer": "The advice is outdated because modern eggs are genetically modified to resist overcooking damage", "explanation": "Egg proteins still behave according to the same coagulation principles regardless of breeding methods." } ] },
