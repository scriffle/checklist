    {"type":"mc","question":"How many basic taste sensations can humans detect?","correct":"Five","correctExplanation":"Humans can detect five basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami.","distractors":[{"answer":"Three","explanation":"There are five basic tastes, not three. Students may only be thinking of sweet, sour, and salty."},{"answer":"Four","explanation":"There are five basic tastes. Umami is often forgotten as it was the most recently identified."},{"answer":"Seven","explanation":"There are five basic tastes. Students may be confusing taste sensations with other sensory categories."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Which basic taste is associated with sugars?","correct":"Sweet","correctExplanation":"Sweet taste is triggered by sugars and signals energy-rich foods.","distractors":[{"answer":"Sour","explanation":"Sour taste is triggered by acids, not sugars. Sweet is the taste associated with sugars."},{"answer":"Umami","explanation":"Umami is triggered by glutamate in protein-rich foods. Sweet taste detects sugars."},{"answer":"Bitter","explanation":"Bitter taste often signals potentially toxic compounds. Sweet taste is the one that detects sugars."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What substance triggers the sour taste sensation?","correct":"Acids","correctExplanation":"Sour taste is caused by acids such as citric acid in lemons and acetic acid in vinegar.","distractors":[{"answer":"Sugars","explanation":"Sugars trigger sweet taste, not sour. Acids are responsible for the sour taste sensation."},{"answer":"Sodium chloride","explanation":"Sodium chloride triggers salty taste. Acids trigger the sour taste sensation."},{"answer":"Glutamate","explanation":"Glutamate triggers umami taste. Sour taste is caused by acids."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is the fifth basic taste called?","correct":"Umami","correctExplanation":"Umami, meaning 'deliciousness' in Japanese, was identified by Dr Kikunae Ikeda in 1908. It is triggered by glutamate and signals protein-rich foods.","distractors":[{"answer":"Spicy","explanation":"Spicy is a pain sensation, not a taste. Umami is the fifth basic taste."},{"answer":"Tangy","explanation":"Tangy describes a flavour quality, not a basic taste. The fifth basic taste is umami."},{"answer":"Savoury","explanation":"While umami is often described as savoury, the correct scientific name for the fifth basic taste is umami."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Which foods are good examples of umami taste?","correct":"Parmesan cheese, tomatoes, and mushrooms","correctExplanation":"These foods are high in glutamate, the compound that triggers umami taste. Vegemite is another Australian example.","distractors":[{"answer":"Lemons, oranges, and grapefruit","explanation":"Citrus fruits are sour due to citric acid. Umami is found in foods like Parmesan, tomatoes, and mushrooms."},{"answer":"Honey, sugar, and chocolate","explanation":"These foods are sweet. Umami taste is found in glutamate-rich foods like Parmesan and tomatoes."},{"answer":"Chips, pretzels, and salted nuts","explanation":"These are primarily salty. Umami is a separate taste found in glutamate-rich foods like Parmesan and mushrooms."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Umami is a basic taste sensation triggered by glutamate in foods like Parmesan cheese and tomatoes.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"Umami is indeed the fifth basic taste, triggered by glutamate found in protein-rich foods like Parmesan, tomatoes, mushrooms, and Vegemite.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Umami is a scientifically recognised basic taste. It was identified in 1908 and is triggered by glutamate."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Spicy is one of the five basic taste sensations.","correct":"False","correctExplanation":"Spicy is not a basic taste. It is a pain/heat sensation detected by pain receptors, not taste receptors. The five basic tastes are sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami.","distractors":[{"answer":"True","explanation":"Spicy is a common misconception. It is actually a pain sensation, not a taste. The five tastes are sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami."}]},

    {"type":"mc","question":"Why does each basic taste serve an evolutionary purpose?","correct":"Each taste helped our ancestors identify nutritious or dangerous foods for survival","correctExplanation":"Sweet signals energy (sugars), umami signals protein, salty signals minerals, sour warns of spoiled food, and bitter warns of potential toxins.","distractors":[{"answer":"Taste exists only for enjoyment and has no survival function","explanation":"Each taste evolved to help identify foods that were safe and nutritious or potentially dangerous."},{"answer":"Taste sensations were randomly assigned to foods with no biological purpose","explanation":"Each taste sensation evolved as a survival mechanism to guide food choices."},{"answer":"Only sweet and bitter have evolutionary purposes; the others developed recently","explanation":"All five basic tastes have evolutionary significance related to identifying nutrients or dangers."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why might bitter taste be associated with detecting potentially toxic compounds?","correct":"Many natural toxins in plants taste bitter, so bitterness evolved as a warning system","correctExplanation":"Plants produce bitter compounds as defence against being eaten. Humans evolved sensitivity to bitterness as a warning to avoid potentially toxic substances.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because all bitter foods are actually poisonous and should never be eaten","explanation":"Not all bitter foods are toxic. Coffee, dark chocolate, and many vegetables are bitter but safe. Bitter taste is a warning, not a guarantee of danger."},{"answer":"Because bitter taste was invented by scientists to classify unpleasant foods","explanation":"Bitter taste is a natural biological response that evolved to detect potentially toxic compounds."},{"answer":"Because bitter is the weakest taste and can only detect strong toxins","explanation":"Bitter is actually one of the most sensitive tastes. Humans can detect very low concentrations of bitter compounds."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How does salty taste help the body?","correct":"It helps detect sodium chloride, which is essential for nerve and muscle function","correctExplanation":"Sodium is essential for nerve impulses and muscle contractions. Salty taste helps us find and consume adequate sodium.","distractors":[{"answer":"Salty taste has no biological function and exists only because we add salt to food","explanation":"Salty taste evolved to detect sodium, an essential mineral. Our preference for salt reflects a genuine biological need."},{"answer":"Salty taste prevents us from ever eating salt because it is always harmful","explanation":"Moderate sodium intake is essential for health. Salty taste helps us find this necessary mineral."},{"answer":"Salty taste only developed after humans learned to mine salt from the ground","explanation":"Salty taste is an ancient sense that predates salt mining. It evolved to detect sodium in natural foods."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is the difference between taste and flavour?","correct":"Taste is detected by the tongue alone, while flavour combines taste with smell, texture, and other senses","correctExplanation":"Taste refers specifically to the five sensations on the tongue. Flavour is the complete experience including smell, texture, temperature, and appearance.","distractors":[{"answer":"Taste and flavour are exactly the same thing with no difference","explanation":"They are different. Taste is limited to the five basic sensations; flavour is the complete multi-sensory experience."},{"answer":"Flavour is detected by the tongue while taste is detected by the nose","explanation":"This is reversed. Taste is the tongue's contribution; flavour includes taste plus smell and other senses."},{"answer":"Taste refers only to sweet things while flavour refers to everything else","explanation":"Taste includes all five sensations on the tongue. Flavour is the broader sensory experience."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why can some people taste bitter compounds like those in broccoli more intensely than others?","correct":"Genetic variation means some people have more bitter taste receptors, making them 'supertasters'","correctExplanation":"About 25% of people are supertasters with extra taste receptors, making them more sensitive to bitter compounds in vegetables and other foods.","distractors":[{"answer":"Everyone tastes bitter exactly the same way; differences are imagined","explanation":"Genetic research has confirmed that people genuinely differ in their ability to taste bitter compounds."},{"answer":"People who dislike broccoli are simply being fussy and have normal taste","explanation":"Supertasters genuinely experience more intense bitterness due to having more taste receptors."},{"answer":"Only adults can taste bitter compounds; children cannot detect them","explanation":"Children are often more sensitive to bitterness than adults, which is why many children dislike bitter vegetables."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why is Vegemite considered a good example of umami taste in Australian culture?","correct":"Vegemite is made from yeast extract, which is very high in glutamate","correctExplanation":"Yeast extract is one of the richest sources of glutamate, making Vegemite an intensely umami food that is iconic in Australian cuisine.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because Vegemite is sweet and Australians call sweet foods umami","explanation":"Vegemite is not sweet. It is salty and strongly umami due to its high glutamate content."},{"answer":"Because Vegemite is the only food in Australia that contains any glutamate","explanation":"Many foods contain glutamate. Vegemite is a particularly concentrated source, making it a clear example."},{"answer":"Because umami was discovered in Australia using Vegemite as the test food","explanation":"Umami was discovered in Japan by Dr Ikeda in 1908 using kombu seaweed. Vegemite is simply a good Australian example."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Sweet taste evolved to help humans identify energy-rich foods containing sugars.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"Sweet taste signals the presence of sugars, which provide energy. This evolutionary adaptation helped our ancestors find calorie-rich foods.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Sweet taste does have an evolutionary purpose. It evolved to help detect sugars as energy sources for survival."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about bitter taste.","sentence":"Bitter taste evolved as a {{blank:1}} system because many natural plant toxins have a bitter taste.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"warning","correctExplanation":"Bitterness serves as a warning that food may contain toxic compounds, helping our ancestors avoid dangerous plants.","distractors":[{"answer":"reward","explanation":"Bitter taste is a warning, not a reward. Sweet taste is the reward signal for energy-rich foods."},{"answer":"cooling","explanation":"Bitterness is not related to temperature. It is a warning system for potentially toxic compounds."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about taste versus flavour.","sentence":"Taste refers to the five basic sensations on the tongue, while {{blank:1}} is the complete experience including taste, smell, and texture.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"flavour","correctExplanation":"Flavour is the holistic sensory experience that combines taste, smell, texture, temperature, and visual appearance.","distractors":[{"answer":"aroma","explanation":"Aroma is just the smell component. Flavour is the complete experience combining taste, smell, and texture."},{"answer":"sweetness","explanation":"Sweetness is just one of the five basic tastes. Flavour is the complete multi-sensory experience."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about supertasters.","sentence":"People called {{blank:1}} have more taste receptors and experience bitter compounds more intensely than average.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"supertasters","correctExplanation":"About 25% of people are supertasters with extra taste receptors, making them more sensitive to bitter and other tastes.","distractors":[{"answer":"non-tasters","explanation":"Non-tasters have fewer taste receptors. Supertasters are the ones with more receptors and greater sensitivity."},{"answer":"foodies","explanation":"Foodie is a casual term for food enthusiasts. Supertaster is the scientific term for people with extra taste receptors."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why children are often more sensitive to bitter tastes than adults.","correct":"Children have more taste buds than adults, making bitter compounds taste more intense, and this sensitivity decreases with age","correctExplanation":"Children have more active taste buds and greater sensitivity to bitterness. This may have evolved to protect young children from accidentally eating toxic plants.","distractors":[{"answer":"Children are simply being difficult about food and their taste perception is identical to adults","explanation":"Research confirms children genuinely taste bitterness more intensely due to higher taste bud density."},{"answer":"Adults have more bitter taste receptors but have learned to ignore them completely","explanation":"Adults actually have fewer active taste buds. The decrease in sensitivity is physiological, not learned."},{"answer":"Children cannot detect bitter taste at all until they reach puberty","explanation":"Children detect bitterness more intensely than adults, not less. Sensitivity decreases with age."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how the food industry uses umami to enhance processed food flavours.","correct":"Adding glutamate-rich ingredients like MSG or yeast extract intensifies savoury flavour without adding as much salt","correctExplanation":"MSG and yeast extract provide umami that enhances overall flavour perception, allowing manufacturers to reduce sodium while maintaining taste satisfaction.","distractors":[{"answer":"The food industry does not use umami in any products","explanation":"Umami ingredients like MSG and yeast extract are widely used in processed foods to enhance flavour."},{"answer":"Umami can only be found in natural foods and cannot be added to processed products","explanation":"Glutamate can be added as MSG or through yeast extract and other umami-rich ingredients."},{"answer":"The food industry uses umami only to make foods taste sweet","explanation":"Umami enhances savoury, not sweet, flavour. It provides depth and satisfaction to savoury foods."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why a cold can make food seem flavourless even though taste receptors still work.","correct":"About 80% of flavour perception comes from smell, which is blocked when the nose is congested","correctExplanation":"While basic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami) are still detected, the loss of smell removes most of the complexity we perceive as flavour.","distractors":[{"answer":"A cold destroys all taste receptors on the tongue permanently","explanation":"Taste receptors are not destroyed by a cold. The loss of flavour comes from blocked smell, not damaged taste buds."},{"answer":"Cold viruses specifically target umami receptors, eliminating all savoury taste","explanation":"Cold viruses block nasal passages, reducing smell. Taste receptors on the tongue still function normally."},{"answer":"Food actually tastes the same during a cold; people only imagine it is different","explanation":"The reduced flavour perception is genuine because congestion blocks the smell component of flavour."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why MSG (monosodium glutamate) is controversial despite being a naturally occurring compound.","correct":"Public misconceptions from the 1960s persist despite scientific evidence showing MSG is safe for most people","correctExplanation":"'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' was proposed in 1968 but subsequent scientific research has not found evidence that MSG causes the reported symptoms in controlled studies.","distractors":[{"answer":"MSG is a dangerous synthetic chemical that has been proven to cause illness","explanation":"MSG is the sodium salt of glutamate, found naturally in many foods. Scientific reviews have not confirmed health risks at normal dietary levels."},{"answer":"MSG controversy exists because it is only found in Chinese food and nowhere else","explanation":"Glutamate is naturally present in many foods including tomatoes, Parmesan, and mushrooms. MSG is used in many cuisines."},{"answer":"There is no controversy about MSG; everyone agrees it is completely safe","explanation":"Public perception remains mixed despite scientific evidence. The controversy continues even though research supports safety."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare how different cultures have developed cuisines that balance the five basic tastes.","correct":"Most cuisines include dishes that balance multiple tastes, such as Thai food combining sweet, sour, salty, and umami","correctExplanation":"Successful cuisines worldwide use combinations of tastes to create satisfying dishes. Thai cuisine is notable for deliberately balancing four or five tastes in many dishes.","distractors":[{"answer":"Each culture only uses one or two basic tastes and ignores the others entirely","explanation":"Most cuisines use multiple tastes. The combination and balance differ, but no cuisine ignores tastes entirely."},{"answer":"Only Asian cuisines use umami; Western cuisines do not include this taste","explanation":"Western cuisines use umami extensively through Parmesan, aged meats, tomato sauce, and other glutamate-rich ingredients."},{"answer":"Taste preferences are identical across all cultures with no variation","explanation":"While the five tastes are universal, cultural preferences for taste combinations and intensities vary significantly."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why humans have far more bitter taste receptors than receptors for any other taste.","correct":"Because detecting a wider range of potentially toxic compounds requires more receptor variety for survival","correctExplanation":"There are about 25 different types of bitter receptors compared to just a few types for other tastes, reflecting the diversity of potential toxins in nature.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because bitter is the most enjoyable taste and the body wants to detect more of it","explanation":"Bitter is often unpleasant. The many receptor types evolved to detect a wide range of potentially toxic compounds."},{"answer":"Humans do not have more bitter receptors; all tastes have equal numbers","explanation":"Humans have approximately 25 types of bitter receptors, far more than for other tastes."},{"answer":"Extra bitter receptors are a recent mutation caused by processed food consumption","explanation":"Bitter receptor diversity is ancient and evolved to detect natural toxins, not in response to modern foods."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how understanding the five basic tastes helps food manufacturers develop successful products.","correct":"Products are designed to balance tastes for maximum palatability, using umami and salt for savoury foods and sweet-sour balance for beverages","correctExplanation":"Food scientists deliberately balance taste profiles using knowledge of how different tastes interact and contribute to overall satisfaction.","distractors":[{"answer":"Food manufacturers ignore taste science and rely only on random recipe testing","explanation":"Modern food development is heavily informed by taste science, including understanding taste interactions and preferences."},{"answer":"Successful products only need one basic taste to be appealing","explanation":"Most successful products balance multiple tastes. Single-taste products are often perceived as unbalanced."},{"answer":"Understanding taste has no commercial application because consumers cannot detect taste differences","explanation":"Consumers are highly sensitive to taste differences, making taste science essential for product development."}]},

    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the claim that umami should not be considered a basic taste because it was only identified in 1908.","correct":"The recency of discovery does not invalidate umami; it has distinct receptors and meets all scientific criteria for a basic taste","correctExplanation":"Umami has dedicated taste receptors, a distinct perception, and universal presence in human taste systems. These scientific criteria define a basic taste regardless of when it was identified.","distractors":[{"answer":"The claim is valid because only tastes known for centuries qualify as basic tastes","explanation":"Scientific classification depends on biological evidence, not historical awareness. Umami meets all criteria for a basic taste."},{"answer":"Umami is actually a combination of salty and sweet rather than a separate taste","explanation":"Umami is mediated by its own specific receptors and produces a distinct sensation that cannot be replicated by combining other tastes."},{"answer":"Umami should be removed from the list because most people cannot taste it","explanation":"All humans have umami receptors. The taste is universal even if people are not always consciously aware of it."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate whether there could be additional undiscovered basic tastes beyond the current five.","correct":"It is scientifically possible; researchers are investigating potential tastes for fat (oleogustus), starch, and calcium","correctExplanation":"Recent research suggests fat may have its own taste receptor system. The five-taste model may expand as new receptor mechanisms are confirmed.","distractors":[{"answer":"It is impossible because five is the maximum number of tastes any species can have","explanation":"The number of basic tastes is an empirical question. New receptors and tastes could be confirmed through research."},{"answer":"All possible tastes were identified thousands of years ago and no new ones can exist","explanation":"Umami was only confirmed in the 20th century. Science continues to investigate potential new taste modalities."},{"answer":"There are actually hundreds of basic tastes that scientists refuse to acknowledge","explanation":"Basic tastes require specific receptors and distinct perceptions. Only candidates with scientific evidence are considered."}]},

This approach is being used in public health strategies worldwide.","distractors":[{"answer":"Understanding taste cannot help with sodium reduction because salt is the only source of flavour","explanation":"Umami provides savoury satisfaction that can partially compensate for reduced salt, helping lower sodium intake."},{"answer":"The solution is to eliminate all salty taste receptors through gene editing","explanation":"Taste receptors serve important biological functions. The practical approach is using umami to reduce the need for salt."},{"answer":"Excessive salt consumption is not a real health issue and requires no solution","explanation":"Excessive sodium intake is a well-documented public health concern linked to hypertension and cardiovascular disease."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the evolutionary hypothesis that disgust responses to bitter foods in children may be maladaptive in modern society.","correct":"While bitterness aversion protected ancestral children from toxins, it now causes rejection of nutritious bitter vegetables","correctExplanation":"In ancestral environments, avoiding bitter plants was protective. In modern society with safe food supplies, this same response leads to rejection of healthy vegetables like broccoli.","distractors":[{"answer":"Children's bitter aversion is still fully adaptive because all bitter vegetables are dangerous","explanation":"Modern bitter vegetables are safe to eat. The ancestral protection response is now counterproductive for nutrition."},{"answer":"Children do not actually have stronger bitter sensitivity than adults","explanation":"Research confirms children have more taste buds and greater bitter sensitivity, which decreases with age."},{"answer":"Evolutionary hypotheses have no relevance to modern eating behaviours","explanation":"Evolutionary biology provides important insights into food preferences that influence modern nutrition challenges."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how artificial sweeteners interact with our evolutionary taste system and evaluate the consequences.","correct":"They activate sweet receptors without providing expected energy, potentially disrupting learned associations between sweetness and calories","correctExplanation":"Our taste system evolved to link sweetness with caloric energy. Artificial sweeteners may confuse this system, though research on long-term effects is ongoing.","distractors":[{"answer":"Artificial sweeteners perfectly replicate sugar's effects on the taste system with no differences","explanation":"Artificial sweeteners activate sweet receptors but do not provide calories, potentially disrupting the evolved sweetness-energy association."},{"answer":"Artificial sweeteners cannot activate taste receptors because they are synthetic","explanation":"Synthetic compounds can activate natural receptors if they have the right molecular shape. This is how artificial sweeteners work."},{"answer":"The evolutionary taste system has no connection to how we respond to modern food products","explanation":"Our evolved taste responses directly influence how we perceive and respond to all foods, including modern products."}]},
