    {"type":"mc","question":"Approximately what percentage of flavour perception comes from smell?","correct":"80%","correctExplanation":"About 80% of what we perceive as 'taste' actually comes from our sense of smell. The tongue detects only the five basic tastes.","distractors":[{"answer":"10%","explanation":"Smell contributes far more than 10%. About 80% of flavour perception comes from smell."},{"answer":"50%","explanation":"While significant, 50% underestimates smell's contribution. About 80% of flavour perception comes from smell."},{"answer":"5%","explanation":"Smell contributes about 80% of flavour perception, far more than 5%."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why does food taste bland when you have a blocked nose from a cold?","correct":"Because you cannot smell the food, and smell provides most of the flavour experience","correctExplanation":"With a blocked nose, aromas cannot reach smell receptors. Since about 80% of flavour comes from smell, food seems flavourless.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because the cold virus destroys taste buds on the tongue","explanation":"Taste buds still function during a cold. The flavour loss is because blocked nasal passages prevent smell."},{"answer":"Because cold medicine removes all ability to taste food","explanation":"While some medicines can affect taste, the main reason is that nasal congestion blocks smell."},{"answer":"Because the cold makes your tongue too dry to detect flavours","explanation":"Tongue dryness is not the main issue. Blocked smell receptors cause the perceived flavour loss."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What are the two pathways by which aromas reach smell receptors?","correct":"Orthonasal (through the nostrils) and retronasal (from the mouth through the back of the throat to the nose)","correctExplanation":"Aromas reach smell receptors through the nostrils when sniffing (orthonasal) and from the mouth during chewing and swallowing (retronasal).","distractors":[{"answer":"Through the ears and eyes","explanation":"Smell receptors are reached through nasal passages, not ears or eyes. The two pathways are orthonasal and retronasal."},{"answer":"Through the skin and hair","explanation":"Aromas reach smell receptors through nasal pathways: orthonasal (nostrils) and retronasal (mouth to nose)."},{"answer":"Through the tongue and teeth","explanation":"While the mouth is involved in the retronasal pathway, the aromas travel from the mouth up to the nose, not through teeth."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is retronasal smell?","correct":"Aromas that travel from the mouth up through the back of the throat to the nose during eating","correctExplanation":"When you chew food, volatile aroma compounds are released and travel up from your mouth through the back of your throat to your nasal cavity.","distractors":[{"answer":"The smell you detect when sniffing food before eating it","explanation":"Sniffing food is orthonasal smell. Retronasal smell occurs during eating, when aromas travel from mouth to nose."},{"answer":"The ability to smell food from a great distance","explanation":"Retronasal smell is not about distance. It is the aroma pathway from the mouth to the nose during eating."},{"answer":"A medical condition where you cannot smell anything","explanation":"Retronasal smell is a normal pathway for detecting aromas during eating, not a medical condition."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Which type of food demonstrates the importance of smell in flavour — coffee or sugar?","correct":"Coffee, because its complex flavour comes largely from hundreds of volatile aroma compounds","correctExplanation":"Coffee's flavour complexity comes from over 800 aroma compounds detected by smell. Sugar has virtually no aroma and is perceived mainly through sweet taste alone.","distractors":[{"answer":"Sugar, because its sweetness depends entirely on smell","explanation":"Sugar's sweetness is detected by taste receptors on the tongue, not by smell. Coffee demonstrates smell's role better."},{"answer":"Both demonstrate smell equally because all foods rely on smell the same amount","explanation":"Foods vary in aroma complexity. Coffee has hundreds of aroma compounds; sugar has virtually none."},{"answer":"Neither, because smell plays no role in food flavour","explanation":"Smell provides about 80% of flavour perception. Coffee's complex flavour is largely aroma-dependent."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"About 80% of what we perceive as taste actually comes from our sense of smell.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"The tongue detects only five basic tastes. The complex flavours we experience come mainly from aroma compounds detected by smell receptors.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Research confirms that approximately 80% of flavour perception is attributed to smell, not taste receptors on the tongue."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Orthonasal smell occurs when aromas travel from the mouth to the nose during eating.","correct":"False","correctExplanation":"Orthonasal smell occurs through the nostrils when sniffing. The pathway from mouth to nose during eating is called retronasal smell.","distractors":[{"answer":"True","explanation":"The mouth-to-nose pathway is retronasal smell. Orthonasal smell is through the nostrils when sniffing."}]},

The tongue only detects the five basic tastes.","distractors":[{"answer":"20","explanation":"20% would be the tongue's contribution. Smell contributes about 80% of flavour perception."},{"answer":"50","explanation":"Smell contributes more than half. About 80% of flavour perception comes from smell."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about why food tastes bland during a cold.","sentence":"Food tastes bland when you have a cold because nasal {{blank:1}} prevents aromas from reaching smell receptors.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"congestion","correctExplanation":"Nasal congestion from a cold blocks the pathways that aromas use to reach smell receptors, dramatically reducing flavour perception.","distractors":[{"answer":"dryness","explanation":"Nasal dryness is not the main issue during a cold. Congestion blocks aroma pathways to smell receptors."},{"answer":"temperature","explanation":"Nasal temperature changes are not the cause. Congestion physically blocks aromas from reaching receptors."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about aroma pathways.","sentence":"The {{blank:1}} pathway carries aromas from the mouth through the back of the throat to the nose during eating.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"retronasal","correctExplanation":"The retronasal pathway allows aromas released during chewing to travel from the mouth up to the nasal cavity for smell detection.","distractors":[{"answer":"orthonasal","explanation":"Orthonasal is the pathway through the nostrils when sniffing. Retronasal is the mouth-to-nose pathway during eating."},{"answer":"gustatory","explanation":"Gustatory refers to taste, not smell. The retronasal pathway carries aromas from mouth to nose."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"Why do wine tasters swirl wine in their glass before tasting?","correct":"Swirling releases volatile aroma compounds, increasing orthonasal smell for more complete flavour assessment","correctExplanation":"Swirling increases the surface area of wine exposed to air, releasing more volatile aroma compounds that can be detected through orthonasal smell when sniffing.","distractors":[{"answer":"To mix the alcohol evenly throughout the wine","explanation":"Wine is already well-mixed. Swirling releases aroma compounds for better smell assessment."},{"answer":"To warm the wine to the correct drinking temperature","explanation":"While temperature affects aroma release, the primary purpose of swirling is to release volatile compounds for smelling."},{"answer":"It is purely a social tradition with no effect on flavour perception","explanation":"Swirling has a genuine scientific purpose: releasing volatile aroma compounds that contribute to flavour assessment."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Explain why chewing food thoroughly enhances flavour perception.","correct":"Chewing releases more volatile aroma compounds from food, increasing retronasal smell","correctExplanation":"Breaking down food through chewing releases trapped aroma molecules. These travel up the retronasal pathway to smell receptors, enriching the flavour experience.","distractors":[{"answer":"Chewing creates new flavour chemicals that did not exist in the food before","explanation":"Chewing does not create new chemicals. It releases existing aroma compounds trapped within the food structure."},{"answer":"Chewing warms the food which is the only factor affecting flavour","explanation":"While warmth helps release aromas, the physical release of trapped aroma compounds through chewing is the primary mechanism."},{"answer":"Chewing has no effect on flavour because all flavour comes from the tongue","explanation":"Chewing enhances flavour by releasing aromas for retronasal smell, which provides about 80% of flavour perception."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why does holding your nose while eating make it harder to tell the difference between foods?","correct":"Without smell, you can only detect the five basic tastes, losing the complex aroma information that distinguishes foods","correctExplanation":"Many foods share similar basic taste profiles but have very different aromas. Without smell, an apple and an onion can be difficult to distinguish.","distractors":[{"answer":"Holding your nose blocks blood flow to the taste buds on your tongue","explanation":"Nose-holding does not affect blood flow to taste buds. It blocks the nasal pathways needed for aroma detection."},{"answer":"Holding your nose makes you breathe through your mouth which enhances taste","explanation":"Mouth breathing does not enhance taste. Blocking the nose prevents aroma detection, reducing flavour."},{"answer":"There is no difference; holding your nose has no effect on food perception","explanation":"Holding your nose demonstrably reduces flavour perception by blocking both orthonasal and retronasal smell pathways."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why is the smell of freshly baked bread so appealing even before you taste it?","correct":"Maillard reaction compounds produce volatile aromas that trigger orthonasal smell, creating flavour expectations before eating","correctExplanation":"The hundreds of aroma compounds from baking reach your nose through orthonasal smell, creating anticipation and activating appetite before tasting.","distractors":[{"answer":"The bread releases taste chemicals that your tongue can detect from a distance","explanation":"Taste requires direct tongue contact. The bread's appeal at a distance comes from aroma compounds detected by orthonasal smell."},{"answer":"The heat from the bread directly stimulates taste receptors in your nose","explanation":"There are no taste receptors in the nose. The appeal comes from volatile aroma compounds reaching smell receptors."},{"answer":"Bread has no smell; the appeal is entirely psychological","explanation":"Freshly baked bread releases many volatile aroma compounds from the Maillard reaction that are genuinely detected by smell."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How does temperature affect the release of aroma compounds from food?","correct":"Higher temperatures increase the release of volatile aromas, which is why hot food often smells and tastes more intense","correctExplanation":"Heat provides energy for volatile compounds to escape from food into the air, where they can reach smell receptors. Cold food releases fewer aromas.","distractors":[{"answer":"Temperature has no effect on aroma release","explanation":"Temperature significantly affects aroma volatility. Hot food releases more aroma compounds than cold food."},{"answer":"Cold food releases more aromas than hot food","explanation":"Hot food releases more volatile aromas because heat energy helps compounds escape into the air."},{"answer":"Temperature only affects taste, not smell","explanation":"Temperature directly affects aroma compound release, which is the primary contributor to flavour through smell."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why might elderly people add more salt to their food?","correct":"Smell sensitivity often decreases with age, reducing flavour perception, so they compensate with stronger tastes like salt","correctExplanation":"Age-related decline in smell sensitivity reduces overall flavour perception. Adding salt boosts the taste component to compensate for reduced aroma detection.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because elderly people prefer salty food for no physiological reason","explanation":"There is a physiological reason: age-related decline in smell sensitivity reduces flavour, leading to compensation with stronger tastes."},{"answer":"Because salt tastes different to elderly people due to tongue changes","explanation":"While some tongue changes occur, the primary driver is reduced smell sensitivity affecting overall flavour perception."},{"answer":"Because elderly people have never learned about the dangers of excess sodium","explanation":"The behaviour is driven by physiological changes in smell sensitivity, not lack of knowledge about sodium."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Hot food generally smells and tastes more intensely than cold food because heat increases the release of volatile aroma compounds.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"Higher temperatures provide more energy for volatile aroma compounds to escape from food, increasing the aromas available for both orthonasal and retronasal detection.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Heat does increase aroma compound volatility. This is why hot food typically has stronger smell and perceived flavour than the same food cold."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about chewing and flavour.","sentence":"Chewing food thoroughly releases more {{blank:1}} aroma compounds that travel via the retronasal pathway to smell receptors.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"volatile","correctExplanation":"Volatile compounds are those that easily become airborne. Chewing releases these trapped molecules so they can reach smell receptors.","distractors":[{"answer":"liquid","explanation":"It is volatile (easily airborne) compounds, not liquid ones, that travel to smell receptors via the retronasal pathway."},{"answer":"solid","explanation":"Solid compounds do not travel to smell receptors. Volatile (airborne) compounds are released by chewing."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about temperature and aroma.","sentence":"Hot food smells more intensely because {{blank:1}} increases the release of volatile aroma compounds into the air.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"heat","correctExplanation":"Heat provides energy for volatile compounds to escape from food, increasing the aromas available for detection.","distractors":[{"answer":"cold","explanation":"Cold reduces aroma release. Heat increases it by providing energy for volatile compounds to become airborne."},{"answer":"pressure","explanation":"While pressure can affect volatility, heat is the primary factor in everyday cooking that increases aroma release."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about age-related flavour changes.","sentence":"Elderly people may add more salt to food because age-related decline in {{blank:1}} sensitivity reduces their overall flavour perception.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"smell","correctExplanation":"Smell sensitivity commonly decreases with age, reducing the 80% of flavour that comes from aroma detection.","distractors":[{"answer":"taste","explanation":"While taste can also decline, the primary driver of age-related flavour loss is the decline in smell sensitivity."},{"answer":"touch","explanation":"Touch sensitivity is not the primary factor. Smell decline is the main cause of reduced flavour perception with age."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why professional food tasters are trained to assess aroma before putting food in their mouth.","correct":"Orthonasal assessment provides initial aroma information separately from retronasal perception, allowing more detailed analysis","correctExplanation":"Assessing orthonasal aroma separately gives tasters a baseline reading of volatile compounds before the more complex retronasal experience during eating.","distractors":[{"answer":"Professional tasters assess aroma first only as a ritual with no analytical purpose","explanation":"Separate orthonasal assessment is a deliberate analytical technique that provides distinct information from retronasal perception."},{"answer":"Tasting food first would destroy the aroma compounds permanently","explanation":"Eating does not destroy aromas. Separate assessment allows more detailed analysis of each sensory pathway."},{"answer":"Professional tasters have different nasal anatomy than normal people","explanation":"Professional tasters have normal anatomy but are trained to use orthonasal and retronasal pathways analytically."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why airline food is often perceived as bland even when prepared by skilled chefs.","correct":"Cabin pressure and low humidity at altitude reduce smell sensitivity by up to 30%, diminishing flavour perception","correctExplanation":"Aircraft cabin conditions dry nasal passages and reduce smell receptor sensitivity, significantly reducing the aroma component of flavour perception.","distractors":[{"answer":"Airlines deliberately make food taste bad to save money on ingredients","explanation":"Airlines invest significantly in food quality. The bland perception is caused by altitude effects on smell sensitivity."},{"answer":"The recycled air in aircraft contains chemicals that destroy all food flavours","explanation":"While cabin air is filtered, the main issue is that reduced pressure and humidity impair smell sensitivity."},{"answer":"Food cannot taste good when consumed in a moving vehicle","explanation":"Motion does not affect taste. The altitude-related reduction in smell sensitivity is the primary factor."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how the food industry uses aroma to influence consumer purchasing decisions.","correct":"Bakeries and cafes use aroma strategically because orthonasal smell creates appetite and desire before any food is tasted","correctExplanation":"The smell of fresh bread or coffee triggers appetite and purchasing impulses through orthonasal smell before consumers even see or taste the food.","distractors":[{"answer":"The food industry does not use aroma as a marketing tool in any way","explanation":"Aroma marketing is widely used in bakeries, supermarkets, and food service to attract customers."},{"answer":"Aroma only affects flavour during eating and cannot influence decisions beforehand","explanation":"Orthonasal smell creates anticipation and appetite that directly influence purchasing decisions."},{"answer":"Consumers make all food choices based on nutrition labels, not aroma","explanation":"While labels matter, aroma significantly influences impulse purchasing and food choice in retail environments."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why smell training is used to help COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell.","correct":"Repeated exposure to specific scents can stimulate recovery of damaged olfactory neurons through neuroplasticity","correctExplanation":"Smell training uses daily exposure to strong scents to encourage regrowth and reconnection of olfactory nerve cells damaged by the virus.","distractors":[{"answer":"Smell training has no scientific basis and is purely a placebo effect","explanation":"Research supports smell training as effective for olfactory recovery. It promotes neuroplasticity in damaged olfactory systems."},{"answer":"COVID-19 does not affect smell, so training is unnecessary","explanation":"Loss of smell (anosmia) is a well-documented COVID-19 symptom. Smell training aids recovery."},{"answer":"Smell training works by replacing nasal cells with artificial sensors","explanation":"Smell training stimulates natural nerve cell recovery, not artificial replacement."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why food scientists create aroma profiles of foods and how this information is used in product development.","correct":"Aroma profiles identify key volatile compounds responsible for a food's characteristic smell, enabling replication or enhancement","correctExplanation":"By identifying which specific compounds create a food's aroma, scientists can replicate flavours artificially or enhance natural aromas in products.","distractors":[{"answer":"Aroma profiles are academic exercises with no practical application in food manufacturing","explanation":"Aroma profiling directly informs flavour replication, product development, and quality control in the food industry."},{"answer":"Aroma profiles only measure colour and texture, not smell","explanation":"Aroma profiles specifically identify volatile compounds responsible for smell, not colour or texture."},{"answer":"All foods have identical aroma profiles so profiling provides no useful information","explanation":"Every food has a unique aroma profile with different combinations of volatile compounds."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare how orthonasal and retronasal smell contribute differently to the eating experience.","correct":"Orthonasal smell creates anticipation before eating; retronasal smell provides the full flavour experience during eating","correctExplanation":"The two pathways serve complementary roles: orthonasal smell helps you evaluate and anticipate food, while retronasal smell integrates with taste during eating.","distractors":[{"answer":"Both pathways contribute identical information and there is no functional difference","explanation":"The two pathways provide different timing and context. Orthonasal precedes eating; retronasal occurs during eating."},{"answer":"Orthonasal is the only pathway that matters; retronasal has no role in flavour","explanation":"Retronasal smell during eating is crucial for the full flavour experience, providing different information from orthonasal smell."},{"answer":"Retronasal smell only detects bad aromas while orthonasal detects good aromas","explanation":"Both pathways detect the full range of aromas. They differ in timing and context, not quality."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why molecular gastronomy chefs create dishes with unexpected aromas to enhance the dining experience.","correct":"Surprising aromas challenge the brain's flavour predictions, creating heightened attention and novel sensory experiences","correctExplanation":"When aroma does not match visual expectations, the brain pays more attention to the sensory experience, potentially enhancing perceived flavour complexity.","distractors":[{"answer":"Unexpected aromas are used purely to confuse diners with no flavour benefit","explanation":"Aroma surprises are deliberate techniques that enhance sensory engagement and perceived flavour complexity."},{"answer":"Molecular gastronomy chefs do not consider aroma in their dish design","explanation":"Aroma is a central element of molecular gastronomy, often manipulated to create novel sensory experiences."},{"answer":"Unexpected aromas always make food taste worse, which is the point of molecular gastronomy","explanation":"Unexpected aromas can enhance the dining experience by creating heightened sensory engagement."}]},
