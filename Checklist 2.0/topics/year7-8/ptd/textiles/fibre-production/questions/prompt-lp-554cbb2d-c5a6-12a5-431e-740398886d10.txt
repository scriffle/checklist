TITLE: I can explain why hemp is considered an environmentally sustainable fibre
CODE: 3.6

WHAT (concept explanation):
Hemp reaches maturity in just 90-120 days (versus cotton's 150-180), requires about 50% less water than cotton, needs no pesticides due to natural pest resistance, and produces 2 times more fibre per hectare than cotton.

WHY (importance):
As sustainability becomes more important in textiles, understanding hemp's environmental advantages helps evaluate claims about eco-friendly fabrics.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Hemp was legalised for food in Australia in November 2017, with about 9,000 hectares cultivated in 2019-2020. Hemp fibre is 3-4 times stronger than cotton. The deep roots prevent erosion and can remove toxins from soil (phytoremediation).

SUBTOPIC: Natural Fibres: Animal and Plant
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers silk production and luxury animal fibres (cashmere, mohair, alpaca, angora), as well as plant fibres including cotton, linen, and hemp. You will learn about production processes, unique properties, and common misconceptions about bamboo fabric.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Natural fibres each have distinct properties that make them suitable for different applications. Understanding their production and characteristics helps you evaluate textile claims and make informed choices about fabric selection.

TOPIC: Fibre Production
SUBJECT: Textiles | YEAR LEVEL: Year 7
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Analyse how fibres are produced in managed environments, from natural sources like wool and cotton to synthetic manufacturing, and evaluate the sustainability challenges facing the textile industry.

# Fibre Production: From Farm and Factory to Fabric

## A Textbook for Year 7-8 Students | Victorian Curriculum VCDSTC046

---

# Welcome to Fibre Production

Look down at what you're wearing right now. Your school uniform, your socks, your jumper—every piece of clothing started as a raw material somewhere in the world. Maybe it was wool from a sheep on an Australian farm, cotton from a plant in Queensland, or polyester made from oil in a factory overseas.

In this unit, you'll discover where textile fibres come from and how they're transformed into the fabrics we wear every day. You'll learn about Australia's important role in global fibre production, how farmers and manufacturers manage their environments to produce quality fibres, and the environmental challenges facing the textile industry.

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to:
- Identify different types of natural and synthetic fibres and their sources
- Explain how fibres are produced in managed environments
- Describe the processing stages that transform raw fibres into textiles
- Analyse the sustainability challenges of different fibre types
- Make informed decisions about textile choices based on their properties and environmental impacts

Let's unravel the story of fibres.

# Chapter 1: Understanding Textile Fibres

## What Is a Fibre?

A **fibre** is a thin, thread-like strand that can be spun into yarn and then woven or knitted into fabric. Fibres are the basic building blocks of all textiles—from the t-shirt on your back to the carpet under your feet.

Fibres can be classified into three main categories based on where they come from:

### 1. Natural Fibres

These come directly from plants or animals and have been used for thousands of years.

**Animal fibres** include:
- Wool (from sheep)
- Silk (from silkworms)
- Alpaca, cashmere, mohair, angora (from various animals)

**Plant fibres** include:
- Cotton (from the cotton plant)
- Linen (from the flax plant)
- Hemp (from the hemp plant)
- Jute, sisal, bamboo

### 2. Synthetic Fibres

These are entirely human-made, usually from petroleum (crude oil) products. They're manufactured in factories through chemical processes.

**Examples include:**
- Polyester
- Nylon
- Acrylic

### 3. Semi-Synthetic (Regenerated) Fibres

These start with a natural material (usually wood pulp) but are chemically processed to create the fibre. They sit between natural and synthetic.

**Examples include:**
- Rayon/Viscose
- Lyocell (TENCEL™)
- Modal

---

## Staple Fibres vs Filament Fibres

Before we dive deeper, there's an important distinction to understand:

**Staple fibres** are short lengths of fibre (from a few centimetres to about 50cm) that must be twisted together (spun) to create a continuous yarn. Most natural fibres are staple fibres—cotton, wool, and linen all come in short pieces that need to be spun.

**Filament fibres** are very long continuous strands. Silk is the only natural filament fibre—a single silk cocoon produces 600-900 metres of unbroken thread! All synthetic fibres are produced as filaments (though they can be cut into staple lengths if desired).

---

## Why Fibre Properties Matter

Different fibres have different properties—characteristics that determine how they behave and what they're best used for. Understanding these properties helps designers and manufacturers choose the right fibre for each purpose.

Key properties include:

| Property | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Absorbency** | How much moisture the fibre can soak up | Affects comfort, drying time, stain resistance |
| **Strength** | How much force needed to break the fibre | Affects durability and wear resistance |
| **Elasticity** | How much it can stretch and return to shape | Affects comfort and shape retention |
| **Thermal properties** | How it conducts or insulates heat | Affects warmth and comfort in different climates |
| **Flammability** | How easily it catches fire | Affects safety, especially for children's wear |
| **Biodegradability** | How quickly it breaks down naturally | Affects environmental impact at end of life |

As we explore each fibre type, pay attention to these properties—they explain why certain fibres are chosen for specific uses.

# Chapter 2: Wool – Australia's Golden Fleece

Australia is one of the world's most important wool-producing nations. We produce about **25% of the world's apparel wool**—that's wool used for clothing rather than carpets. Understanding wool production helps you understand both Australia's agricultural history and how managed environments work.

---

## The Australian Wool Industry

Wool has been central to Australia's economy since the early colonial period. The first Merino sheep arrived in Australia in **1797**, and by **1870**, Australia had become the world's largest wool producer—a position we still hold today.

### Australia's Wool Industry by the Numbers

- **68.5 million sheep** across Australia
- **280 million kg** of greasy (unwashed) wool produced annually
- **99% exported**—mostly to China (82-86% of exports)
- Major wool-producing states: New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia

### The Merino Advantage

While there are many sheep breeds, the **Merino** is the most important for fine wool production. Merino wool is prized for being:
- Very fine (thin fibres)
- Soft against the skin
- Excellent for high-quality clothing

Different Merino strains suit different Australian environments:

| Merino Type | Fibre Fineness | Best Environment |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Saxon Merino | ≤20 microns (very fine) | High-rainfall areas |
| Peppin Merino | 21-22 microns | Wheat-sheep zones |
| South Australian Strongwool | 23-26 microns | Dry pastoral areas |

**What's a micron?** A micron (μm) is one-millionth of a metre. Human hair is about 70 microns thick, while the finest Merino wool can be as thin as 12 microns—so fine you can barely see a single fibre!

---

## From Sheep to Sweater: The Wool Production Process

Wool goes through many stages before it becomes the jumper in your wardrobe. Let's follow the journey:

### Stage 1: Shearing

**Shearing** is the removal of the sheep's fleece. In Australia, this happens once a year, usually in spring after the cold winter months.

Professional shearers use electric handpieces (like heavy-duty hair clippers) to remove the fleece in one piece. A skilled shearer can shear a sheep in just **2-3 minutes** and may shear 150-200 sheep per day.

The average fleece weighs about **4-5 kg**, but this will reduce significantly during processing as impurities are removed.

**Fun fact:** Sheep don't feel pain during shearing—it's like getting a haircut! Their wool grows continuously, so regular shearing is actually necessary for their health and comfort.

### Stage 2: Skirting and Classing

Once removed, the fleece is spread out on a large skirting table. Workers remove the lower-quality wool from the edges (belly wool, leg wool) and any heavily contaminated sections. This is called **skirting**.

A **wool classer** then grades the fleece based on:
- Fibre diameter (micron count)
- Staple length (how long the fibres are)
- Staple strength
- Vegetable matter content (seeds, burrs)
- Colour and condition

Different grades are separated and packed into wool bales (large compressed packages weighing about 180 kg each).

### Stage 3: Wool Auction

Most Australian wool is sold at auction through the **Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX)**. Buyers from around the world (mostly from China) bid on wool bales based on their specifications.

The **Eastern Market Indicator (EMI)** is the benchmark price for Australian wool, typically ranging from 1,100-1,550 cents per kilogram of clean wool.

### Stage 4: Scouring

Raw wool straight from the sheep is called **greasy wool** because it contains:
- **Lanolin** (wool grease/wax)—about 10-25% of the weight
- **Suint** (dried sweat)
- Dirt and dust
- Vegetable matter

**Scouring** is the washing process that removes these impurities. The wool passes through a series of large tanks containing water at **60-65°C** and detergent.

After scouring, the wool loses about **30% of its original weight**—all those impurities are gone! The recovered lanolin is valuable too—it's used in cosmetics and skincare products.

### Stage 5: Carding

**Carding** uses large cylinders covered in fine wire teeth to:
- Separate and untangle the fibres
- Remove any remaining vegetable matter
- Align fibres roughly parallel
- Form fibres into a soft rope called a **sliver**

### Stage 6: Combing (for Worsted Wool)

For the finest wool products, an additional **combing** step removes shorter fibres and makes all remaining fibres lie perfectly parallel. This produces **worsted wool**—used for smooth, fine fabrics like suit material.

Wool that skips this step becomes **woollen yarn**—loftier, softer, and used for things like knitting yarn and blankets.

### Stage 7: Spinning

**Spinning** twists the fibres together to create yarn. The twist holds the fibres in place and gives the yarn its strength.

- More twist = stronger, thinner yarn (good for weaving)
- Less twist = softer, loftier yarn (good for knitwear)

### Stage 8: Fabric Construction

Finally, yarn becomes fabric through either:
- **Weaving**: Interlacing two sets of yarns (warp and weft) at right angles on a loom
- **Knitting**: Interlocking loops of yarn together

---

## What Makes Wool Special?

Wool has some remarkable properties that make it valuable for certain uses:

### Moisture Management

Wool can absorb **30-35% of its own weight in moisture** without feeling wet to the touch. This is because wool fibres have a complex structure with a water-resistant outer layer and an absorbent inner core.

**Why this matters:** Wool clothing keeps you comfortable by absorbing sweat and releasing it slowly into the air. This is why wool is popular for activewear and outdoor clothing.

### Temperature Regulation

The natural **crimp** (waviness) in wool fibres creates millions of tiny air pockets. Air is an excellent insulator, so these pockets trap warmth in cold weather.

But wool also helps in warm weather—as moisture evaporates from wool, it creates a cooling effect.

**Why this matters:** Wool keeps you warm when it's cold and helps regulate temperature when it's warm. This is why Merino wool base layers are popular with hikers and athletes.

### Fire Resistance

Wool is naturally **fire-resistant**. It won't ignite until it reaches **570-600°C** (compare this to cotton, which ignites at just 255°C). Even more importantly, wool requires **25.2% oxygen** to burn, but our atmosphere only contains 21% oxygen—so wool struggles to sustain a flame.

When wool does burn, it tends to smoulder and self-extinguish rather than producing flames. It doesn't melt or drip like synthetic fibres.

**Why this matters:** Wool is used for aircraft seat covers, firefighter uniforms, and children's sleepwear because of its safety properties.

### Elasticity

Wool fibres can stretch up to **30% of their length** and spring back to their original shape. This natural elasticity helps wool garments resist wrinkling and maintain their shape.

### Natural Odour Resistance

The structure of wool fibres resists bacterial growth, meaning wool clothing stays fresher for longer between washes.

---

## Wool Quality and Grading

The value of wool depends primarily on its **micron count**—the diameter of the fibres measured in microns.

| Grade | Micron Range | Typical Use | Relative Value |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Ultrafine | <15.5 | Luxury fashion, next-to-skin | Highest |
| Superfine | 15.6-18.5 | High-end apparel | Very high |
| Fine | 18.6-20.5 | Quality suiting, knitwear | High |
| Medium | 20.6-23.5 | Outerwear, blankets | Medium |
| Strong/Broad | >23.5 | Carpets, industrial | Lower |

**Why finer is more valuable:** Finer fibres feel softer against the skin, drape better, and can be woven into lighter, more luxurious fabrics.

---

## The Woolmark System

You may have seen the **Woolmark** logo on clothing labels—a stylised ball of yarn that's one of the world's most recognised textile symbols.

Created in **1964**, the Woolmark is a certification system owned by **The Woolmark Company** (part of Australian Wool Innovation). Products must pass strict testing to carry the logo:

| Logo | Requirements |
|------|--------------|
| **Woolmark** | 100% pure new wool |
| **Woolmark Blend** | 50-99.9% new wool |
| **Wool Blend** | 30-49.9% new wool |

Products are tested for fibre content, colourfastness (colour doesn't fade), physical strength, and wash performance.

# Chapter 3: Other Animal Fibres

While wool dominates animal fibre production, several other animals provide valuable fibres with unique properties.

---

## Silk: Nature's Only Filament Fibre

Silk is one of the most luxurious and fascinating fibres in the world. It's the only natural fibre that comes as a continuous filament rather than short staple lengths.

### The Silkworm Lifecycle

Silk comes from the cocoon of the **Bombyx mori**—the domesticated silkworm (actually a caterpillar, not a worm!). The production of silk is called **sericulture**, and it follows a precise lifecycle:

**Stage 1: Egg (10-14 days)**
Female silk moths lay 300-500 tiny eggs, each about the size of a pinhead. The eggs are kept at controlled temperatures until they hatch.

**Stage 2: Larva/Caterpillar (23-28 days)**
The newly hatched silkworm is tiny—about 3mm long. Over the next month, it does nothing but eat mulberry leaves. And eat. And eat some more.

During this stage, the silkworm grows to **10,000 times its original size**—imagine if a human baby grew that much! It moults (sheds its skin) four times as it outgrows each skin.

**Stage 3: Cocoon Spinning (2-3 days)**
When fully grown (about 7.5cm long), the silkworm stops eating and begins spinning its cocoon. Moving its head in a figure-8 pattern, it produces a continuous silk filament from glands near its mouth.

A single silkworm produces **600-900 metres** of continuous silk thread in just 2-3 days!

**Stage 4: Pupa (2-3 weeks)**
Inside the cocoon, the silkworm transforms into a moth through metamorphosis.

### Harvesting Silk

Here's where silk production becomes controversial: to harvest the silk as one continuous filament, the cocoons must be collected **before the moth emerges**. If the moth breaks through the cocoon, it breaks the continuous filament into many short pieces, making the silk much less valuable.

Traditional silk production involves killing the pupa inside by:
- Heating the cocoons (sun-drying or steam)
- This also softens the **sericin** (silk gum) holding the filament together

The silk is then **reeled**—the filament from several cocoons (usually 4-8) is combined and wound together to create a usable thread.

**Scale of production:** It takes approximately **3,000 cocoons** to produce just 1 kg of silk, and **104 kg of mulberry leaves** to feed those silkworms!

### Silk Properties

Silk is prized for its:
- **Lustrous appearance**—it reflects light beautifully
- **Incredible strength**—stronger than steel of the same diameter
- **Excellent drape**—flows and hangs elegantly
- **Temperature regulation**—cool in summer, warm in winter
- **Hypoallergenic** qualities—good for sensitive skin

### Peace Silk (Ahimsa Silk)

Some producers now make **peace silk** or **Ahimsa silk**, which allows the moth to emerge naturally before harvesting the cocoon. This produces shorter fibres that must be spun like other staple fibres, resulting in a slightly different texture.

---

## Luxury Animal Fibres

### Cashmere

**Source:** The soft undercoat of cashmere goats, primarily from Mongolia, China, and Iran.

**What makes it special:** To be classified as cashmere, fibres must be **less than 19 microns** in diameter—even finer than most Merino wool. This extreme fineness gives cashmere its legendary softness.

**Production challenges:** Each goat produces only **150-200 grams** of cashmere per year (compared to 4-5 kg of wool per sheep). This scarcity, combined with the hand-combing required to collect it, makes cashmere expensive.

### Mohair

**Source:** The Angora goat (not to be confused with Angora fibre, which comes from rabbits!).

**What makes it special:** Mohair has exceptional lustre (shine), durability, and takes dye brilliantly. It's often blended with wool to add sheen and strength.

**Production:** Each Angora goat produces **3.6-7.3 kg** of mohair per year.

### Alpaca

**Source:** Alpacas, members of the camelid family native to South America. Australia now has a growing alpaca industry.

**What makes it special:** Alpaca fibre is **3-7 times warmer than sheep's wool** because the fibres are partially hollow, trapping more air. It also contains no lanolin, making it naturally hypoallergenic.

**Production:** Each alpaca produces **3-7 kg** of fibre per year.

### Angora

**Source:** Angora rabbits (remember: Angora rabbits give angora; Angora goats give mohair!).

**What makes it special:** Angora is **6 times warmer than wool** due to its hollow fibre structure. It's incredibly soft and lightweight.

**Production challenges:** Each rabbit produces only about **400 grams** per year, and the fibre must be carefully harvested by combing or shearing.

---

## Common Confusion Alert!

Students often confuse these terms:

| Term | Source Animal | Key Fact |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Angora** | Angora RABBIT | 6× warmer than wool |
| **Mohair** | Angora GOAT | High lustre, durable |

Remember: The fibre name and animal name don't always match!

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. Why is silk called a "filament fibre" while wool is a "staple fibre"?
2. How long is the silk filament from a single cocoon?
3. Why must silk cocoons be harvested before the moth emerges?
4. What is the maximum micron count for a fibre to be called cashmere?
5. Which animal does angora fibre come from? Which animal does mohair come from?

---

# Chapter 4: Plant Fibres

Plant fibres have been used for textiles for thousands of years. Cotton is by far the most important, but linen, hemp, and other fibres each have their own story and unique properties.

---

## Cotton: The World's Most Popular Natural Fibre

Cotton is everywhere. Look at the labels in your clothes—chances are most of them contain at least some cotton. Globally, cotton accounts for about **25% of all fibre production**.

### Australia's Cotton Industry

Australia is a significant cotton producer, with a unique story:

- **91% of Australian cotton** is grown in the Murray-Darling Basin (NSW and Queensland)
- Australia produces **4.4-5.5 million bales** annually (depending on water availability)
- Our yields are approximately **3 times the world average** due to advanced farming practices
- **Over 99%** of Australian cotton is exported, mainly to Southeast Asian textile mills

### How Cotton Grows

Cotton comes from plants in the genus *Gossypium*. The cotton "fibre" is actually the protective fluff surrounding the seeds inside the cotton boll (seed pod).

**The growing cycle (150-180 days):**

1. **Planting** (September-November in Australia)
   - Seeds need soil temperature of at least 15°C to germinate
   - Each seed produces a single plant

2. **Vegetative growth** (first 5-6 weeks)
   - Plants develop stems and leaves
   - Roots grow deep to access water

3. **Square formation** (~5 weeks after planting)
   - "Squares" are the flower buds
   - Plants begin reproductive phase

4. **Flowering** (~8 weeks after planting)
   - Flowers open white/cream coloured
   - After pollination, they turn pink then red
   - Each flower produces one boll

5. **Boll development** (50-55 days after flowering)
   - Inside each boll, 32-40 seeds develop
   - Each seed grows thousands of fibres
   - Fibres are almost pure cellulose (plant material)

6. **Boll opening** (maturity)
   - Bolls dry and split open, revealing white cotton
   - A healthy plant may have 100-120 bolls
   - Each boll contains about 500,000 individual fibres!

7. **Harvest** (March-May in Australia)
   - Defoliants remove leaves to ease picking
   - Mechanical harvesters collect the cotton
   - "Seed cotton" includes fibres, seeds, and trash

### Processing: From Field to Fibre

**Ginning** is the critical first step—separating the cotton fibres from the seeds.

When seed cotton enters the gin:
- **35-42%** becomes lint (the usable fibre)
- **48-55%** is cottonseed (used for oil and animal feed)
- **3-10%** is trash and waste

The lint is then compressed into bales weighing about 227 kg each.

**Subsequent processing** follows similar steps to wool:
1. **Opening and cleaning**—loosening compressed bales, removing remaining debris
2. **Carding**—aligning fibres into a sliver
3. **Combing** (optional)—for finer cotton, removes short fibres
4. **Drawing**—combines and stretches slivers for uniformity
5. **Spinning**—twists fibres into yarn
6. **Weaving or knitting**—creates fabric

### Cotton's Unique Properties

Cotton has some properties that make it ideal for everyday clothing:

**Absorbency:** Cotton can absorb **24-27 times its own weight** in water. This makes it comfortable to wear because it absorbs sweat from your skin.

**Strength when wet:** Here's something surprising—unlike most fibres, cotton actually gets **STRONGER when wet**, increasing in strength by **20-25%**. This is why cotton can withstand repeated washing without falling apart.

**Why does cotton get stronger wet?** Water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the cellulose in cotton fibres, actually helping hold them together more tightly!

**Breathability:** Cotton's structure allows air to circulate, keeping you cool.

**Biodegradability:** As a natural cellulose fibre, cotton breaks down relatively quickly—**1 week to 5 months** depending on conditions.

**Drawbacks:** Cotton wrinkles easily, dries slowly, and can shrink when washed.

---

## Linen: Ancient Luxury

Linen is made from the fibres of the **flax plant** (*Linum usitatissimum*). It's one of the oldest textile fibres—evidence of linen fabric dates back over 30,000 years!

### Why Australia Doesn't Grow Flax

Australia has no significant linen production because flax needs:
- Cool, moist climates
- Specific soil conditions
- Labour-intensive harvesting

Most linen comes from Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe.

### The Retting Process

The key step in linen production is **retting**—using controlled bacterial decomposition to break down the pectin (plant glue) that binds fibres to the woody stem.

**Dew retting:** Flax stalks are spread in fields for about 3 weeks. Morning dew and bacteria gradually break down the pectin. This produces silver/grey coloured fibres.

**Water retting:** Stalks are submerged in water for 10-30 days. Faster and more controlled, but requires careful monitoring—over-retting damages the fibres; under-retting makes them impossible to separate.

After retting:
- **Scutching** beats the stalks to remove woody pieces
- **Hackling** combs out the fibres and separates long "line" fibres from short "tow" fibres

### Linen Properties

Linen is valued for:

**Exceptional strength:** Linen is **2-3 times stronger than cotton** and one of the strongest natural fibres available.

**Durability:** Linen products can last **up to 30 years** with proper care—the fibres actually get softer and more comfortable with age and washing.

**Cool comfort:** Linen conducts heat very well, carrying warmth away from your body. This is why linen clothing feels so cool in summer.

**Quick drying:** Linen absorbs moisture well but releases it quickly.

**Sustainability:** Linen is highly biodegradable—it can break down in just a **few weeks** when buried in soil.

**Drawbacks:** Linen wrinkles easily (those wrinkles are considered part of its character!), is more expensive than cotton, and has limited elasticity.

---

## Hemp: The Sustainable Superstar

Hemp (*Cannabis sativa*) is gaining attention as one of the most sustainable fibre options available. Don't worry—industrial hemp is not the same as marijuana, even though they're related plants.

### Hemp in Australia

Hemp farming has a complicated history in Australia due to its relationship with cannabis. However, industrial hemp (which contains less than **0.35-1% THC** depending on state regulations) was legalised for food in **November 2017**, and fibre production is regulated by each state.

About **9,000 hectares** were cultivated in Australia in 2019-2020, with growing interest from farmers and textile companies.

### Why Hemp Is Considered Sustainable

Hemp has remarkable environmental credentials:

**Fast growth:** Hemp reaches maturity in just **90-120 days** (compare to cotton's 150-180 days).

**Low water needs:** Hemp requires about **50% less water** than cotton.

**No pesticides needed:** Hemp naturally resists most pests and diseases.

**High yield:** Hemp produces **2 times more fibre per hectare** than cotton.

**Soil improvement:** Hemp's deep roots prevent erosion and can even help remove toxins from contaminated soil (a process called phytoremediation).

**Carbon capture:** Hemp absorbs large amounts of CO₂ as it grows.

### Hemp Fibre Properties

Hemp produces some of the strongest natural fibres available:

- **3-4 times stronger than cotton**
- Excellent durability and abrasion resistance
- Gets softer with washing
- Naturally resistant to mould and UV light
- Highly breathable
- Biodegradable

**Drawbacks:** Hemp processing is labour-intensive, the fabric can feel rough initially, and limited processing infrastructure currently exists in Australia.

## The Bamboo Misconception

You've probably seen "bamboo" clothing advertised as natural and eco-friendly. Here's something important you need to know:

**Most "bamboo fabric" is actually rayon/viscose made FROM bamboo—not actual bamboo fibre.**

### What's Really Happening

True bamboo linen—made by mechanically processing bamboo stalks—does exist but is:
- Rare
- Rough in texture
- Expensive to produce

The soft "bamboo" clothing commonly sold in stores is made by:
1. Dissolving bamboo pulp in harsh chemicals (sodium hydroxide, carbon disulfide)
2. Extruding the solution through spinnerets to create fibres
3. The result is rayon/viscose—a semi-synthetic fibre

**The problem:** After this chemical processing, **no trace of the original bamboo properties remains**. The resulting fibre is chemically identical to rayon made from any other plant source.

The US Federal Trade Commission requires such products to be labelled as "rayon made from bamboo" rather than simply "bamboo."

**Why this matters:** Some companies market bamboo rayon as "eco-friendly" because bamboo grows quickly without pesticides. However, the chemical processing involved can be highly polluting, potentially cancelling out those environmental benefits.

# Chapter 5: Synthetic Fibres

Synthetic fibres are entirely human-made, typically from petroleum (crude oil) products. They've revolutionised the textile industry since their invention in the 20th century, offering properties that natural fibres can't match.

---

## How Synthetic Fibres Are Made

All synthetic fibres are created through a similar basic process:

1. **Polymerisation:** Chemicals derived from petroleum are reacted together to form long-chain molecules called polymers.

2. **Melting or dissolving:** The polymer is melted or dissolved into a thick, syrup-like liquid.

3. **Extrusion:** The liquid is forced through a **spinneret**—a metal plate with tiny holes (like a showerhead, but with holes just 0.05-0.1mm in diameter).

4. **Solidification:** The fibres solidify as they emerge from the spinneret (by cooling, evaporation, or chemical reaction).

5. **Drawing:** The fibres are stretched to align the polymer molecules, increasing strength.

6. **Texturising (optional):** Fibres can be crimped, curled, or otherwise modified to change their properties.

The shape of the spinneret holes determines the fibre's cross-section:
- Round holes → standard fibres
- Triangular holes → fibres with enhanced lustre
- Hollow centres → fibres with better insulation

Because synthetic fibres are manufactured, their properties can be precisely controlled by adjusting the chemicals used, hole shapes, and processing conditions.

---

## Polyester: The Dominant Fibre

Polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, or PET) is the most widely used fibre in the world, accounting for about **57% of global fibre production**.

### How Polyester Is Made

Polyester production uses **melt spinning** at high temperatures (**260-270°C**):

1. Chemicals react at 150-210°C to form polyester polymer
2. Molten polyester is extruded, cooled, and cut into small chips
3. Chips are remelted to a syrup-like consistency
4. The liquid is forced through spinneret holes
5. Emerging fibres are cooled by air
6. Fibres are stretched **up to 5 times** their original length to align molecules

### Polyester Properties

**Advantages:**
- Very low moisture absorption (**0.4-1%**)—dries quickly
- Wrinkle resistant—holds its shape well
- Strong and durable
- Resistant to stretching and shrinking
- Easy to care for (machine washable, quick drying)
- Takes colour well
- Inexpensive to produce

**Disadvantages:**
- Not breathable—can feel hot and clammy
- Can hold body odours
- Static electricity buildup
- Derived from non-renewable petroleum
- **Non-biodegradable: takes 20-200 years to decompose**
- Releases microplastic fibres when washed

### Recycled Polyester (rPET)

Polyester can be made from recycled plastic bottles (PET bottles). This **recycled polyester (rPET)** offers significant environmental benefits:
- Reduces plastic waste going to landfill
- Uses **59-79% less energy** than virgin polyester
- Produces fewer carbon emissions

**However, there's a catch:** Research shows that recycled polyester may actually release **more microplastic fibres** during washing than virgin polyester, because the recycled fibres are often shorter and weaker.

## Nylon: The First Synthetic Fibre

Nylon holds a special place in textile history as the **first fully synthetic fibre**. It was invented on **February 28, 1935** by Wallace Carothers at DuPont in the USA.

When nylon stockings went on sale in 1940, they caused a sensation—stores sold out within hours, and "nylon riots" occurred as women fought to buy them!

### Nylon Properties

- **Extremely strong:** Stronger than steel of the same diameter
- **Excellent elasticity:** Stretches and recovers well
- **Abrasion resistant:** Stands up to friction and wear
- **Lightweight:** Despite its strength
- **Quick drying:** Low moisture absorption
- **Smooth:** Soft feel against skin

**Disadvantages:**
- Can feel hot in warm weather
- Sensitive to UV light (degrades in sunlight)
- Static buildup
- Made from petroleum
- Takes **30-40 years** to decompose

### Common Uses

Nylon's strength and elasticity make it ideal for:
- Hosiery (stockings, tights)
- Activewear and swimwear
- Parachutes
- Ropes and fishing nets
- Toothbrush bristles
- Carpet fibres

---

## Acrylic: The Wool Substitute

Acrylic was developed as a cheaper alternative to wool. By definition, acrylic fibres contain at least **85% acrylonitrile** (a petroleum-derived chemical).

### Acrylic Properties

**Advantages:**
- Wool-like warmth and softness
- Lightweight
- Resistant to moths (unlike wool)
- Holds colour well
- Relatively inexpensive
- Machine washable

**Disadvantages:**
- Pills easily (forms little balls on the surface)
- Not as warm as real wool
- Static buildup
- Not breathable
- Non-biodegradable (takes **~200 years** to decompose)
- **Releases the most microplastic fibres of any synthetic**

### The Microplastic Problem

Acrylic has a significant environmental issue: it releases approximately **730,000 microplastic fibres per wash**—about **5 times more** than polyester-cotton blends.

These tiny plastic particles are too small for washing machine filters to catch, so they flow into waterways and eventually the ocean.

---

## The Semi-Synthetic Category: Rayon and Lyocell

Some fibres don't fit neatly into "natural" or "synthetic" categories. **Rayon** (also called viscose) and **lyocell** are made from natural materials (wood pulp) but through chemical processing. They're called **semi-synthetic** or **regenerated cellulose** fibres.

### Traditional Viscose/Rayon

Viscose was developed in the late 1800s as a cheaper alternative to silk. The process:

1. Wood pulp (usually from eucalyptus, beech, or pine) is treated with **17.5% sodium hydroxide** (caustic soda)
2. The mixture is reacted with **carbon disulfide** (a toxic chemical)
3. The resulting "viscose" solution is extruded through spinnerets into a **sulfuric acid bath**
4. The cellulose regenerates as solid fibres

**The problem:** This process uses toxic chemicals and produces significant pollution. Carbon disulfide is hazardous to workers and the environment.

### Lyocell (TENCEL™): The Cleaner Alternative

Lyocell (branded as TENCEL™ by Lenzing) uses a much more sustainable **closed-loop process**:

1. Wood pulp is dissolved in a non-toxic solvent called NMMO
2. The solution is extruded through spinnerets
3. **99.8% of the solvent is recovered and recycled**
4. Much less water and energy are used

Lyocell fibres are:
- Strong (stronger than cotton when wet)
- Breathable
- Soft and smooth
- Biodegradable (**55 days** in soil)
- More sustainable than viscose

## Comparing Synthetic Fibres

| Fibre | Made From | Key Property | Decomposition Time |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Polyester | Petroleum | Quick-drying, wrinkle-resistant | 20-200 years |
| Nylon | Petroleum | Extremely strong, elastic | 30-40 years |
| Acrylic | Petroleum | Wool-like warmth | ~200 years |
| Rayon/Viscose | Wood pulp | Silk-like drape | Months-years |
| Lyocell | Wood pulp | Strong, sustainable | ~55 days |

# Chapter 6: Managed Environments for Fibre Production

The Victorian Curriculum asks you to understand how fibres are produced in **managed environments**. But what exactly does this mean?

---

## What Is a Managed Environment?

A **managed environment** is a production system where humans control key factors to optimise outcomes. In fibre production, this includes:

- **Selecting breeds/varieties** suited to local conditions
- **Controlling inputs** (water, nutrients, pest management)
- **Managing timing** (planting, harvesting)
- **Using technology** to monitor and improve production
- **Applying quality standards** throughout the process

Managed environments exist on a spectrum—from extensive sheep stations where management is relatively light-touch, to intensive cotton farms with precise irrigation control, to factory settings for synthetic fibre production.

---

## Managed Environments: Wool Production

Australian sheep stations represent managed grazing environments. Key management practices include:

### Breed Selection

Farmers choose sheep breeds suited to their specific conditions:
- Fine-wool Merinos for higher-rainfall areas
- Stronger-wool breeds for harsh pastoral zones
- Crossbreeds for dual-purpose (wool and meat) production

### Pasture Management

- **Rotational grazing:** Moving sheep between paddocks to allow pastures to recover
- **Stocking rates:** Adjusting sheep numbers based on available feed
- **Supplementary feeding:** Providing additional nutrition during drought or when pastures are poor

### Water Management

- Installing bores (wells) and dams
- Creating watering points throughout properties
- Managing water distribution during dry periods

### Health Management

- Vaccination programs
- Parasite control (drenching)
- Shearing timing for animal welfare
- Managing flystrike (a significant welfare and economic issue)

### Technology Integration

Modern wool production increasingly uses:
- GPS tracking of livestock
- Drones for monitoring pastures and animals
- Weather stations for decision-making
- Digital platforms like WoolClip for recording fleece specifications

---

## Managed Environments: Cotton Production

Cotton farming involves more intensive management than wool production:

### Climate Requirements

Cotton needs:
- Long, hot growing season (150+ frost-free days)
- Minimum soil temperature of 15°C for germination
- Adequate water during key growth stages
- Dry conditions for harvest

In Australia, this limits cotton production primarily to northern NSW and Queensland.

### Water Management

Water is the critical management factor for Australian cotton. Methods include:

**Furrow irrigation:** Water flows down channels between crop rows
**Centre-pivot irrigation:** Rotating sprinkler systems
**Drip irrigation:** Water delivered directly to plant roots (most efficient)

Cotton farms typically use **6-8 megalitres per hectare** per season. The industry has improved water-use efficiency by about **40% since 1992** through better management and technology.

### Pest Management

Cotton plants are vulnerable to many pests. Australian cotton farmers use **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:

- **Monitoring:** Regular scouting and trapping to track pest populations
- **Biological control:** Encouraging beneficial insects that eat pests
- **Genetic resistance:** Planting varieties with built-in pest resistance
- **Targeted spraying:** Using pesticides only when necessary and in specific areas

### Harvest Timing

Getting harvest timing right is crucial:
- Too early: Immature fibres reduce quality
- Too late: Weather damage, increased trash
- Defoliation: Chemical removal of leaves 2-3 weeks before picking to ease mechanical harvest

### Quality Assurance: myBMP

Cotton Australia runs the **myBMP (Best Management Practices)** program. Certified farms must meet **over 300 criteria** covering:
- Water management
- Pest management
- Soil health
- Employee safety
- Environmental protection

About **30%** of Australian cotton is fully certified under this program.

---

## Managed Environments: Synthetic Fibre Production

Factory production represents the most controlled managed environment:

### Controlled Conditions

Synthetic fibre factories maintain precise control over:
- **Temperature:** Specific temperatures for each production stage
- **Chemical concentrations:** Exact formulations for consistent results
- **Air quality:** Clean room conditions for some processes
- **Humidity:** Affects fibre properties during formation

### Quality Control

Modern synthetic fibre production includes:
- Continuous monitoring of fibre diameter
- Testing of tensile strength
- Colour consistency measurement
- Detection of defects

### Automation

Most synthetic fibre production is highly automated:
- Computer-controlled processes
- Minimal human intervention
- Consistent output quality
- 24/7 operation capability

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. What five factors make an environment "managed"?
2. How do wool farmers manage their pastures sustainably?
3. Why is water management so critical for Australian cotton production?
4. What is Integrated Pest Management (IPM)?
5. How does a synthetic fibre factory differ from a sheep station in terms of environmental control?

---

# Chapter 7: Sustainability in Fibre Production

Every fibre—whether natural or synthetic—has environmental impacts. Understanding these impacts helps you make informed choices as a consumer and evaluate claims about "sustainable" textiles.

---

## Water Footprint

Different fibres require vastly different amounts of water to produce:

| Fibre | Water Use (litres per kg) | Context |
|-------|---------------------------|---------|
| Conventional cotton | 8,000-20,000 | One t-shirt ≈ 2,700 litres |
| Organic cotton | 243-2,000 | Up to 91% reduction |
| Hemp | 2,000-3,400 | ~50% less than conventional cotton |
| Linen | ~6,000 | Flax needs less irrigation |
| Wool | 500-800 | Plus processing water |
| Polyester | 60-100 | But uses petroleum instead |

**Important context about cotton:** The often-quoted figure of 10,000-20,000 litres per kg includes **all water** the cotton plant uses—including rainfall. About **73-75%** of cotton's water footprint comes from rain that would fall anyway, not irrigation.

Australian cotton is relatively efficient, producing more fibre per megalitre of irrigation water than most other countries due to advanced farming practices.

---

## Carbon Footprint

All fibre production generates greenhouse gas emissions:

### Natural Fibre Emissions

**Wool:** Surprisingly, wool has a relatively high carbon footprint of **19-25 kg CO₂e per kg** of fibre. About **50%** of this comes from sheep belching methane (yes, really!). Sheep produce approximately **30 litres of methane per day** through their digestive process.

**Cotton:** About **5.34 kg CO₂e per kg**—lower than wool, mainly from farming operations, fertiliser production, and processing.

### Synthetic Fibre Emissions

**Polyester:** About **5.5-9.5 kg CO₂e per kg** from petroleum extraction, chemical processing, and manufacturing.

**Recycled polyester:** **79% lower** emissions than virgin polyester because it uses existing plastic rather than extracting new petroleum.

---

## Pesticide Use

Cotton has historically been called "the world's dirtiest crop" because it uses a disproportionate amount of pesticides:

- Cotton uses approximately **6% of the world's pesticides**
- But cotton only covers about **2.4% of global cropland**
- Pesticides can pollute waterways and harm beneficial insects

**However, the Australian situation is different:**
- Australian cotton uses far fewer pesticides than the global average
- Genetically modified cotton varieties (about 99% of Australian cotton) have built-in pest resistance
- Integrated Pest Management has significantly reduced chemical use
- The myBMP program requires responsible pesticide use

**Organic cotton** uses no synthetic pesticides but may require more water and land to produce the same amount of fibre.

---

## Microplastic Pollution

This is one of the most significant environmental issues facing synthetic textiles.

### What Are Microplastics?

Microplastics are tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size. When you wash synthetic clothing, friction releases microscopic fibres that are too small for washing machine filters or water treatment plants to catch.

### The Scale of the Problem

- Synthetic textiles contribute **35% of ocean microplastics**
- A single wash can release **640,000-1,500,000 microfibres**
- Acrylic releases the most: ~730,000 fibres per wash
- Polyester fleece releases about 7,360 fibres per square metre per litre of water

These microplastics:
- Enter waterways and oceans
- Are consumed by marine life
- Enter the food chain
- Have been found in drinking water, food, and even human blood

### What Can Be Done?

- Use a **Guppyfriend washing bag** or **Cora Ball** to catch microfibres
- Wash synthetic clothing less frequently
- Use shorter, cooler wash cycles
- Choose natural fibres when possible
- Support development of biodegradable synthetics

---

## Biodegradability

How long does it take for different fibres to break down at end of life?

| Fibre | Decomposition Time | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Linen | 2 weeks - few months | Most biodegradable common fibre |
| Cotton | 1 week - 5 months | Depends on conditions |
| Hemp | Similar to linen | Highly biodegradable |
| Wool | 1-5 years | Depends on conditions |
| Silk | Similar to wool | Natural protein fibre |
| Lyocell | ~55 days | Regenerated cellulose |
| Nylon | 30-40 years | Synthetic |
| Polyester | 20-200 years | Non-biodegradable |
| Acrylic | ~200 years | Non-biodegradable |

**Why this matters:** The fashion industry produces about **92 million tonnes** of textile waste globally each year. If those textiles are synthetic, they'll remain in landfill for generations.

---

## The Mulesing Controversy

**Mulesing** is a surgical procedure performed on Merino sheep in Australia to prevent flystrike (blowfly infestation). It involves removing skin from around the tail area to create scar tissue that doesn't attract flies.

### The Issue

- Mulesing has been standard practice in Australia for decades
- It protects sheep from the often-fatal suffering of flystrike
- However, it causes pain and distress to the animals
- Animal welfare groups have campaigned against it
- Some international buyers now refuse mulesed wool

### Current Situation

- About **70%** of Australian Merino sheep are mulesed
- Victoria requires mandatory pain relief during the procedure
- The **National Wool Declaration** allows growers to declare mulesing status
- About **17%** of Australian wool is now sold as "non-mulesed"
- Research continues into alternatives, including breeding for "plain-bodied" sheep that don't require mulesing

---

## Textile Waste and the Circular Economy

### The Problem

The current textile system is mostly **linear**: resources are extracted → products are made → products are used → products are thrown away.

**Sobering statistics:**
- Australians discard approximately **23 kg of textiles per person per year** to landfill
- Australia is the **2nd highest textile consumer per capita** globally
- Global textile-to-textile recycling achieves **less than 1%**—virtually no clothing is being made into new clothing
- The average garment is worn only **7-10 times** before being discarded

### Circular Economy Solutions

A **circular economy** keeps materials in use as long as possible through:

**Design for longevity:** Creating quality items that last
**Design for recyclability:** Using single fibres rather than blends (blends are very difficult to recycle)
**Repair and reuse:** Extending product life through mending
**Resale and donation:** Giving items second (or third, or fourth) lives
**Recycling:** Converting old textiles into new fibres

### Current Initiatives

- **Better Cotton Initiative (BCI):** Trains farmers in sustainable practices; accounts for ~23% of global cotton
- **Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS):** Certifies organic fibre products
- **Responsible Wool Standard:** Ensures animal welfare standards (prohibits mulesing)
- **Textile recycling programs:** Some brands now accept old clothing for recycling

---

## Making Sustainable Choices

As a consumer, you can consider:

1. **Buy less, choose well:** Quality over quantity
2. **Choose natural fibres when possible:** They biodegrade at end of life
3. **Consider fibre blends carefully:** 100% cotton is easier to recycle than cotton-polyester blends
4. **Look for certifications:** GOTS, Better Cotton, Responsible Wool Standard
5. **Care for your clothes:** Proper care extends life
6. **Wash synthetic items carefully:** Less frequent, cooler washes reduce microplastic release
7. **Donate or resell:** Extend the useful life of items
8. **Support circular fashion:** Choose brands committed to sustainability

# Chapter 8: Putting It All Together

## Comparing Fibre Properties

| Property | Cotton | Wool | Polyester | Nylon |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| Source | Plant | Animal | Petroleum | Petroleum |
| Absorbency | High | High | Very low | Low |
| Strength (dry) | Medium | Low-medium | High | Very high |
| Strength (wet) | HIGHER | Lower | Same | Same |
| Warmth | Low | High | Medium | Low |
| Wrinkle resistance | Low | Medium | High | Medium |
| Biodegradable | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Fire resistant | No | Yes | No | No |
| Typical use | T-shirts, jeans | Suits, knitwear | Activewear | Hosiery, swimwear |

---

## Why Fibres Are Blended

Many fabrics contain **blends** of two or more fibres to combine beneficial properties:

**Cotton-polyester (polycotton):** Cotton's comfort and absorbency + polyester's durability and wrinkle resistance

**Wool-nylon:** Wool's warmth and comfort + nylon's strength and abrasion resistance (common in socks)

**Cotton-elastane (spandex):** Cotton's comfort + elastane's stretch (common in jeans)

**Wool-acrylic:** Wool's warmth + acrylic's lower cost and easy care

**The trade-off:** Blended fabrics are much harder to recycle because separating the different fibres is technically difficult and expensive.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).

GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.

TITLE: I can explain why hemp is considered an environmentally sustainable fibre
CODE: 3.6

WHAT (concept explanation):
Hemp reaches maturity in just 90-120 days (versus cotton's 150-180), requires about 50% less water than cotton, needs no pesticides due to natural pest resistance, and produces 2 times more fibre per hectare than cotton.

WHY (importance):
As sustainability becomes more important in textiles, understanding hemp's environmental advantages helps evaluate claims about eco-friendly fabrics.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Hemp was legalised for food in Australia in November 2017, with about 9,000 hectares cultivated in 2019-2020. Hemp fibre is 3-4 times stronger than cotton. The deep roots prevent erosion and can remove toxins from soil (phytoremediation).

SUBTOPIC: Natural Fibres: Animal and Plant
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers silk production and luxury animal fibres (cashmere, mohair, alpaca, angora), as well as plant fibres including cotton, linen, and hemp. You will learn about production processes, unique properties, and common misconceptions about bamboo fabric.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Natural fibres each have distinct properties that make them suitable for different applications. Understanding their production and characteristics helps you evaluate textile claims and make informed choices about fabric selection.

TOPIC: Fibre Production
SUBJECT: Textiles | YEAR LEVEL: Year 7
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Analyse how fibres are produced in managed environments, from natural sources like wool and cotton to synthetic manufacturing, and evaluate the sustainability challenges facing the textile industry.

# Fibre Production: From Farm and Factory to Fabric

## A Textbook for Year 7-8 Students | Victorian Curriculum VCDSTC046

---

# Welcome to Fibre Production

Look down at what you're wearing right now. Your school uniform, your socks, your jumper—every piece of clothing started as a raw material somewhere in the world. Maybe it was wool from a sheep on an Australian farm, cotton from a plant in Queensland, or polyester made from oil in a factory overseas.

In this unit, you'll discover where textile fibres come from and how they're transformed into the fabrics we wear every day. You'll learn about Australia's important role in global fibre production, how farmers and manufacturers manage their environments to produce quality fibres, and the environmental challenges facing the textile industry.

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to:
- Identify different types of natural and synthetic fibres and their sources
- Explain how fibres are produced in managed environments
- Describe the processing stages that transform raw fibres into textiles
- Analyse the sustainability challenges of different fibre types
- Make informed decisions about textile choices based on their properties and environmental impacts

Let's unravel the story of fibres.

# Chapter 1: Understanding Textile Fibres

## What Is a Fibre?

A **fibre** is a thin, thread-like strand that can be spun into yarn and then woven or knitted into fabric. Fibres are the basic building blocks of all textiles—from the t-shirt on your back to the carpet under your feet.

Fibres can be classified into three main categories based on where they come from:

### 1. Natural Fibres

These come directly from plants or animals and have been used for thousands of years.

**Animal fibres** include:
- Wool (from sheep)
- Silk (from silkworms)
- Alpaca, cashmere, mohair, angora (from various animals)

**Plant fibres** include:
- Cotton (from the cotton plant)
- Linen (from the flax plant)
- Hemp (from the hemp plant)
- Jute, sisal, bamboo

### 2. Synthetic Fibres

These are entirely human-made, usually from petroleum (crude oil) products. They're manufactured in factories through chemical processes.

**Examples include:**
- Polyester
- Nylon
- Acrylic

### 3. Semi-Synthetic (Regenerated) Fibres

These start with a natural material (usually wood pulp) but are chemically processed to create the fibre. They sit between natural and synthetic.

**Examples include:**
- Rayon/Viscose
- Lyocell (TENCEL™)
- Modal

---

## Staple Fibres vs Filament Fibres

Before we dive deeper, there's an important distinction to understand:

**Staple fibres** are short lengths of fibre (from a few centimetres to about 50cm) that must be twisted together (spun) to create a continuous yarn. Most natural fibres are staple fibres—cotton, wool, and linen all come in short pieces that need to be spun.

**Filament fibres** are very long continuous strands. Silk is the only natural filament fibre—a single silk cocoon produces 600-900 metres of unbroken thread! All synthetic fibres are produced as filaments (though they can be cut into staple lengths if desired).

---

## Why Fibre Properties Matter

Different fibres have different properties—characteristics that determine how they behave and what they're best used for. Understanding these properties helps designers and manufacturers choose the right fibre for each purpose.

Key properties include:

| Property | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Absorbency** | How much moisture the fibre can soak up | Affects comfort, drying time, stain resistance |
| **Strength** | How much force needed to break the fibre | Affects durability and wear resistance |
| **Elasticity** | How much it can stretch and return to shape | Affects comfort and shape retention |
| **Thermal properties** | How it conducts or insulates heat | Affects warmth and comfort in different climates |
| **Flammability** | How easily it catches fire | Affects safety, especially for children's wear |
| **Biodegradability** | How quickly it breaks down naturally | Affects environmental impact at end of life |

As we explore each fibre type, pay attention to these properties—they explain why certain fibres are chosen for specific uses.

# Chapter 2: Wool – Australia's Golden Fleece

Australia is one of the world's most important wool-producing nations. We produce about **25% of the world's apparel wool**—that's wool used for clothing rather than carpets. Understanding wool production helps you understand both Australia's agricultural history and how managed environments work.

---

## The Australian Wool Industry

Wool has been central to Australia's economy since the early colonial period. The first Merino sheep arrived in Australia in **1797**, and by **1870**, Australia had become the world's largest wool producer—a position we still hold today.

### Australia's Wool Industry by the Numbers

- **68.5 million sheep** across Australia
- **280 million kg** of greasy (unwashed) wool produced annually
- **99% exported**—mostly to China (82-86% of exports)
- Major wool-producing states: New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia

### The Merino Advantage

While there are many sheep breeds, the **Merino** is the most important for fine wool production. Merino wool is prized for being:
- Very fine (thin fibres)
- Soft against the skin
- Excellent for high-quality clothing

Different Merino strains suit different Australian environments:

| Merino Type | Fibre Fineness | Best Environment |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Saxon Merino | ≤20 microns (very fine) | High-rainfall areas |
| Peppin Merino | 21-22 microns | Wheat-sheep zones |
| South Australian Strongwool | 23-26 microns | Dry pastoral areas |

**What's a micron?** A micron (μm) is one-millionth of a metre. Human hair is about 70 microns thick, while the finest Merino wool can be as thin as 12 microns—so fine you can barely see a single fibre!

---

## From Sheep to Sweater: The Wool Production Process

Wool goes through many stages before it becomes the jumper in your wardrobe. Let's follow the journey:

### Stage 1: Shearing

**Shearing** is the removal of the sheep's fleece. In Australia, this happens once a year, usually in spring after the cold winter months.

Professional shearers use electric handpieces (like heavy-duty hair clippers) to remove the fleece in one piece. A skilled shearer can shear a sheep in just **2-3 minutes** and may shear 150-200 sheep per day.

The average fleece weighs about **4-5 kg**, but this will reduce significantly during processing as impurities are removed.

**Fun fact:** Sheep don't feel pain during shearing—it's like getting a haircut! Their wool grows continuously, so regular shearing is actually necessary for their health and comfort.

### Stage 2: Skirting and Classing

Once removed, the fleece is spread out on a large skirting table. Workers remove the lower-quality wool from the edges (belly wool, leg wool) and any heavily contaminated sections. This is called **skirting**.

A **wool classer** then grades the fleece based on:
- Fibre diameter (micron count)
- Staple length (how long the fibres are)
- Staple strength
- Vegetable matter content (seeds, burrs)
- Colour and condition

Different grades are separated and packed into wool bales (large compressed packages weighing about 180 kg each).

### Stage 3: Wool Auction

Most Australian wool is sold at auction through the **Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX)**. Buyers from around the world (mostly from China) bid on wool bales based on their specifications.

The **Eastern Market Indicator (EMI)** is the benchmark price for Australian wool, typically ranging from 1,100-1,550 cents per kilogram of clean wool.

### Stage 4: Scouring

Raw wool straight from the sheep is called **greasy wool** because it contains:
- **Lanolin** (wool grease/wax)—about 10-25% of the weight
- **Suint** (dried sweat)
- Dirt and dust
- Vegetable matter

**Scouring** is the washing process that removes these impurities. The wool passes through a series of large tanks containing water at **60-65°C** and detergent.

After scouring, the wool loses about **30% of its original weight**—all those impurities are gone! The recovered lanolin is valuable too—it's used in cosmetics and skincare products.

### Stage 5: Carding

**Carding** uses large cylinders covered in fine wire teeth to:
- Separate and untangle the fibres
- Remove any remaining vegetable matter
- Align fibres roughly parallel
- Form fibres into a soft rope called a **sliver**

### Stage 6: Combing (for Worsted Wool)

For the finest wool products, an additional **combing** step removes shorter fibres and makes all remaining fibres lie perfectly parallel. This produces **worsted wool**—used for smooth, fine fabrics like suit material.

Wool that skips this step becomes **woollen yarn**—loftier, softer, and used for things like knitting yarn and blankets.

### Stage 7: Spinning

**Spinning** twists the fibres together to create yarn. The twist holds the fibres in place and gives the yarn its strength.

- More twist = stronger, thinner yarn (good for weaving)
- Less twist = softer, loftier yarn (good for knitwear)

### Stage 8: Fabric Construction

Finally, yarn becomes fabric through either:
- **Weaving**: Interlacing two sets of yarns (warp and weft) at right angles on a loom
- **Knitting**: Interlocking loops of yarn together

---

## What Makes Wool Special?

Wool has some remarkable properties that make it valuable for certain uses:

### Moisture Management

Wool can absorb **30-35% of its own weight in moisture** without feeling wet to the touch. This is because wool fibres have a complex structure with a water-resistant outer layer and an absorbent inner core.

**Why this matters:** Wool clothing keeps you comfortable by absorbing sweat and releasing it slowly into the air. This is why wool is popular for activewear and outdoor clothing.

### Temperature Regulation

The natural **crimp** (waviness) in wool fibres creates millions of tiny air pockets. Air is an excellent insulator, so these pockets trap warmth in cold weather.

But wool also helps in warm weather—as moisture evaporates from wool, it creates a cooling effect.

**Why this matters:** Wool keeps you warm when it's cold and helps regulate temperature when it's warm. This is why Merino wool base layers are popular with hikers and athletes.

### Fire Resistance

Wool is naturally **fire-resistant**. It won't ignite until it reaches **570-600°C** (compare this to cotton, which ignites at just 255°C). Even more importantly, wool requires **25.2% oxygen** to burn, but our atmosphere only contains 21% oxygen—so wool struggles to sustain a flame.

When wool does burn, it tends to smoulder and self-extinguish rather than producing flames. It doesn't melt or drip like synthetic fibres.

**Why this matters:** Wool is used for aircraft seat covers, firefighter uniforms, and children's sleepwear because of its safety properties.

### Elasticity

Wool fibres can stretch up to **30% of their length** and spring back to their original shape. This natural elasticity helps wool garments resist wrinkling and maintain their shape.

### Natural Odour Resistance

The structure of wool fibres resists bacterial growth, meaning wool clothing stays fresher for longer between washes.

---

## Wool Quality and Grading

The value of wool depends primarily on its **micron count**—the diameter of the fibres measured in microns.

| Grade | Micron Range | Typical Use | Relative Value |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Ultrafine | <15.5 | Luxury fashion, next-to-skin | Highest |
| Superfine | 15.6-18.5 | High-end apparel | Very high |
| Fine | 18.6-20.5 | Quality suiting, knitwear | High |
| Medium | 20.6-23.5 | Outerwear, blankets | Medium |
| Strong/Broad | >23.5 | Carpets, industrial | Lower |

**Why finer is more valuable:** Finer fibres feel softer against the skin, drape better, and can be woven into lighter, more luxurious fabrics.

---

## The Woolmark System

You may have seen the **Woolmark** logo on clothing labels—a stylised ball of yarn that's one of the world's most recognised textile symbols.

Created in **1964**, the Woolmark is a certification system owned by **The Woolmark Company** (part of Australian Wool Innovation). Products must pass strict testing to carry the logo:

| Logo | Requirements |
|------|--------------|
| **Woolmark** | 100% pure new wool |
| **Woolmark Blend** | 50-99.9% new wool |
| **Wool Blend** | 30-49.9% new wool |

Products are tested for fibre content, colourfastness (colour doesn't fade), physical strength, and wash performance.

# Chapter 3: Other Animal Fibres

While wool dominates animal fibre production, several other animals provide valuable fibres with unique properties.

---

## Silk: Nature's Only Filament Fibre

Silk is one of the most luxurious and fascinating fibres in the world. It's the only natural fibre that comes as a continuous filament rather than short staple lengths.

### The Silkworm Lifecycle

Silk comes from the cocoon of the **Bombyx mori**—the domesticated silkworm (actually a caterpillar, not a worm!). The production of silk is called **sericulture**, and it follows a precise lifecycle:

**Stage 1: Egg (10-14 days)**
Female silk moths lay 300-500 tiny eggs, each about the size of a pinhead. The eggs are kept at controlled temperatures until they hatch.

**Stage 2: Larva/Caterpillar (23-28 days)**
The newly hatched silkworm is tiny—about 3mm long. Over the next month, it does nothing but eat mulberry leaves. And eat. And eat some more.

During this stage, the silkworm grows to **10,000 times its original size**—imagine if a human baby grew that much! It moults (sheds its skin) four times as it outgrows each skin.

**Stage 3: Cocoon Spinning (2-3 days)**
When fully grown (about 7.5cm long), the silkworm stops eating and begins spinning its cocoon. Moving its head in a figure-8 pattern, it produces a continuous silk filament from glands near its mouth.

A single silkworm produces **600-900 metres** of continuous silk thread in just 2-3 days!

**Stage 4: Pupa (2-3 weeks)**
Inside the cocoon, the silkworm transforms into a moth through metamorphosis.

### Harvesting Silk

Here's where silk production becomes controversial: to harvest the silk as one continuous filament, the cocoons must be collected **before the moth emerges**. If the moth breaks through the cocoon, it breaks the continuous filament into many short pieces, making the silk much less valuable.

Traditional silk production involves killing the pupa inside by:
- Heating the cocoons (sun-drying or steam)
- This also softens the **sericin** (silk gum) holding the filament together

The silk is then **reeled**—the filament from several cocoons (usually 4-8) is combined and wound together to create a usable thread.

**Scale of production:** It takes approximately **3,000 cocoons** to produce just 1 kg of silk, and **104 kg of mulberry leaves** to feed those silkworms!

### Silk Properties

Silk is prized for its:
- **Lustrous appearance**—it reflects light beautifully
- **Incredible strength**—stronger than steel of the same diameter
- **Excellent drape**—flows and hangs elegantly
- **Temperature regulation**—cool in summer, warm in winter
- **Hypoallergenic** qualities—good for sensitive skin

### Peace Silk (Ahimsa Silk)

Some producers now make **peace silk** or **Ahimsa silk**, which allows the moth to emerge naturally before harvesting the cocoon. This produces shorter fibres that must be spun like other staple fibres, resulting in a slightly different texture.

---

## Luxury Animal Fibres

### Cashmere

**Source:** The soft undercoat of cashmere goats, primarily from Mongolia, China, and Iran.

**What makes it special:** To be classified as cashmere, fibres must be **less than 19 microns** in diameter—even finer than most Merino wool. This extreme fineness gives cashmere its legendary softness.

**Production challenges:** Each goat produces only **150-200 grams** of cashmere per year (compared to 4-5 kg of wool per sheep). This scarcity, combined with the hand-combing required to collect it, makes cashmere expensive.

### Mohair

**Source:** The Angora goat (not to be confused with Angora fibre, which comes from rabbits!).

**What makes it special:** Mohair has exceptional lustre (shine), durability, and takes dye brilliantly. It's often blended with wool to add sheen and strength.

**Production:** Each Angora goat produces **3.6-7.3 kg** of mohair per year.

### Alpaca

**Source:** Alpacas, members of the camelid family native to South America. Australia now has a growing alpaca industry.

**What makes it special:** Alpaca fibre is **3-7 times warmer than sheep's wool** because the fibres are partially hollow, trapping more air. It also contains no lanolin, making it naturally hypoallergenic.

**Production:** Each alpaca produces **3-7 kg** of fibre per year.

### Angora

**Source:** Angora rabbits (remember: Angora rabbits give angora; Angora goats give mohair!).

**What makes it special:** Angora is **6 times warmer than wool** due to its hollow fibre structure. It's incredibly soft and lightweight.

**Production challenges:** Each rabbit produces only about **400 grams** per year, and the fibre must be carefully harvested by combing or shearing.

---

## Common Confusion Alert!

Students often confuse these terms:

| Term | Source Animal | Key Fact |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Angora** | Angora RABBIT | 6× warmer than wool |
| **Mohair** | Angora GOAT | High lustre, durable |

Remember: The fibre name and animal name don't always match!

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. Why is silk called a "filament fibre" while wool is a "staple fibre"?
2. How long is the silk filament from a single cocoon?
3. Why must silk cocoons be harvested before the moth emerges?
4. What is the maximum micron count for a fibre to be called cashmere?
5. Which animal does angora fibre come from? Which animal does mohair come from?

---

# Chapter 4: Plant Fibres

Plant fibres have been used for textiles for thousands of years. Cotton is by far the most important, but linen, hemp, and other fibres each have their own story and unique properties.

---

## Cotton: The World's Most Popular Natural Fibre

Cotton is everywhere. Look at the labels in your clothes—chances are most of them contain at least some cotton. Globally, cotton accounts for about **25% of all fibre production**.

### Australia's Cotton Industry

Australia is a significant cotton producer, with a unique story:

- **91% of Australian cotton** is grown in the Murray-Darling Basin (NSW and Queensland)
- Australia produces **4.4-5.5 million bales** annually (depending on water availability)
- Our yields are approximately **3 times the world average** due to advanced farming practices
- **Over 99%** of Australian cotton is exported, mainly to Southeast Asian textile mills

### How Cotton Grows

Cotton comes from plants in the genus *Gossypium*. The cotton "fibre" is actually the protective fluff surrounding the seeds inside the cotton boll (seed pod).

**The growing cycle (150-180 days):**

1. **Planting** (September-November in Australia)
   - Seeds need soil temperature of at least 15°C to germinate
   - Each seed produces a single plant

2. **Vegetative growth** (first 5-6 weeks)
   - Plants develop stems and leaves
   - Roots grow deep to access water

3. **Square formation** (~5 weeks after planting)
   - "Squares" are the flower buds
   - Plants begin reproductive phase

4. **Flowering** (~8 weeks after planting)
   - Flowers open white/cream coloured
   - After pollination, they turn pink then red
   - Each flower produces one boll

5. **Boll development** (50-55 days after flowering)
   - Inside each boll, 32-40 seeds develop
   - Each seed grows thousands of fibres
   - Fibres are almost pure cellulose (plant material)

6. **Boll opening** (maturity)
   - Bolls dry and split open, revealing white cotton
   - A healthy plant may have 100-120 bolls
   - Each boll contains about 500,000 individual fibres!

7. **Harvest** (March-May in Australia)
   - Defoliants remove leaves to ease picking
   - Mechanical harvesters collect the cotton
   - "Seed cotton" includes fibres, seeds, and trash

### Processing: From Field to Fibre

**Ginning** is the critical first step—separating the cotton fibres from the seeds.

When seed cotton enters the gin:
- **35-42%** becomes lint (the usable fibre)
- **48-55%** is cottonseed (used for oil and animal feed)
- **3-10%** is trash and waste

The lint is then compressed into bales weighing about 227 kg each.

**Subsequent processing** follows similar steps to wool:
1. **Opening and cleaning**—loosening compressed bales, removing remaining debris
2. **Carding**—aligning fibres into a sliver
3. **Combing** (optional)—for finer cotton, removes short fibres
4. **Drawing**—combines and stretches slivers for uniformity
5. **Spinning**—twists fibres into yarn
6. **Weaving or knitting**—creates fabric

### Cotton's Unique Properties

Cotton has some properties that make it ideal for everyday clothing:

**Absorbency:** Cotton can absorb **24-27 times its own weight** in water. This makes it comfortable to wear because it absorbs sweat from your skin.

**Strength when wet:** Here's something surprising—unlike most fibres, cotton actually gets **STRONGER when wet**, increasing in strength by **20-25%**. This is why cotton can withstand repeated washing without falling apart.

**Why does cotton get stronger wet?** Water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the cellulose in cotton fibres, actually helping hold them together more tightly!

**Breathability:** Cotton's structure allows air to circulate, keeping you cool.

**Biodegradability:** As a natural cellulose fibre, cotton breaks down relatively quickly—**1 week to 5 months** depending on conditions.

**Drawbacks:** Cotton wrinkles easily, dries slowly, and can shrink when washed.

---

## Linen: Ancient Luxury

Linen is made from the fibres of the **flax plant** (*Linum usitatissimum*). It's one of the oldest textile fibres—evidence of linen fabric dates back over 30,000 years!

### Why Australia Doesn't Grow Flax

Australia has no significant linen production because flax needs:
- Cool, moist climates
- Specific soil conditions
- Labour-intensive harvesting

Most linen comes from Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe.

### The Retting Process

The key step in linen production is **retting**—using controlled bacterial decomposition to break down the pectin (plant glue) that binds fibres to the woody stem.

**Dew retting:** Flax stalks are spread in fields for about 3 weeks. Morning dew and bacteria gradually break down the pectin. This produces silver/grey coloured fibres.

**Water retting:** Stalks are submerged in water for 10-30 days. Faster and more controlled, but requires careful monitoring—over-retting damages the fibres; under-retting makes them impossible to separate.

After retting:
- **Scutching** beats the stalks to remove woody pieces
- **Hackling** combs out the fibres and separates long "line" fibres from short "tow" fibres

### Linen Properties

Linen is valued for:

**Exceptional strength:** Linen is **2-3 times stronger than cotton** and one of the strongest natural fibres available.

**Durability:** Linen products can last **up to 30 years** with proper care—the fibres actually get softer and more comfortable with age and washing.

**Cool comfort:** Linen conducts heat very well, carrying warmth away from your body. This is why linen clothing feels so cool in summer.

**Quick drying:** Linen absorbs moisture well but releases it quickly.

**Sustainability:** Linen is highly biodegradable—it can break down in just a **few weeks** when buried in soil.

**Drawbacks:** Linen wrinkles easily (those wrinkles are considered part of its character!), is more expensive than cotton, and has limited elasticity.

---

## Hemp: The Sustainable Superstar

Hemp (*Cannabis sativa*) is gaining attention as one of the most sustainable fibre options available. Don't worry—industrial hemp is not the same as marijuana, even though they're related plants.

### Hemp in Australia

Hemp farming has a complicated history in Australia due to its relationship with cannabis. However, industrial hemp (which contains less than **0.35-1% THC** depending on state regulations) was legalised for food in **November 2017**, and fibre production is regulated by each state.

About **9,000 hectares** were cultivated in Australia in 2019-2020, with growing interest from farmers and textile companies.

### Why Hemp Is Considered Sustainable

Hemp has remarkable environmental credentials:

**Fast growth:** Hemp reaches maturity in just **90-120 days** (compare to cotton's 150-180 days).

**Low water needs:** Hemp requires about **50% less water** than cotton.

**No pesticides needed:** Hemp naturally resists most pests and diseases.

**High yield:** Hemp produces **2 times more fibre per hectare** than cotton.

**Soil improvement:** Hemp's deep roots prevent erosion and can even help remove toxins from contaminated soil (a process called phytoremediation).

**Carbon capture:** Hemp absorbs large amounts of CO₂ as it grows.

### Hemp Fibre Properties

Hemp produces some of the strongest natural fibres available:

- **3-4 times stronger than cotton**
- Excellent durability and abrasion resistance
- Gets softer with washing
- Naturally resistant to mould and UV light
- Highly breathable
- Biodegradable

**Drawbacks:** Hemp processing is labour-intensive, the fabric can feel rough initially, and limited processing infrastructure currently exists in Australia.

## The Bamboo Misconception

You've probably seen "bamboo" clothing advertised as natural and eco-friendly. Here's something important you need to know:

**Most "bamboo fabric" is actually rayon/viscose made FROM bamboo—not actual bamboo fibre.**

### What's Really Happening

True bamboo linen—made by mechanically processing bamboo stalks—does exist but is:
- Rare
- Rough in texture
- Expensive to produce

The soft "bamboo" clothing commonly sold in stores is made by:
1. Dissolving bamboo pulp in harsh chemicals (sodium hydroxide, carbon disulfide)
2. Extruding the solution through spinnerets to create fibres
3. The result is rayon/viscose—a semi-synthetic fibre

**The problem:** After this chemical processing, **no trace of the original bamboo properties remains**. The resulting fibre is chemically identical to rayon made from any other plant source.

The US Federal Trade Commission requires such products to be labelled as "rayon made from bamboo" rather than simply "bamboo."

**Why this matters:** Some companies market bamboo rayon as "eco-friendly" because bamboo grows quickly without pesticides. However, the chemical processing involved can be highly polluting, potentially cancelling out those environmental benefits.

# Chapter 5: Synthetic Fibres

Synthetic fibres are entirely human-made, typically from petroleum (crude oil) products. They've revolutionised the textile industry since their invention in the 20th century, offering properties that natural fibres can't match.

---

## How Synthetic Fibres Are Made

All synthetic fibres are created through a similar basic process:

1. **Polymerisation:** Chemicals derived from petroleum are reacted together to form long-chain molecules called polymers.

2. **Melting or dissolving:** The polymer is melted or dissolved into a thick, syrup-like liquid.

3. **Extrusion:** The liquid is forced through a **spinneret**—a metal plate with tiny holes (like a showerhead, but with holes just 0.05-0.1mm in diameter).

4. **Solidification:** The fibres solidify as they emerge from the spinneret (by cooling, evaporation, or chemical reaction).

5. **Drawing:** The fibres are stretched to align the polymer molecules, increasing strength.

6. **Texturising (optional):** Fibres can be crimped, curled, or otherwise modified to change their properties.

The shape of the spinneret holes determines the fibre's cross-section:
- Round holes → standard fibres
- Triangular holes → fibres with enhanced lustre
- Hollow centres → fibres with better insulation

Because synthetic fibres are manufactured, their properties can be precisely controlled by adjusting the chemicals used, hole shapes, and processing conditions.

## Polyester: The Dominant Fibre

Polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, or PET) is the most widely used fibre in the world, accounting for about **57% of global fibre production**.

### How Polyester Is Made

Polyester production uses **melt spinning** at high temperatures (**260-270°C**):

1. Chemicals react at 150-210°C to form polyester polymer
2. Molten polyester is extruded, cooled, and cut into small chips
3. Chips are remelted to a syrup-like consistency
4. The liquid is forced through spinneret holes
5. Emerging fibres are cooled by air
6. Fibres are stretched **up to 5 times** their original length to align molecules

### Polyester Properties

**Advantages:**
- Very low moisture absorption (**0.4-1%**)—dries quickly
- Wrinkle resistant—holds its shape well
- Strong and durable
- Resistant to stretching and shrinking
- Easy to care for (machine washable, quick drying)
- Takes colour well
- Inexpensive to produce

**Disadvantages:**
- Not breathable—can feel hot and clammy
- Can hold body odours
- Static electricity buildup
- Derived from non-renewable petroleum
- **Non-biodegradable: takes 20-200 years to decompose**
- Releases microplastic fibres when washed

### Recycled Polyester (rPET)

Polyester can be made from recycled plastic bottles (PET bottles). This **recycled polyester (rPET)** offers significant environmental benefits:
- Reduces plastic waste going to landfill
- Uses **59-79% less energy** than virgin polyester
- Produces fewer carbon emissions

**However, there's a catch:** Research shows that recycled polyester may actually release **more microplastic fibres** during washing than virgin polyester, because the recycled fibres are often shorter and weaker.

---

## Nylon: The First Synthetic Fibre

Nylon holds a special place in textile history as the **first fully synthetic fibre**. It was invented on **February 28, 1935** by Wallace Carothers at DuPont in the USA.

When nylon stockings went on sale in 1940, they caused a sensation—stores sold out within hours, and "nylon riots" occurred as women fought to buy them!

### Nylon Properties

- **Extremely strong:** Stronger than steel of the same diameter
- **Excellent elasticity:** Stretches and recovers well
- **Abrasion resistant:** Stands up to friction and wear
- **Lightweight:** Despite its strength
- **Quick drying:** Low moisture absorption
- **Smooth:** Soft feel against skin

**Disadvantages:**
- Can feel hot in warm weather
- Sensitive to UV light (degrades in sunlight)
- Static buildup
- Made from petroleum
- Takes **30-40 years** to decompose

### Common Uses

Nylon's strength and elasticity make it ideal for:
- Hosiery (stockings, tights)
- Activewear and swimwear
- Parachutes
- Ropes and fishing nets
- Toothbrush bristles
- Carpet fibres

---

## Acrylic: The Wool Substitute

Acrylic was developed as a cheaper alternative to wool. By definition, acrylic fibres contain at least **85% acrylonitrile** (a petroleum-derived chemical).

### Acrylic Properties

**Advantages:**
- Wool-like warmth and softness
- Lightweight
- Resistant to moths (unlike wool)
- Holds colour well
- Relatively inexpensive
- Machine washable

**Disadvantages:**
- Pills easily (forms little balls on the surface)
- Not as warm as real wool
- Static buildup
- Not breathable
- Non-biodegradable (takes **~200 years** to decompose)
- **Releases the most microplastic fibres of any synthetic**

### The Microplastic Problem

Acrylic has a significant environmental issue: it releases approximately **730,000 microplastic fibres per wash**—about **5 times more** than polyester-cotton blends.

These tiny plastic particles are too small for washing machine filters to catch, so they flow into waterways and eventually the ocean.

---

## The Semi-Synthetic Category: Rayon and Lyocell

Some fibres don't fit neatly into "natural" or "synthetic" categories. **Rayon** (also called viscose) and **lyocell** are made from natural materials (wood pulp) but through chemical processing. They're called **semi-synthetic** or **regenerated cellulose** fibres.

### Traditional Viscose/Rayon

Viscose was developed in the late 1800s as a cheaper alternative to silk. The process:

1. Wood pulp (usually from eucalyptus, beech, or pine) is treated with **17.5% sodium hydroxide** (caustic soda)
2. The mixture is reacted with **carbon disulfide** (a toxic chemical)
3. The resulting "viscose" solution is extruded through spinnerets into a **sulfuric acid bath**
4. The cellulose regenerates as solid fibres

**The problem:** This process uses toxic chemicals and produces significant pollution. Carbon disulfide is hazardous to workers and the environment.

### Lyocell (TENCEL™): The Cleaner Alternative

Lyocell (branded as TENCEL™ by Lenzing) uses a much more sustainable **closed-loop process**:

1. Wood pulp is dissolved in a non-toxic solvent called NMMO
2. The solution is extruded through spinnerets
3. **99.8% of the solvent is recovered and recycled**
4. Much less water and energy are used

Lyocell fibres are:
- Strong (stronger than cotton when wet)
- Breathable
- Soft and smooth
- Biodegradable (**55 days** in soil)
- More sustainable than viscose

## Comparing Synthetic Fibres

| Fibre | Made From | Key Property | Decomposition Time |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Polyester | Petroleum | Quick-drying, wrinkle-resistant | 20-200 years |
| Nylon | Petroleum | Extremely strong, elastic | 30-40 years |
| Acrylic | Petroleum | Wool-like warmth | ~200 years |
| Rayon/Viscose | Wood pulp | Silk-like drape | Months-years |
| Lyocell | Wood pulp | Strong, sustainable | ~55 days |

# Chapter 6: Managed Environments for Fibre Production

The Victorian Curriculum asks you to understand how fibres are produced in **managed environments**. But what exactly does this mean?

---

## What Is a Managed Environment?

A **managed environment** is a production system where humans control key factors to optimise outcomes. In fibre production, this includes:

- **Selecting breeds/varieties** suited to local conditions
- **Controlling inputs** (water, nutrients, pest management)
- **Managing timing** (planting, harvesting)
- **Using technology** to monitor and improve production
- **Applying quality standards** throughout the process

Managed environments exist on a spectrum—from extensive sheep stations where management is relatively light-touch, to intensive cotton farms with precise irrigation control, to factory settings for synthetic fibre production.

---

## Managed Environments: Wool Production

Australian sheep stations represent managed grazing environments. Key management practices include:

### Breed Selection

Farmers choose sheep breeds suited to their specific conditions:
- Fine-wool Merinos for higher-rainfall areas
- Stronger-wool breeds for harsh pastoral zones
- Crossbreeds for dual-purpose (wool and meat) production

### Pasture Management

- **Rotational grazing:** Moving sheep between paddocks to allow pastures to recover
- **Stocking rates:** Adjusting sheep numbers based on available feed
- **Supplementary feeding:** Providing additional nutrition during drought or when pastures are poor

### Water Management

- Installing bores (wells) and dams
- Creating watering points throughout properties
- Managing water distribution during dry periods

### Health Management

- Vaccination programs
- Parasite control (drenching)
- Shearing timing for animal welfare
- Managing flystrike (a significant welfare and economic issue)

### Technology Integration

Modern wool production increasingly uses:
- GPS tracking of livestock
- Drones for monitoring pastures and animals
- Weather stations for decision-making
- Digital platforms like WoolClip for recording fleece specifications

---

## Managed Environments: Cotton Production

Cotton farming involves more intensive management than wool production:

### Climate Requirements

Cotton needs:
- Long, hot growing season (150+ frost-free days)
- Minimum soil temperature of 15°C for germination
- Adequate water during key growth stages
- Dry conditions for harvest

In Australia, this limits cotton production primarily to northern NSW and Queensland.

### Water Management

Water is the critical management factor for Australian cotton. Methods include:

**Furrow irrigation:** Water flows down channels between crop rows
**Centre-pivot irrigation:** Rotating sprinkler systems
**Drip irrigation:** Water delivered directly to plant roots (most efficient)

Cotton farms typically use **6-8 megalitres per hectare** per season. The industry has improved water-use efficiency by about **40% since 1992** through better management and technology.

### Pest Management

Cotton plants are vulnerable to many pests. Australian cotton farmers use **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:

- **Monitoring:** Regular scouting and trapping to track pest populations
- **Biological control:** Encouraging beneficial insects that eat pests
- **Genetic resistance:** Planting varieties with built-in pest resistance
- **Targeted spraying:** Using pesticides only when necessary and in specific areas

### Harvest Timing

Getting harvest timing right is crucial:
- Too early: Immature fibres reduce quality
- Too late: Weather damage, increased trash
- Defoliation: Chemical removal of leaves 2-3 weeks before picking to ease mechanical harvest

### Quality Assurance: myBMP

Cotton Australia runs the **myBMP (Best Management Practices)** program. Certified farms must meet **over 300 criteria** covering:
- Water management
- Pest management
- Soil health
- Employee safety
- Environmental protection

About **30%** of Australian cotton is fully certified under this program.

---

## Managed Environments: Synthetic Fibre Production

Factory production represents the most controlled managed environment:

### Controlled Conditions

Synthetic fibre factories maintain precise control over:
- **Temperature:** Specific temperatures for each production stage
- **Chemical concentrations:** Exact formulations for consistent results
- **Air quality:** Clean room conditions for some processes
- **Humidity:** Affects fibre properties during formation

### Quality Control

Modern synthetic fibre production includes:
- Continuous monitoring of fibre diameter
- Testing of tensile strength
- Colour consistency measurement
- Detection of defects

### Automation

Most synthetic fibre production is highly automated:
- Computer-controlled processes
- Minimal human intervention
- Consistent output quality
- 24/7 operation capability

2. How do wool farmers manage their pastures sustainably?
3. Why is water management so critical for Australian cotton production?
4. What is Integrated Pest Management (IPM)?
5. How does a synthetic fibre factory differ from a sheep station in terms of environmental control?

---

# Chapter 7: Sustainability in Fibre Production

Every fibre—whether natural or synthetic—has environmental impacts. Understanding these impacts helps you make informed choices as a consumer and evaluate claims about "sustainable" textiles.

---

## Water Footprint

Different fibres require vastly different amounts of water to produce:

| Fibre | Water Use (litres per kg) | Context |
|-------|---------------------------|---------|
| Conventional cotton | 8,000-20,000 | One t-shirt ≈ 2,700 litres |
| Organic cotton | 243-2,000 | Up to 91% reduction |
| Hemp | 2,000-3,400 | ~50% less than conventional cotton |
| Linen | ~6,000 | Flax needs less irrigation |
| Wool | 500-800 | Plus processing water |
| Polyester | 60-100 | But uses petroleum instead |

**Important context about cotton:** The often-quoted figure of 10,000-20,000 litres per kg includes **all water** the cotton plant uses—including rainfall. About **73-75%** of cotton's water footprint comes from rain that would fall anyway, not irrigation.

Australian cotton is relatively efficient, producing more fibre per megalitre of irrigation water than most other countries due to advanced farming practices.

---

## Carbon Footprint

All fibre production generates greenhouse gas emissions:

### Natural Fibre Emissions

**Wool:** Surprisingly, wool has a relatively high carbon footprint of **19-25 kg CO₂e per kg** of fibre. About **50%** of this comes from sheep belching methane (yes, really!). Sheep produce approximately **30 litres of methane per day** through their digestive process.

**Cotton:** About **5.34 kg CO₂e per kg**—lower than wool, mainly from farming operations, fertiliser production, and processing.

### Synthetic Fibre Emissions

**Polyester:** About **5.5-9.5 kg CO₂e per kg** from petroleum extraction, chemical processing, and manufacturing.

**Recycled polyester:** **79% lower** emissions than virgin polyester because it uses existing plastic rather than extracting new petroleum.

---

## Pesticide Use

Cotton has historically been called "the world's dirtiest crop" because it uses a disproportionate amount of pesticides:

- Cotton uses approximately **6% of the world's pesticides**
- But cotton only covers about **2.4% of global cropland**
- Pesticides can pollute waterways and harm beneficial insects

**However, the Australian situation is different:**
- Australian cotton uses far fewer pesticides than the global average
- Genetically modified cotton varieties (about 99% of Australian cotton) have built-in pest resistance
- Integrated Pest Management has significantly reduced chemical use
- The myBMP program requires responsible pesticide use

**Organic cotton** uses no synthetic pesticides but may require more water and land to produce the same amount of fibre.

---

## Microplastic Pollution

This is one of the most significant environmental issues facing synthetic textiles.

### What Are Microplastics?

Microplastics are tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size. When you wash synthetic clothing, friction releases microscopic fibres that are too small for washing machine filters or water treatment plants to catch.

### The Scale of the Problem

- Synthetic textiles contribute **35% of ocean microplastics**
- A single wash can release **640,000-1,500,000 microfibres**
- Acrylic releases the most: ~730,000 fibres per wash
- Polyester fleece releases about 7,360 fibres per square metre per litre of water

These microplastics:
- Enter waterways and oceans
- Are consumed by marine life
- Enter the food chain
- Have been found in drinking water, food, and even human blood

### What Can Be Done?

- Use a **Guppyfriend washing bag** or **Cora Ball** to catch microfibres
- Wash synthetic clothing less frequently
- Use shorter, cooler wash cycles
- Choose natural fibres when possible
- Support development of biodegradable synthetics

---

## Biodegradability

How long does it take for different fibres to break down at end of life?

| Fibre | Decomposition Time | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Linen | 2 weeks - few months | Most biodegradable common fibre |
| Cotton | 1 week - 5 months | Depends on conditions |
| Hemp | Similar to linen | Highly biodegradable |
| Wool | 1-5 years | Depends on conditions |
| Silk | Similar to wool | Natural protein fibre |
| Lyocell | ~55 days | Regenerated cellulose |
| Nylon | 30-40 years | Synthetic |
| Polyester | 20-200 years | Non-biodegradable |
| Acrylic | ~200 years | Non-biodegradable |

**Why this matters:** The fashion industry produces about **92 million tonnes** of textile waste globally each year. If those textiles are synthetic, they'll remain in landfill for generations.

---

## The Mulesing Controversy

**Mulesing** is a surgical procedure performed on Merino sheep in Australia to prevent flystrike (blowfly infestation). It involves removing skin from around the tail area to create scar tissue that doesn't attract flies.

### The Issue

- Mulesing has been standard practice in Australia for decades
- It protects sheep from the often-fatal suffering of flystrike
- However, it causes pain and distress to the animals
- Animal welfare groups have campaigned against it
- Some international buyers now refuse mulesed wool

### Current Situation

- About **70%** of Australian Merino sheep are mulesed
- Victoria requires mandatory pain relief during the procedure
- The **National Wool Declaration** allows growers to declare mulesing status
- About **17%** of Australian wool is now sold as "non-mulesed"
- Research continues into alternatives, including breeding for "plain-bodied" sheep that don't require mulesing

---

## Textile Waste and the Circular Economy

### The Problem

The current textile system is mostly **linear**: resources are extracted → products are made → products are used → products are thrown away.

**Sobering statistics:**
- Australians discard approximately **23 kg of textiles per person per year** to landfill
- Australia is the **2nd highest textile consumer per capita** globally
- Global textile-to-textile recycling achieves **less than 1%**—virtually no clothing is being made into new clothing
- The average garment is worn only **7-10 times** before being discarded

### Circular Economy Solutions

A **circular economy** keeps materials in use as long as possible through:

**Design for longevity:** Creating quality items that last
**Design for recyclability:** Using single fibres rather than blends (blends are very difficult to recycle)
**Repair and reuse:** Extending product life through mending
**Resale and donation:** Giving items second (or third, or fourth) lives
**Recycling:** Converting old textiles into new fibres

### Current Initiatives

- **Better Cotton Initiative (BCI):** Trains farmers in sustainable practices; accounts for ~23% of global cotton
- **Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS):** Certifies organic fibre products
- **Responsible Wool Standard:** Ensures animal welfare standards (prohibits mulesing)
- **Textile recycling programs:** Some brands now accept old clothing for recycling

---

## Making Sustainable Choices

As a consumer, you can consider:

1. **Buy less, choose well:** Quality over quantity
2. **Choose natural fibres when possible:** They biodegrade at end of life
3. **Consider fibre blends carefully:** 100% cotton is easier to recycle than cotton-polyester blends
4. **Look for certifications:** GOTS, Better Cotton, Responsible Wool Standard
5. **Care for your clothes:** Proper care extends life
6. **Wash synthetic items carefully:** Less frequent, cooler washes reduce microplastic release
7. **Donate or resell:** Extend the useful life of items
8. **Support circular fashion:** Choose brands committed to sustainability

# Chapter 8: Putting It All Together

## Comparing Fibre Properties

| Property | Cotton | Wool | Polyester | Nylon |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| Source | Plant | Animal | Petroleum | Petroleum |
| Absorbency | High | High | Very low | Low |
| Strength (dry) | Medium | Low-medium | High | Very high |
| Strength (wet) | HIGHER | Lower | Same | Same |
| Warmth | Low | High | Medium | Low |
| Wrinkle resistance | Low | Medium | High | Medium |
| Biodegradable | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Fire resistant | No | Yes | No | No |
| Typical use | T-shirts, jeans | Suits, knitwear | Activewear | Hosiery, swimwear |

---

## Why Fibres Are Blended

Many fabrics contain **blends** of two or more fibres to combine beneficial properties:

**Cotton-polyester (polycotton):** Cotton's comfort and absorbency + polyester's durability and wrinkle resistance

**Wool-nylon:** Wool's warmth and comfort + nylon's strength and abrasion resistance (common in socks)

**Cotton-elastane (spandex):** Cotton's comfort + elastane's stretch (common in jeans)

**Wool-acrylic:** Wool's warmth + acrylic's lower cost and easy care

**The trade-off:** Blended fabrics are much harder to recycle because separating the different fibres is technically difficult and expensive.

TITLE: I can explain why hemp is considered an environmentally sustainable fibre
CODE: 3.6

WHAT (concept explanation):
Hemp reaches maturity in just 90-120 days (versus cotton's 150-180), requires about 50% less water than cotton, needs no pesticides due to natural pest resistance, and produces 2 times more fibre per hectare than cotton.

WHY (importance):
As sustainability becomes more important in textiles, understanding hemp's environmental advantages helps evaluate claims about eco-friendly fabrics.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Hemp was legalised for food in Australia in November 2017, with about 9,000 hectares cultivated in 2019-2020. Hemp fibre is 3-4 times stronger than cotton. The deep roots prevent erosion and can remove toxins from soil (phytoremediation).

SUBTOPIC: Natural Fibres: Animal and Plant
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers silk production and luxury animal fibres (cashmere, mohair, alpaca, angora), as well as plant fibres including cotton, linen, and hemp. You will learn about production processes, unique properties, and common misconceptions about bamboo fabric.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Natural fibres each have distinct properties that make them suitable for different applications. Understanding their production and characteristics helps you evaluate textile claims and make informed choices about fabric selection.

TOPIC: Fibre Production
SUBJECT: Textiles | YEAR LEVEL: Year 7
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Analyse how fibres are produced in managed environments, from natural sources like wool and cotton to synthetic manufacturing, and evaluate the sustainability challenges facing the textile industry.

# Fibre Production: From Farm and Factory to Fabric

## A Textbook for Year 7-8 Students | Victorian Curriculum VCDSTC046

---

# Welcome to Fibre Production

Look down at what you're wearing right now. Your school uniform, your socks, your jumper—every piece of clothing started as a raw material somewhere in the world. Maybe it was wool from a sheep on an Australian farm, cotton from a plant in Queensland, or polyester made from oil in a factory overseas.

In this unit, you'll discover where textile fibres come from and how they're transformed into the fabrics we wear every day. You'll learn about Australia's important role in global fibre production, how farmers and manufacturers manage their environments to produce quality fibres, and the environmental challenges facing the textile industry.

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to:
- Identify different types of natural and synthetic fibres and their sources
- Explain how fibres are produced in managed environments
- Describe the processing stages that transform raw fibres into textiles
- Analyse the sustainability challenges of different fibre types
- Make informed decisions about textile choices based on their properties and environmental impacts

Let's unravel the story of fibres.

# Chapter 1: Understanding Textile Fibres

## What Is a Fibre?

A **fibre** is a thin, thread-like strand that can be spun into yarn and then woven or knitted into fabric. Fibres are the basic building blocks of all textiles—from the t-shirt on your back to the carpet under your feet.

Fibres can be classified into three main categories based on where they come from:

### 1. Natural Fibres

These come directly from plants or animals and have been used for thousands of years.

**Animal fibres** include:
- Wool (from sheep)
- Silk (from silkworms)
- Alpaca, cashmere, mohair, angora (from various animals)

**Plant fibres** include:
- Cotton (from the cotton plant)
- Linen (from the flax plant)
- Hemp (from the hemp plant)
- Jute, sisal, bamboo

### 2. Synthetic Fibres

These are entirely human-made, usually from petroleum (crude oil) products. They're manufactured in factories through chemical processes.

**Examples include:**
- Polyester
- Nylon
- Acrylic

### 3. Semi-Synthetic (Regenerated) Fibres

These start with a natural material (usually wood pulp) but are chemically processed to create the fibre. They sit between natural and synthetic.

**Examples include:**
- Rayon/Viscose
- Lyocell (TENCEL™)
- Modal

---

## Staple Fibres vs Filament Fibres

Before we dive deeper, there's an important distinction to understand:

**Staple fibres** are short lengths of fibre (from a few centimetres to about 50cm) that must be twisted together (spun) to create a continuous yarn. Most natural fibres are staple fibres—cotton, wool, and linen all come in short pieces that need to be spun.

**Filament fibres** are very long continuous strands. Silk is the only natural filament fibre—a single silk cocoon produces 600-900 metres of unbroken thread! All synthetic fibres are produced as filaments (though they can be cut into staple lengths if desired).

---

## Why Fibre Properties Matter

Different fibres have different properties—characteristics that determine how they behave and what they're best used for. Understanding these properties helps designers and manufacturers choose the right fibre for each purpose.

Key properties include:

| Property | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Absorbency** | How much moisture the fibre can soak up | Affects comfort, drying time, stain resistance |
| **Strength** | How much force needed to break the fibre | Affects durability and wear resistance |
| **Elasticity** | How much it can stretch and return to shape | Affects comfort and shape retention |
| **Thermal properties** | How it conducts or insulates heat | Affects warmth and comfort in different climates |
| **Flammability** | How easily it catches fire | Affects safety, especially for children's wear |
| **Biodegradability** | How quickly it breaks down naturally | Affects environmental impact at end of life |

As we explore each fibre type, pay attention to these properties—they explain why certain fibres are chosen for specific uses.

# Chapter 2: Wool – Australia's Golden Fleece

Australia is one of the world's most important wool-producing nations. We produce about **25% of the world's apparel wool**—that's wool used for clothing rather than carpets. Understanding wool production helps you understand both Australia's agricultural history and how managed environments work.

---

## The Australian Wool Industry

Wool has been central to Australia's economy since the early colonial period. The first Merino sheep arrived in Australia in **1797**, and by **1870**, Australia had become the world's largest wool producer—a position we still hold today.

### Australia's Wool Industry by the Numbers

- **68.5 million sheep** across Australia
- **280 million kg** of greasy (unwashed) wool produced annually
- **99% exported**—mostly to China (82-86% of exports)
- Major wool-producing states: New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia

### The Merino Advantage

While there are many sheep breeds, the **Merino** is the most important for fine wool production. Merino wool is prized for being:
- Very fine (thin fibres)
- Soft against the skin
- Excellent for high-quality clothing

Different Merino strains suit different Australian environments:

| Merino Type | Fibre Fineness | Best Environment |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Saxon Merino | ≤20 microns (very fine) | High-rainfall areas |
| Peppin Merino | 21-22 microns | Wheat-sheep zones |
| South Australian Strongwool | 23-26 microns | Dry pastoral areas |

**What's a micron?** A micron (μm) is one-millionth of a metre. Human hair is about 70 microns thick, while the finest Merino wool can be as thin as 12 microns—so fine you can barely see a single fibre!

---

## From Sheep to Sweater: The Wool Production Process

Wool goes through many stages before it becomes the jumper in your wardrobe. Let's follow the journey:

### Stage 1: Shearing

**Shearing** is the removal of the sheep's fleece. In Australia, this happens once a year, usually in spring after the cold winter months.

Professional shearers use electric handpieces (like heavy-duty hair clippers) to remove the fleece in one piece. A skilled shearer can shear a sheep in just **2-3 minutes** and may shear 150-200 sheep per day.

The average fleece weighs about **4-5 kg**, but this will reduce significantly during processing as impurities are removed.

**Fun fact:** Sheep don't feel pain during shearing—it's like getting a haircut! Their wool grows continuously, so regular shearing is actually necessary for their health and comfort.

### Stage 2: Skirting and Classing

Once removed, the fleece is spread out on a large skirting table. Workers remove the lower-quality wool from the edges (belly wool, leg wool) and any heavily contaminated sections. This is called **skirting**.

A **wool classer** then grades the fleece based on:
- Fibre diameter (micron count)
- Staple length (how long the fibres are)
- Staple strength
- Vegetable matter content (seeds, burrs)
- Colour and condition

Different grades are separated and packed into wool bales (large compressed packages weighing about 180 kg each).

### Stage 3: Wool Auction

Most Australian wool is sold at auction through the **Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX)**. Buyers from around the world (mostly from China) bid on wool bales based on their specifications.

The **Eastern Market Indicator (EMI)** is the benchmark price for Australian wool, typically ranging from 1,100-1,550 cents per kilogram of clean wool.

### Stage 4: Scouring

Raw wool straight from the sheep is called **greasy wool** because it contains:
- **Lanolin** (wool grease/wax)—about 10-25% of the weight
- **Suint** (dried sweat)
- Dirt and dust
- Vegetable matter

**Scouring** is the washing process that removes these impurities. The wool passes through a series of large tanks containing water at **60-65°C** and detergent.

After scouring, the wool loses about **30% of its original weight**—all those impurities are gone! The recovered lanolin is valuable too—it's used in cosmetics and skincare products.

### Stage 5: Carding

**Carding** uses large cylinders covered in fine wire teeth to:
- Separate and untangle the fibres
- Remove any remaining vegetable matter
- Align fibres roughly parallel
- Form fibres into a soft rope called a **sliver**

### Stage 6: Combing (for Worsted Wool)

For the finest wool products, an additional **combing** step removes shorter fibres and makes all remaining fibres lie perfectly parallel. This produces **worsted wool**—used for smooth, fine fabrics like suit material.

Wool that skips this step becomes **woollen yarn**—loftier, softer, and used for things like knitting yarn and blankets.

### Stage 7: Spinning

**Spinning** twists the fibres together to create yarn. The twist holds the fibres in place and gives the yarn its strength.

- More twist = stronger, thinner yarn (good for weaving)
- Less twist = softer, loftier yarn (good for knitwear)

### Stage 8: Fabric Construction

Finally, yarn becomes fabric through either:
- **Weaving**: Interlacing two sets of yarns (warp and weft) at right angles on a loom
- **Knitting**: Interlocking loops of yarn together

---

## What Makes Wool Special?

Wool has some remarkable properties that make it valuable for certain uses:

### Moisture Management

Wool can absorb **30-35% of its own weight in moisture** without feeling wet to the touch. This is because wool fibres have a complex structure with a water-resistant outer layer and an absorbent inner core.

**Why this matters:** Wool clothing keeps you comfortable by absorbing sweat and releasing it slowly into the air. This is why wool is popular for activewear and outdoor clothing.

### Temperature Regulation

The natural **crimp** (waviness) in wool fibres creates millions of tiny air pockets. Air is an excellent insulator, so these pockets trap warmth in cold weather.

But wool also helps in warm weather—as moisture evaporates from wool, it creates a cooling effect.

**Why this matters:** Wool keeps you warm when it's cold and helps regulate temperature when it's warm. This is why Merino wool base layers are popular with hikers and athletes.

### Fire Resistance

Wool is naturally **fire-resistant**. It won't ignite until it reaches **570-600°C** (compare this to cotton, which ignites at just 255°C). Even more importantly, wool requires **25.2% oxygen** to burn, but our atmosphere only contains 21% oxygen—so wool struggles to sustain a flame.

When wool does burn, it tends to smoulder and self-extinguish rather than producing flames. It doesn't melt or drip like synthetic fibres.

**Why this matters:** Wool is used for aircraft seat covers, firefighter uniforms, and children's sleepwear because of its safety properties.

### Elasticity

Wool fibres can stretch up to **30% of their length** and spring back to their original shape. This natural elasticity helps wool garments resist wrinkling and maintain their shape.

### Natural Odour Resistance

The structure of wool fibres resists bacterial growth, meaning wool clothing stays fresher for longer between washes.

---

## Wool Quality and Grading

The value of wool depends primarily on its **micron count**—the diameter of the fibres measured in microns.

| Grade | Micron Range | Typical Use | Relative Value |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Ultrafine | <15.5 | Luxury fashion, next-to-skin | Highest |
| Superfine | 15.6-18.5 | High-end apparel | Very high |
| Fine | 18.6-20.5 | Quality suiting, knitwear | High |
| Medium | 20.6-23.5 | Outerwear, blankets | Medium |
| Strong/Broad | >23.5 | Carpets, industrial | Lower |

**Why finer is more valuable:** Finer fibres feel softer against the skin, drape better, and can be woven into lighter, more luxurious fabrics.

---

## The Woolmark System

You may have seen the **Woolmark** logo on clothing labels—a stylised ball of yarn that's one of the world's most recognised textile symbols.

Created in **1964**, the Woolmark is a certification system owned by **The Woolmark Company** (part of Australian Wool Innovation). Products must pass strict testing to carry the logo:

| Logo | Requirements |
|------|--------------|
| **Woolmark** | 100% pure new wool |
| **Woolmark Blend** | 50-99.9% new wool |
| **Wool Blend** | 30-49.9% new wool |

Products are tested for fibre content, colourfastness (colour doesn't fade), physical strength, and wash performance.

# Chapter 3: Other Animal Fibres

While wool dominates animal fibre production, several other animals provide valuable fibres with unique properties.

---

## Silk: Nature's Only Filament Fibre

Silk is one of the most luxurious and fascinating fibres in the world. It's the only natural fibre that comes as a continuous filament rather than short staple lengths.

### The Silkworm Lifecycle

Silk comes from the cocoon of the **Bombyx mori**—the domesticated silkworm (actually a caterpillar, not a worm!). The production of silk is called **sericulture**, and it follows a precise lifecycle:

**Stage 1: Egg (10-14 days)**
Female silk moths lay 300-500 tiny eggs, each about the size of a pinhead. The eggs are kept at controlled temperatures until they hatch.

**Stage 2: Larva/Caterpillar (23-28 days)**
The newly hatched silkworm is tiny—about 3mm long. Over the next month, it does nothing but eat mulberry leaves. And eat. And eat some more.

During this stage, the silkworm grows to **10,000 times its original size**—imagine if a human baby grew that much! It moults (sheds its skin) four times as it outgrows each skin.

**Stage 3: Cocoon Spinning (2-3 days)**
When fully grown (about 7.5cm long), the silkworm stops eating and begins spinning its cocoon. Moving its head in a figure-8 pattern, it produces a continuous silk filament from glands near its mouth.

A single silkworm produces **600-900 metres** of continuous silk thread in just 2-3 days!

**Stage 4: Pupa (2-3 weeks)**
Inside the cocoon, the silkworm transforms into a moth through metamorphosis.

### Harvesting Silk

Here's where silk production becomes controversial: to harvest the silk as one continuous filament, the cocoons must be collected **before the moth emerges**. If the moth breaks through the cocoon, it breaks the continuous filament into many short pieces, making the silk much less valuable.

Traditional silk production involves killing the pupa inside by:
- Heating the cocoons (sun-drying or steam)
- This also softens the **sericin** (silk gum) holding the filament together

The silk is then **reeled**—the filament from several cocoons (usually 4-8) is combined and wound together to create a usable thread.

**Scale of production:** It takes approximately **3,000 cocoons** to produce just 1 kg of silk, and **104 kg of mulberry leaves** to feed those silkworms!

### Silk Properties

Silk is prized for its:
- **Lustrous appearance**—it reflects light beautifully
- **Incredible strength**—stronger than steel of the same diameter
- **Excellent drape**—flows and hangs elegantly
- **Temperature regulation**—cool in summer, warm in winter
- **Hypoallergenic** qualities—good for sensitive skin

### Peace Silk (Ahimsa Silk)

Some producers now make **peace silk** or **Ahimsa silk**, which allows the moth to emerge naturally before harvesting the cocoon. This produces shorter fibres that must be spun like other staple fibres, resulting in a slightly different texture.

---

## Luxury Animal Fibres

### Cashmere

**Source:** The soft undercoat of cashmere goats, primarily from Mongolia, China, and Iran.

**What makes it special:** To be classified as cashmere, fibres must be **less than 19 microns** in diameter—even finer than most Merino wool. This extreme fineness gives cashmere its legendary softness.

**Production challenges:** Each goat produces only **150-200 grams** of cashmere per year (compared to 4-5 kg of wool per sheep). This scarcity, combined with the hand-combing required to collect it, makes cashmere expensive.

### Mohair

**Source:** The Angora goat (not to be confused with Angora fibre, which comes from rabbits!).

**What makes it special:** Mohair has exceptional lustre (shine), durability, and takes dye brilliantly. It's often blended with wool to add sheen and strength.

**Production:** Each Angora goat produces **3.6-7.3 kg** of mohair per year.

### Alpaca

**Source:** Alpacas, members of the camelid family native to South America. Australia now has a growing alpaca industry.

**What makes it special:** Alpaca fibre is **3-7 times warmer than sheep's wool** because the fibres are partially hollow, trapping more air. It also contains no lanolin, making it naturally hypoallergenic.

**Production:** Each alpaca produces **3-7 kg** of fibre per year.

### Angora

**Source:** Angora rabbits (remember: Angora rabbits give angora; Angora goats give mohair!).

**What makes it special:** Angora is **6 times warmer than wool** due to its hollow fibre structure. It's incredibly soft and lightweight.

**Production challenges:** Each rabbit produces only about **400 grams** per year, and the fibre must be carefully harvested by combing or shearing.

---

## Common Confusion Alert!

Students often confuse these terms:

| Term | Source Animal | Key Fact |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Angora** | Angora RABBIT | 6× warmer than wool |
| **Mohair** | Angora GOAT | High lustre, durable |

Remember: The fibre name and animal name don't always match!

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. Why is silk called a "filament fibre" while wool is a "staple fibre"?
2. How long is the silk filament from a single cocoon?
3. Why must silk cocoons be harvested before the moth emerges?
4. What is the maximum micron count for a fibre to be called cashmere?
5. Which animal does angora fibre come from? Which animal does mohair come from?

---

# Chapter 4: Plant Fibres

Plant fibres have been used for textiles for thousands of years. Cotton is by far the most important, but linen, hemp, and other fibres each have their own story and unique properties.

---

## Cotton: The World's Most Popular Natural Fibre

Cotton is everywhere. Look at the labels in your clothes—chances are most of them contain at least some cotton. Globally, cotton accounts for about **25% of all fibre production**.

### Australia's Cotton Industry

Australia is a significant cotton producer, with a unique story:

- **91% of Australian cotton** is grown in the Murray-Darling Basin (NSW and Queensland)
- Australia produces **4.4-5.5 million bales** annually (depending on water availability)
- Our yields are approximately **3 times the world average** due to advanced farming practices
- **Over 99%** of Australian cotton is exported, mainly to Southeast Asian textile mills

### How Cotton Grows

Cotton comes from plants in the genus *Gossypium*. The cotton "fibre" is actually the protective fluff surrounding the seeds inside the cotton boll (seed pod).

**The growing cycle (150-180 days):**

1. **Planting** (September-November in Australia)
   - Seeds need soil temperature of at least 15°C to germinate
   - Each seed produces a single plant

2. **Vegetative growth** (first 5-6 weeks)
   - Plants develop stems and leaves
   - Roots grow deep to access water

3. **Square formation** (~5 weeks after planting)
   - "Squares" are the flower buds
   - Plants begin reproductive phase

4. **Flowering** (~8 weeks after planting)
   - Flowers open white/cream coloured
   - After pollination, they turn pink then red
   - Each flower produces one boll

5. **Boll development** (50-55 days after flowering)
   - Inside each boll, 32-40 seeds develop
   - Each seed grows thousands of fibres
   - Fibres are almost pure cellulose (plant material)

6. **Boll opening** (maturity)
   - Bolls dry and split open, revealing white cotton
   - A healthy plant may have 100-120 bolls
   - Each boll contains about 500,000 individual fibres!

7. **Harvest** (March-May in Australia)
   - Defoliants remove leaves to ease picking
   - Mechanical harvesters collect the cotton
   - "Seed cotton" includes fibres, seeds, and trash

### Processing: From Field to Fibre

**Ginning** is the critical first step—separating the cotton fibres from the seeds.

When seed cotton enters the gin:
- **35-42%** becomes lint (the usable fibre)
- **48-55%** is cottonseed (used for oil and animal feed)
- **3-10%** is trash and waste

The lint is then compressed into bales weighing about 227 kg each.

**Subsequent processing** follows similar steps to wool:
1. **Opening and cleaning**—loosening compressed bales, removing remaining debris
2. **Carding**—aligning fibres into a sliver
3. **Combing** (optional)—for finer cotton, removes short fibres
4. **Drawing**—combines and stretches slivers for uniformity
5. **Spinning**—twists fibres into yarn
6. **Weaving or knitting**—creates fabric

### Cotton's Unique Properties

Cotton has some properties that make it ideal for everyday clothing:

**Absorbency:** Cotton can absorb **24-27 times its own weight** in water. This makes it comfortable to wear because it absorbs sweat from your skin.

**Strength when wet:** Here's something surprising—unlike most fibres, cotton actually gets **STRONGER when wet**, increasing in strength by **20-25%**. This is why cotton can withstand repeated washing without falling apart.

**Why does cotton get stronger wet?** Water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the cellulose in cotton fibres, actually helping hold them together more tightly!

**Breathability:** Cotton's structure allows air to circulate, keeping you cool.

**Biodegradability:** As a natural cellulose fibre, cotton breaks down relatively quickly—**1 week to 5 months** depending on conditions.

**Drawbacks:** Cotton wrinkles easily, dries slowly, and can shrink when washed.

---

## Linen: Ancient Luxury

Linen is made from the fibres of the **flax plant** (*Linum usitatissimum*). It's one of the oldest textile fibres—evidence of linen fabric dates back over 30,000 years!

### Why Australia Doesn't Grow Flax

Australia has no significant linen production because flax needs:
- Cool, moist climates
- Specific soil conditions
- Labour-intensive harvesting

Most linen comes from Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe.

### The Retting Process

The key step in linen production is **retting**—using controlled bacterial decomposition to break down the pectin (plant glue) that binds fibres to the woody stem.

**Dew retting:** Flax stalks are spread in fields for about 3 weeks. Morning dew and bacteria gradually break down the pectin. This produces silver/grey coloured fibres.

**Water retting:** Stalks are submerged in water for 10-30 days. Faster and more controlled, but requires careful monitoring—over-retting damages the fibres; under-retting makes them impossible to separate.

After retting:
- **Scutching** beats the stalks to remove woody pieces
- **Hackling** combs out the fibres and separates long "line" fibres from short "tow" fibres

### Linen Properties

Linen is valued for:

**Exceptional strength:** Linen is **2-3 times stronger than cotton** and one of the strongest natural fibres available.

**Durability:** Linen products can last **up to 30 years** with proper care—the fibres actually get softer and more comfortable with age and washing.

**Cool comfort:** Linen conducts heat very well, carrying warmth away from your body. This is why linen clothing feels so cool in summer.

**Quick drying:** Linen absorbs moisture well but releases it quickly.

**Sustainability:** Linen is highly biodegradable—it can break down in just a **few weeks** when buried in soil.

**Drawbacks:** Linen wrinkles easily (those wrinkles are considered part of its character!), is more expensive than cotton, and has limited elasticity.

---

## Hemp: The Sustainable Superstar

Hemp (*Cannabis sativa*) is gaining attention as one of the most sustainable fibre options available. Don't worry—industrial hemp is not the same as marijuana, even though they're related plants.

### Hemp in Australia

Hemp farming has a complicated history in Australia due to its relationship with cannabis. However, industrial hemp (which contains less than **0.35-1% THC** depending on state regulations) was legalised for food in **November 2017**, and fibre production is regulated by each state.

About **9,000 hectares** were cultivated in Australia in 2019-2020, with growing interest from farmers and textile companies.

### Why Hemp Is Considered Sustainable

Hemp has remarkable environmental credentials:

**Fast growth:** Hemp reaches maturity in just **90-120 days** (compare to cotton's 150-180 days).

**Low water needs:** Hemp requires about **50% less water** than cotton.

**No pesticides needed:** Hemp naturally resists most pests and diseases.

**High yield:** Hemp produces **2 times more fibre per hectare** than cotton.

**Soil improvement:** Hemp's deep roots prevent erosion and can even help remove toxins from contaminated soil (a process called phytoremediation).

**Carbon capture:** Hemp absorbs large amounts of CO₂ as it grows.

### Hemp Fibre Properties

Hemp produces some of the strongest natural fibres available:

- **3-4 times stronger than cotton**
- Excellent durability and abrasion resistance
- Gets softer with washing
- Naturally resistant to mould and UV light
- Highly breathable
- Biodegradable

**Drawbacks:** Hemp processing is labour-intensive, the fabric can feel rough initially, and limited processing infrastructure currently exists in Australia.

## The Bamboo Misconception

You've probably seen "bamboo" clothing advertised as natural and eco-friendly. Here's something important you need to know:

**Most "bamboo fabric" is actually rayon/viscose made FROM bamboo—not actual bamboo fibre.**

### What's Really Happening

True bamboo linen—made by mechanically processing bamboo stalks—does exist but is:
- Rare
- Rough in texture
- Expensive to produce

The soft "bamboo" clothing commonly sold in stores is made by:
1. Dissolving bamboo pulp in harsh chemicals (sodium hydroxide, carbon disulfide)
2. Extruding the solution through spinnerets to create fibres
3. The result is rayon/viscose—a semi-synthetic fibre

**The problem:** After this chemical processing, **no trace of the original bamboo properties remains**. The resulting fibre is chemically identical to rayon made from any other plant source.

The US Federal Trade Commission requires such products to be labelled as "rayon made from bamboo" rather than simply "bamboo."

**Why this matters:** Some companies market bamboo rayon as "eco-friendly" because bamboo grows quickly without pesticides. However, the chemical processing involved can be highly polluting, potentially cancelling out those environmental benefits.

Synthetic fibres are entirely human-made, typically from petroleum (crude oil) products. They've revolutionised the textile industry since their invention in the 20th century, offering properties that natural fibres can't match.

---

## How Synthetic Fibres Are Made

All synthetic fibres are created through a similar basic process:

1. **Polymerisation:** Chemicals derived from petroleum are reacted together to form long-chain molecules called polymers.

2. **Melting or dissolving:** The polymer is melted or dissolved into a thick, syrup-like liquid.

3. **Extrusion:** The liquid is forced through a **spinneret**—a metal plate with tiny holes (like a showerhead, but with holes just 0.05-0.1mm in diameter).

4. **Solidification:** The fibres solidify as they emerge from the spinneret (by cooling, evaporation, or chemical reaction).

5. **Drawing:** The fibres are stretched to align the polymer molecules, increasing strength.

6. **Texturising (optional):** Fibres can be crimped, curled, or otherwise modified to change their properties.

The shape of the spinneret holes determines the fibre's cross-section:
- Round holes → standard fibres
- Triangular holes → fibres with enhanced lustre
- Hollow centres → fibres with better insulation

Because synthetic fibres are manufactured, their properties can be precisely controlled by adjusting the chemicals used, hole shapes, and processing conditions.

## Polyester: The Dominant Fibre

Polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, or PET) is the most widely used fibre in the world, accounting for about **57% of global fibre production**.

### How Polyester Is Made

Polyester production uses **melt spinning** at high temperatures (**260-270°C**):

1. Chemicals react at 150-210°C to form polyester polymer
2. Molten polyester is extruded, cooled, and cut into small chips
3. Chips are remelted to a syrup-like consistency
4. The liquid is forced through spinneret holes
5. Emerging fibres are cooled by air
6. Fibres are stretched **up to 5 times** their original length to align molecules

### Polyester Properties

**Advantages:**
- Very low moisture absorption (**0.4-1%**)—dries quickly
- Wrinkle resistant—holds its shape well
- Strong and durable
- Resistant to stretching and shrinking
- Easy to care for (machine washable, quick drying)
- Takes colour well
- Inexpensive to produce

**Disadvantages:**
- Not breathable—can feel hot and clammy
- Can hold body odours
- Static electricity buildup
- Derived from non-renewable petroleum
- **Non-biodegradable: takes 20-200 years to decompose**
- Releases microplastic fibres when washed

### Recycled Polyester (rPET)

Polyester can be made from recycled plastic bottles (PET bottles). This **recycled polyester (rPET)** offers significant environmental benefits:
- Reduces plastic waste going to landfill
- Uses **59-79% less energy** than virgin polyester
- Produces fewer carbon emissions

**However, there's a catch:** Research shows that recycled polyester may actually release **more microplastic fibres** during washing than virgin polyester, because the recycled fibres are often shorter and weaker.

---

## Nylon: The First Synthetic Fibre

Nylon holds a special place in textile history as the **first fully synthetic fibre**. It was invented on **February 28, 1935** by Wallace Carothers at DuPont in the USA.

When nylon stockings went on sale in 1940, they caused a sensation—stores sold out within hours, and "nylon riots" occurred as women fought to buy them!

### Nylon Properties

- **Extremely strong:** Stronger than steel of the same diameter
- **Excellent elasticity:** Stretches and recovers well
- **Abrasion resistant:** Stands up to friction and wear
- **Lightweight:** Despite its strength
- **Quick drying:** Low moisture absorption
- **Smooth:** Soft feel against skin

**Disadvantages:**
- Can feel hot in warm weather
- Sensitive to UV light (degrades in sunlight)
- Static buildup
- Made from petroleum
- Takes **30-40 years** to decompose

### Common Uses

Nylon's strength and elasticity make it ideal for:
- Hosiery (stockings, tights)
- Activewear and swimwear
- Parachutes
- Ropes and fishing nets
- Toothbrush bristles
- Carpet fibres

---

## Acrylic: The Wool Substitute

Acrylic was developed as a cheaper alternative to wool. By definition, acrylic fibres contain at least **85% acrylonitrile** (a petroleum-derived chemical).

### Acrylic Properties

**Advantages:**
- Wool-like warmth and softness
- Lightweight
- Resistant to moths (unlike wool)
- Holds colour well
- Relatively inexpensive
- Machine washable

**Disadvantages:**
- Pills easily (forms little balls on the surface)
- Not as warm as real wool
- Static buildup
- Not breathable
- Non-biodegradable (takes **~200 years** to decompose)
- **Releases the most microplastic fibres of any synthetic**

### The Microplastic Problem

Acrylic has a significant environmental issue: it releases approximately **730,000 microplastic fibres per wash**—about **5 times more** than polyester-cotton blends.

These tiny plastic particles are too small for washing machine filters to catch, so they flow into waterways and eventually the ocean.

---

## The Semi-Synthetic Category: Rayon and Lyocell

Some fibres don't fit neatly into "natural" or "synthetic" categories. **Rayon** (also called viscose) and **lyocell** are made from natural materials (wood pulp) but through chemical processing. They're called **semi-synthetic** or **regenerated cellulose** fibres.

### Traditional Viscose/Rayon

Viscose was developed in the late 1800s as a cheaper alternative to silk. The process:

1. Wood pulp (usually from eucalyptus, beech, or pine) is treated with **17.5% sodium hydroxide** (caustic soda)
2. The mixture is reacted with **carbon disulfide** (a toxic chemical)
3. The resulting "viscose" solution is extruded through spinnerets into a **sulfuric acid bath**
4. The cellulose regenerates as solid fibres

**The problem:** This process uses toxic chemicals and produces significant pollution. Carbon disulfide is hazardous to workers and the environment.

### Lyocell (TENCEL™): The Cleaner Alternative

Lyocell (branded as TENCEL™ by Lenzing) uses a much more sustainable **closed-loop process**:

1. Wood pulp is dissolved in a non-toxic solvent called NMMO
2. The solution is extruded through spinnerets
3. **99.8% of the solvent is recovered and recycled**
4. Much less water and energy are used

Lyocell fibres are:
- Strong (stronger than cotton when wet)
- Breathable
- Soft and smooth
- Biodegradable (**55 days** in soil)
- More sustainable than viscose

## Comparing Synthetic Fibres

| Fibre | Made From | Key Property | Decomposition Time |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Polyester | Petroleum | Quick-drying, wrinkle-resistant | 20-200 years |
| Nylon | Petroleum | Extremely strong, elastic | 30-40 years |
| Acrylic | Petroleum | Wool-like warmth | ~200 years |
| Rayon/Viscose | Wood pulp | Silk-like drape | Months-years |
| Lyocell | Wood pulp | Strong, sustainable | ~55 days |

# Chapter 6: Managed Environments for Fibre Production

The Victorian Curriculum asks you to understand how fibres are produced in **managed environments**. But what exactly does this mean?

---

## What Is a Managed Environment?

A **managed environment** is a production system where humans control key factors to optimise outcomes. In fibre production, this includes:

- **Selecting breeds/varieties** suited to local conditions
- **Controlling inputs** (water, nutrients, pest management)
- **Managing timing** (planting, harvesting)
- **Using technology** to monitor and improve production
- **Applying quality standards** throughout the process

Managed environments exist on a spectrum—from extensive sheep stations where management is relatively light-touch, to intensive cotton farms with precise irrigation control, to factory settings for synthetic fibre production.

---

## Managed Environments: Wool Production

Australian sheep stations represent managed grazing environments. Key management practices include:

### Breed Selection

Farmers choose sheep breeds suited to their specific conditions:
- Fine-wool Merinos for higher-rainfall areas
- Stronger-wool breeds for harsh pastoral zones
- Crossbreeds for dual-purpose (wool and meat) production

### Pasture Management

- **Rotational grazing:** Moving sheep between paddocks to allow pastures to recover
- **Stocking rates:** Adjusting sheep numbers based on available feed
- **Supplementary feeding:** Providing additional nutrition during drought or when pastures are poor

### Water Management

- Installing bores (wells) and dams
- Creating watering points throughout properties
- Managing water distribution during dry periods

### Health Management

- Vaccination programs
- Parasite control (drenching)
- Shearing timing for animal welfare
- Managing flystrike (a significant welfare and economic issue)

### Technology Integration

Modern wool production increasingly uses:
- GPS tracking of livestock
- Drones for monitoring pastures and animals
- Weather stations for decision-making
- Digital platforms like WoolClip for recording fleece specifications

---

## Managed Environments: Cotton Production

Cotton farming involves more intensive management than wool production:

### Climate Requirements

Cotton needs:
- Long, hot growing season (150+ frost-free days)
- Minimum soil temperature of 15°C for germination
- Adequate water during key growth stages
- Dry conditions for harvest

In Australia, this limits cotton production primarily to northern NSW and Queensland.

### Water Management

Water is the critical management factor for Australian cotton. Methods include:

**Furrow irrigation:** Water flows down channels between crop rows
**Centre-pivot irrigation:** Rotating sprinkler systems
**Drip irrigation:** Water delivered directly to plant roots (most efficient)

Cotton farms typically use **6-8 megalitres per hectare** per season. The industry has improved water-use efficiency by about **40% since 1992** through better management and technology.

### Pest Management

Cotton plants are vulnerable to many pests. Australian cotton farmers use **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:

- **Monitoring:** Regular scouting and trapping to track pest populations
- **Biological control:** Encouraging beneficial insects that eat pests
- **Genetic resistance:** Planting varieties with built-in pest resistance
- **Targeted spraying:** Using pesticides only when necessary and in specific areas

### Harvest Timing

Getting harvest timing right is crucial:
- Too early: Immature fibres reduce quality
- Too late: Weather damage, increased trash
- Defoliation: Chemical removal of leaves 2-3 weeks before picking to ease mechanical harvest

### Quality Assurance: myBMP

Cotton Australia runs the **myBMP (Best Management Practices)** program. Certified farms must meet **over 300 criteria** covering:
- Water management
- Pest management
- Soil health
- Employee safety
- Environmental protection

About **30%** of Australian cotton is fully certified under this program.

---

## Managed Environments: Synthetic Fibre Production

Factory production represents the most controlled managed environment:

### Controlled Conditions

Synthetic fibre factories maintain precise control over:
- **Temperature:** Specific temperatures for each production stage
- **Chemical concentrations:** Exact formulations for consistent results
- **Air quality:** Clean room conditions for some processes
- **Humidity:** Affects fibre properties during formation

### Quality Control

Modern synthetic fibre production includes:
- Continuous monitoring of fibre diameter
- Testing of tensile strength
- Colour consistency measurement
- Detection of defects

### Automation

Most synthetic fibre production is highly automated:
- Computer-controlled processes
- Minimal human intervention
- Consistent output quality
- 24/7 operation capability

2. How do wool farmers manage their pastures sustainably?
3. Why is water management so critical for Australian cotton production?
4. What is Integrated Pest Management (IPM)?
5. How does a synthetic fibre factory differ from a sheep station in terms of environmental control?

---

# Chapter 7: Sustainability in Fibre Production

Every fibre—whether natural or synthetic—has environmental impacts. Understanding these impacts helps you make informed choices as a consumer and evaluate claims about "sustainable" textiles.

---

## Water Footprint

Different fibres require vastly different amounts of water to produce:

| Fibre | Water Use (litres per kg) | Context |
|-------|---------------------------|---------|
| Conventional cotton | 8,000-20,000 | One t-shirt ≈ 2,700 litres |
| Organic cotton | 243-2,000 | Up to 91% reduction |
| Hemp | 2,000-3,400 | ~50% less than conventional cotton |
| Linen | ~6,000 | Flax needs less irrigation |
| Wool | 500-800 | Plus processing water |
| Polyester | 60-100 | But uses petroleum instead |

**Important context about cotton:** The often-quoted figure of 10,000-20,000 litres per kg includes **all water** the cotton plant uses—including rainfall. About **73-75%** of cotton's water footprint comes from rain that would fall anyway, not irrigation.

Australian cotton is relatively efficient, producing more fibre per megalitre of irrigation water than most other countries due to advanced farming practices.

---

## Carbon Footprint

All fibre production generates greenhouse gas emissions:

### Natural Fibre Emissions

**Wool:** Surprisingly, wool has a relatively high carbon footprint of **19-25 kg CO₂e per kg** of fibre. About **50%** of this comes from sheep belching methane (yes, really!). Sheep produce approximately **30 litres of methane per day** through their digestive process.

**Cotton:** About **5.34 kg CO₂e per kg**—lower than wool, mainly from farming operations, fertiliser production, and processing.

### Synthetic Fibre Emissions

**Polyester:** About **5.5-9.5 kg CO₂e per kg** from petroleum extraction, chemical processing, and manufacturing.

**Recycled polyester:** **79% lower** emissions than virgin polyester because it uses existing plastic rather than extracting new petroleum.

---

## Pesticide Use

Cotton has historically been called "the world's dirtiest crop" because it uses a disproportionate amount of pesticides:

- Cotton uses approximately **6% of the world's pesticides**
- But cotton only covers about **2.4% of global cropland**
- Pesticides can pollute waterways and harm beneficial insects

**However, the Australian situation is different:**
- Australian cotton uses far fewer pesticides than the global average
- Genetically modified cotton varieties (about 99% of Australian cotton) have built-in pest resistance
- Integrated Pest Management has significantly reduced chemical use
- The myBMP program requires responsible pesticide use

**Organic cotton** uses no synthetic pesticides but may require more water and land to produce the same amount of fibre.

---

## Microplastic Pollution

This is one of the most significant environmental issues facing synthetic textiles.

### What Are Microplastics?

Microplastics are tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size. When you wash synthetic clothing, friction releases microscopic fibres that are too small for washing machine filters or water treatment plants to catch.

### The Scale of the Problem

- Synthetic textiles contribute **35% of ocean microplastics**
- A single wash can release **640,000-1,500,000 microfibres**
- Acrylic releases the most: ~730,000 fibres per wash
- Polyester fleece releases about 7,360 fibres per square metre per litre of water

These microplastics:
- Enter waterways and oceans
- Are consumed by marine life
- Enter the food chain
- Have been found in drinking water, food, and even human blood

### What Can Be Done?

- Use a **Guppyfriend washing bag** or **Cora Ball** to catch microfibres
- Wash synthetic clothing less frequently
- Use shorter, cooler wash cycles
- Choose natural fibres when possible
- Support development of biodegradable synthetics

---

## Biodegradability

How long does it take for different fibres to break down at end of life?

| Fibre | Decomposition Time | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Linen | 2 weeks - few months | Most biodegradable common fibre |
| Cotton | 1 week - 5 months | Depends on conditions |
| Hemp | Similar to linen | Highly biodegradable |
| Wool | 1-5 years | Depends on conditions |
| Silk | Similar to wool | Natural protein fibre |
| Lyocell | ~55 days | Regenerated cellulose |
| Nylon | 30-40 years | Synthetic |
| Polyester | 20-200 years | Non-biodegradable |
| Acrylic | ~200 years | Non-biodegradable |

**Why this matters:** The fashion industry produces about **92 million tonnes** of textile waste globally each year. If those textiles are synthetic, they'll remain in landfill for generations.

---

## The Mulesing Controversy

**Mulesing** is a surgical procedure performed on Merino sheep in Australia to prevent flystrike (blowfly infestation). It involves removing skin from around the tail area to create scar tissue that doesn't attract flies.

### The Issue

- Mulesing has been standard practice in Australia for decades
- It protects sheep from the often-fatal suffering of flystrike
- However, it causes pain and distress to the animals
- Animal welfare groups have campaigned against it
- Some international buyers now refuse mulesed wool

### Current Situation

- About **70%** of Australian Merino sheep are mulesed
- Victoria requires mandatory pain relief during the procedure
- The **National Wool Declaration** allows growers to declare mulesing status
- About **17%** of Australian wool is now sold as "non-mulesed"
- Research continues into alternatives, including breeding for "plain-bodied" sheep that don't require mulesing

---

## Textile Waste and the Circular Economy

### The Problem

The current textile system is mostly **linear**: resources are extracted → products are made → products are used → products are thrown away.

**Sobering statistics:**
- Australians discard approximately **23 kg of textiles per person per year** to landfill
- Australia is the **2nd highest textile consumer per capita** globally
- Global textile-to-textile recycling achieves **less than 1%**—virtually no clothing is being made into new clothing
- The average garment is worn only **7-10 times** before being discarded

### Circular Economy Solutions

A **circular economy** keeps materials in use as long as possible through:

**Design for longevity:** Creating quality items that last
**Design for recyclability:** Using single fibres rather than blends (blends are very difficult to recycle)
**Repair and reuse:** Extending product life through mending
**Resale and donation:** Giving items second (or third, or fourth) lives
**Recycling:** Converting old textiles into new fibres

### Current Initiatives

- **Better Cotton Initiative (BCI):** Trains farmers in sustainable practices; accounts for ~23% of global cotton
- **Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS):** Certifies organic fibre products
- **Responsible Wool Standard:** Ensures animal welfare standards (prohibits mulesing)
- **Textile recycling programs:** Some brands now accept old clothing for recycling

---

## Making Sustainable Choices

As a consumer, you can consider:

1. **Buy less, choose well:** Quality over quantity
2. **Choose natural fibres when possible:** They biodegrade at end of life
3. **Consider fibre blends carefully:** 100% cotton is easier to recycle than cotton-polyester blends
4. **Look for certifications:** GOTS, Better Cotton, Responsible Wool Standard
5. **Care for your clothes:** Proper care extends life
6. **Wash synthetic items carefully:** Less frequent, cooler washes reduce microplastic release
7. **Donate or resell:** Extend the useful life of items
8. **Support circular fashion:** Choose brands committed to sustainability

# Chapter 8: Putting It All Together

## Comparing Fibre Properties

| Property | Cotton | Wool | Polyester | Nylon |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| Source | Plant | Animal | Petroleum | Petroleum |
| Absorbency | High | High | Very low | Low |
| Strength (dry) | Medium | Low-medium | High | Very high |
| Strength (wet) | HIGHER | Lower | Same | Same |
| Warmth | Low | High | Medium | Low |
| Wrinkle resistance | Low | Medium | High | Medium |
| Biodegradable | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Fire resistant | No | Yes | No | No |
| Typical use | T-shirts, jeans | Suits, knitwear | Activewear | Hosiery, swimwear |

---

## Why Fibres Are Blended

Many fabrics contain **blends** of two or more fibres to combine beneficial properties:

**Cotton-polyester (polycotton):** Cotton's comfort and absorbency + polyester's durability and wrinkle resistance

**Wool-nylon:** Wool's warmth and comfort + nylon's strength and abrasion resistance (common in socks)

**Cotton-elastane (spandex):** Cotton's comfort + elastane's stretch (common in jeans)

**Wool-acrylic:** Wool's warmth + acrylic's lower cost and easy care

**The trade-off:** Blended fabrics are much harder to recycle because separating the different fibres is technically difficult and expensive.

TITLE: I can explain why hemp is considered an environmentally sustainable fibre
CODE: 3.6

WHAT (concept explanation):
Hemp reaches maturity in just 90-120 days (versus cotton's 150-180), requires about 50% less water than cotton, needs no pesticides due to natural pest resistance, and produces 2 times more fibre per hectare than cotton.

WHY (importance):
As sustainability becomes more important in textiles, understanding hemp's environmental advantages helps evaluate claims about eco-friendly fabrics.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Hemp was legalised for food in Australia in November 2017, with about 9,000 hectares cultivated in 2019-2020. Hemp fibre is 3-4 times stronger than cotton. The deep roots prevent erosion and can remove toxins from soil (phytoremediation).

SUBTOPIC: Natural Fibres: Animal and Plant
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers silk production and luxury animal fibres (cashmere, mohair, alpaca, angora), as well as plant fibres including cotton, linen, and hemp. You will learn about production processes, unique properties, and common misconceptions about bamboo fabric.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Natural fibres each have distinct properties that make them suitable for different applications. Understanding their production and characteristics helps you evaluate textile claims and make informed choices about fabric selection.

TOPIC: Fibre Production
SUBJECT: Textiles | YEAR LEVEL: Year 7
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Analyse how fibres are produced in managed environments, from natural sources like wool and cotton to synthetic manufacturing, and evaluate the sustainability challenges facing the textile industry.

# Fibre Production: From Farm and Factory to Fabric

## A Textbook for Year 7-8 Students | Victorian Curriculum VCDSTC046

---

# Welcome to Fibre Production

Look down at what you're wearing right now. Your school uniform, your socks, your jumper—every piece of clothing started as a raw material somewhere in the world. Maybe it was wool from a sheep on an Australian farm, cotton from a plant in Queensland, or polyester made from oil in a factory overseas.

In this unit, you'll discover where textile fibres come from and how they're transformed into the fabrics we wear every day. You'll learn about Australia's important role in global fibre production, how farmers and manufacturers manage their environments to produce quality fibres, and the environmental challenges facing the textile industry.

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to:
- Identify different types of natural and synthetic fibres and their sources
- Explain how fibres are produced in managed environments
- Describe the processing stages that transform raw fibres into textiles
- Analyse the sustainability challenges of different fibre types
- Make informed decisions about textile choices based on their properties and environmental impacts

Let's unravel the story of fibres.

# Chapter 1: Understanding Textile Fibres

## What Is a Fibre?

A **fibre** is a thin, thread-like strand that can be spun into yarn and then woven or knitted into fabric. Fibres are the basic building blocks of all textiles—from the t-shirt on your back to the carpet under your feet.

Fibres can be classified into three main categories based on where they come from:

### 1. Natural Fibres

These come directly from plants or animals and have been used for thousands of years.

**Animal fibres** include:
- Wool (from sheep)
- Silk (from silkworms)
- Alpaca, cashmere, mohair, angora (from various animals)

**Plant fibres** include:
- Cotton (from the cotton plant)
- Linen (from the flax plant)
- Hemp (from the hemp plant)
- Jute, sisal, bamboo

### 2. Synthetic Fibres

These are entirely human-made, usually from petroleum (crude oil) products. They're manufactured in factories through chemical processes.

**Examples include:**
- Polyester
- Nylon
- Acrylic

### 3. Semi-Synthetic (Regenerated) Fibres

These start with a natural material (usually wood pulp) but are chemically processed to create the fibre. They sit between natural and synthetic.

**Examples include:**
- Rayon/Viscose
- Lyocell (TENCEL™)
- Modal

---

## Staple Fibres vs Filament Fibres

Before we dive deeper, there's an important distinction to understand:

**Staple fibres** are short lengths of fibre (from a few centimetres to about 50cm) that must be twisted together (spun) to create a continuous yarn. Most natural fibres are staple fibres—cotton, wool, and linen all come in short pieces that need to be spun.

**Filament fibres** are very long continuous strands. Silk is the only natural filament fibre—a single silk cocoon produces 600-900 metres of unbroken thread! All synthetic fibres are produced as filaments (though they can be cut into staple lengths if desired).

---

## Why Fibre Properties Matter

Different fibres have different properties—characteristics that determine how they behave and what they're best used for. Understanding these properties helps designers and manufacturers choose the right fibre for each purpose.

Key properties include:

| Property | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Absorbency** | How much moisture the fibre can soak up | Affects comfort, drying time, stain resistance |
| **Strength** | How much force needed to break the fibre | Affects durability and wear resistance |
| **Elasticity** | How much it can stretch and return to shape | Affects comfort and shape retention |
| **Thermal properties** | How it conducts or insulates heat | Affects warmth and comfort in different climates |
| **Flammability** | How easily it catches fire | Affects safety, especially for children's wear |
| **Biodegradability** | How quickly it breaks down naturally | Affects environmental impact at end of life |

As we explore each fibre type, pay attention to these properties—they explain why certain fibres are chosen for specific uses.

# Chapter 2: Wool – Australia's Golden Fleece

Australia is one of the world's most important wool-producing nations. We produce about **25% of the world's apparel wool**—that's wool used for clothing rather than carpets. Understanding wool production helps you understand both Australia's agricultural history and how managed environments work.

---

## The Australian Wool Industry

Wool has been central to Australia's economy since the early colonial period. The first Merino sheep arrived in Australia in **1797**, and by **1870**, Australia had become the world's largest wool producer—a position we still hold today.

### Australia's Wool Industry by the Numbers

- **68.5 million sheep** across Australia
- **280 million kg** of greasy (unwashed) wool produced annually
- **99% exported**—mostly to China (82-86% of exports)
- Major wool-producing states: New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia

### The Merino Advantage

While there are many sheep breeds, the **Merino** is the most important for fine wool production. Merino wool is prized for being:
- Very fine (thin fibres)
- Soft against the skin
- Excellent for high-quality clothing

Different Merino strains suit different Australian environments:

| Merino Type | Fibre Fineness | Best Environment |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Saxon Merino | ≤20 microns (very fine) | High-rainfall areas |
| Peppin Merino | 21-22 microns | Wheat-sheep zones |
| South Australian Strongwool | 23-26 microns | Dry pastoral areas |

**What's a micron?** A micron (μm) is one-millionth of a metre. Human hair is about 70 microns thick, while the finest Merino wool can be as thin as 12 microns—so fine you can barely see a single fibre!

---

## From Sheep to Sweater: The Wool Production Process

Wool goes through many stages before it becomes the jumper in your wardrobe. Let's follow the journey:

### Stage 1: Shearing

**Shearing** is the removal of the sheep's fleece. In Australia, this happens once a year, usually in spring after the cold winter months.

Professional shearers use electric handpieces (like heavy-duty hair clippers) to remove the fleece in one piece. A skilled shearer can shear a sheep in just **2-3 minutes** and may shear 150-200 sheep per day.

The average fleece weighs about **4-5 kg**, but this will reduce significantly during processing as impurities are removed.

**Fun fact:** Sheep don't feel pain during shearing—it's like getting a haircut! Their wool grows continuously, so regular shearing is actually necessary for their health and comfort.

### Stage 2: Skirting and Classing

Once removed, the fleece is spread out on a large skirting table. Workers remove the lower-quality wool from the edges (belly wool, leg wool) and any heavily contaminated sections. This is called **skirting**.

A **wool classer** then grades the fleece based on:
- Fibre diameter (micron count)
- Staple length (how long the fibres are)
- Staple strength
- Vegetable matter content (seeds, burrs)
- Colour and condition

Different grades are separated and packed into wool bales (large compressed packages weighing about 180 kg each).

### Stage 3: Wool Auction

Most Australian wool is sold at auction through the **Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX)**. Buyers from around the world (mostly from China) bid on wool bales based on their specifications.

The **Eastern Market Indicator (EMI)** is the benchmark price for Australian wool, typically ranging from 1,100-1,550 cents per kilogram of clean wool.

### Stage 4: Scouring

Raw wool straight from the sheep is called **greasy wool** because it contains:
- **Lanolin** (wool grease/wax)—about 10-25% of the weight
- **Suint** (dried sweat)
- Dirt and dust
- Vegetable matter

**Scouring** is the washing process that removes these impurities. The wool passes through a series of large tanks containing water at **60-65°C** and detergent.

After scouring, the wool loses about **30% of its original weight**—all those impurities are gone! The recovered lanolin is valuable too—it's used in cosmetics and skincare products.

### Stage 5: Carding

**Carding** uses large cylinders covered in fine wire teeth to:
- Separate and untangle the fibres
- Remove any remaining vegetable matter
- Align fibres roughly parallel
- Form fibres into a soft rope called a **sliver**

### Stage 6: Combing (for Worsted Wool)

For the finest wool products, an additional **combing** step removes shorter fibres and makes all remaining fibres lie perfectly parallel. This produces **worsted wool**—used for smooth, fine fabrics like suit material.

Wool that skips this step becomes **woollen yarn**—loftier, softer, and used for things like knitting yarn and blankets.

### Stage 7: Spinning

**Spinning** twists the fibres together to create yarn. The twist holds the fibres in place and gives the yarn its strength.

- More twist = stronger, thinner yarn (good for weaving)
- Less twist = softer, loftier yarn (good for knitwear)

### Stage 8: Fabric Construction

Finally, yarn becomes fabric through either:
- **Weaving**: Interlacing two sets of yarns (warp and weft) at right angles on a loom
- **Knitting**: Interlocking loops of yarn together

---

## What Makes Wool Special?

Wool has some remarkable properties that make it valuable for certain uses:

### Moisture Management

Wool can absorb **30-35% of its own weight in moisture** without feeling wet to the touch. This is because wool fibres have a complex structure with a water-resistant outer layer and an absorbent inner core.

**Why this matters:** Wool clothing keeps you comfortable by absorbing sweat and releasing it slowly into the air. This is why wool is popular for activewear and outdoor clothing.

### Temperature Regulation

The natural **crimp** (waviness) in wool fibres creates millions of tiny air pockets. Air is an excellent insulator, so these pockets trap warmth in cold weather.

But wool also helps in warm weather—as moisture evaporates from wool, it creates a cooling effect.

**Why this matters:** Wool keeps you warm when it's cold and helps regulate temperature when it's warm. This is why Merino wool base layers are popular with hikers and athletes.

### Fire Resistance

Wool is naturally **fire-resistant**. It won't ignite until it reaches **570-600°C** (compare this to cotton, which ignites at just 255°C). Even more importantly, wool requires **25.2% oxygen** to burn, but our atmosphere only contains 21% oxygen—so wool struggles to sustain a flame.

When wool does burn, it tends to smoulder and self-extinguish rather than producing flames. It doesn't melt or drip like synthetic fibres.

**Why this matters:** Wool is used for aircraft seat covers, firefighter uniforms, and children's sleepwear because of its safety properties.

### Elasticity

Wool fibres can stretch up to **30% of their length** and spring back to their original shape. This natural elasticity helps wool garments resist wrinkling and maintain their shape.

### Natural Odour Resistance

The structure of wool fibres resists bacterial growth, meaning wool clothing stays fresher for longer between washes.

---

## Wool Quality and Grading

The value of wool depends primarily on its **micron count**—the diameter of the fibres measured in microns.

| Grade | Micron Range | Typical Use | Relative Value |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Ultrafine | <15.5 | Luxury fashion, next-to-skin | Highest |
| Superfine | 15.6-18.5 | High-end apparel | Very high |
| Fine | 18.6-20.5 | Quality suiting, knitwear | High |
| Medium | 20.6-23.5 | Outerwear, blankets | Medium |
| Strong/Broad | >23.5 | Carpets, industrial | Lower |

**Why finer is more valuable:** Finer fibres feel softer against the skin, drape better, and can be woven into lighter, more luxurious fabrics.

---

## The Woolmark System

You may have seen the **Woolmark** logo on clothing labels—a stylised ball of yarn that's one of the world's most recognised textile symbols.

Created in **1964**, the Woolmark is a certification system owned by **The Woolmark Company** (part of Australian Wool Innovation). Products must pass strict testing to carry the logo:

| Logo | Requirements |
|------|--------------|
| **Woolmark** | 100% pure new wool |
| **Woolmark Blend** | 50-99.9% new wool |
| **Wool Blend** | 30-49.9% new wool |

Products are tested for fibre content, colourfastness (colour doesn't fade), physical strength, and wash performance.

# Chapter 3: Other Animal Fibres

While wool dominates animal fibre production, several other animals provide valuable fibres with unique properties.

---

## Silk: Nature's Only Filament Fibre

Silk is one of the most luxurious and fascinating fibres in the world. It's the only natural fibre that comes as a continuous filament rather than short staple lengths.

### The Silkworm Lifecycle

Silk comes from the cocoon of the **Bombyx mori**—the domesticated silkworm (actually a caterpillar, not a worm!). The production of silk is called **sericulture**, and it follows a precise lifecycle:

**Stage 1: Egg (10-14 days)**
Female silk moths lay 300-500 tiny eggs, each about the size of a pinhead. The eggs are kept at controlled temperatures until they hatch.

**Stage 2: Larva/Caterpillar (23-28 days)**
The newly hatched silkworm is tiny—about 3mm long. Over the next month, it does nothing but eat mulberry leaves. And eat. And eat some more.

During this stage, the silkworm grows to **10,000 times its original size**—imagine if a human baby grew that much! It moults (sheds its skin) four times as it outgrows each skin.

**Stage 3: Cocoon Spinning (2-3 days)**
When fully grown (about 7.5cm long), the silkworm stops eating and begins spinning its cocoon. Moving its head in a figure-8 pattern, it produces a continuous silk filament from glands near its mouth.

A single silkworm produces **600-900 metres** of continuous silk thread in just 2-3 days!

**Stage 4: Pupa (2-3 weeks)**
Inside the cocoon, the silkworm transforms into a moth through metamorphosis.

### Harvesting Silk

Here's where silk production becomes controversial: to harvest the silk as one continuous filament, the cocoons must be collected **before the moth emerges**. If the moth breaks through the cocoon, it breaks the continuous filament into many short pieces, making the silk much less valuable.

Traditional silk production involves killing the pupa inside by:
- Heating the cocoons (sun-drying or steam)
- This also softens the **sericin** (silk gum) holding the filament together

The silk is then **reeled**—the filament from several cocoons (usually 4-8) is combined and wound together to create a usable thread.

**Scale of production:** It takes approximately **3,000 cocoons** to produce just 1 kg of silk, and **104 kg of mulberry leaves** to feed those silkworms!

### Silk Properties

Silk is prized for its:
- **Lustrous appearance**—it reflects light beautifully
- **Incredible strength**—stronger than steel of the same diameter
- **Excellent drape**—flows and hangs elegantly
- **Temperature regulation**—cool in summer, warm in winter
- **Hypoallergenic** qualities—good for sensitive skin

### Peace Silk (Ahimsa Silk)

Some producers now make **peace silk** or **Ahimsa silk**, which allows the moth to emerge naturally before harvesting the cocoon. This produces shorter fibres that must be spun like other staple fibres, resulting in a slightly different texture.

---

## Luxury Animal Fibres

### Cashmere

**Source:** The soft undercoat of cashmere goats, primarily from Mongolia, China, and Iran.

**What makes it special:** To be classified as cashmere, fibres must be **less than 19 microns** in diameter—even finer than most Merino wool. This extreme fineness gives cashmere its legendary softness.

**Production challenges:** Each goat produces only **150-200 grams** of cashmere per year (compared to 4-5 kg of wool per sheep). This scarcity, combined with the hand-combing required to collect it, makes cashmere expensive.

### Mohair

**Source:** The Angora goat (not to be confused with Angora fibre, which comes from rabbits!).

**What makes it special:** Mohair has exceptional lustre (shine), durability, and takes dye brilliantly. It's often blended with wool to add sheen and strength.

**Production:** Each Angora goat produces **3.6-7.3 kg** of mohair per year.

### Alpaca

**Source:** Alpacas, members of the camelid family native to South America. Australia now has a growing alpaca industry.

**What makes it special:** Alpaca fibre is **3-7 times warmer than sheep's wool** because the fibres are partially hollow, trapping more air. It also contains no lanolin, making it naturally hypoallergenic.

**Production:** Each alpaca produces **3-7 kg** of fibre per year.

### Angora

**Source:** Angora rabbits (remember: Angora rabbits give angora; Angora goats give mohair!).

**What makes it special:** Angora is **6 times warmer than wool** due to its hollow fibre structure. It's incredibly soft and lightweight.

**Production challenges:** Each rabbit produces only about **400 grams** per year, and the fibre must be carefully harvested by combing or shearing.

---

## Common Confusion Alert!

Students often confuse these terms:

| Term | Source Animal | Key Fact |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Angora** | Angora RABBIT | 6× warmer than wool |
| **Mohair** | Angora GOAT | High lustre, durable |

Remember: The fibre name and animal name don't always match!

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. Why is silk called a "filament fibre" while wool is a "staple fibre"?
2. How long is the silk filament from a single cocoon?
3. Why must silk cocoons be harvested before the moth emerges?
4. What is the maximum micron count for a fibre to be called cashmere?
5. Which animal does angora fibre come from? Which animal does mohair come from?

---

# Chapter 4: Plant Fibres

Plant fibres have been used for textiles for thousands of years. Cotton is by far the most important, but linen, hemp, and other fibres each have their own story and unique properties.

---

## Cotton: The World's Most Popular Natural Fibre

Cotton is everywhere. Look at the labels in your clothes—chances are most of them contain at least some cotton. Globally, cotton accounts for about **25% of all fibre production**.

### Australia's Cotton Industry

Australia is a significant cotton producer, with a unique story:

- **91% of Australian cotton** is grown in the Murray-Darling Basin (NSW and Queensland)
- Australia produces **4.4-5.5 million bales** annually (depending on water availability)
- Our yields are approximately **3 times the world average** due to advanced farming practices
- **Over 99%** of Australian cotton is exported, mainly to Southeast Asian textile mills

### How Cotton Grows

Cotton comes from plants in the genus *Gossypium*. The cotton "fibre" is actually the protective fluff surrounding the seeds inside the cotton boll (seed pod).

**The growing cycle (150-180 days):**

1. **Planting** (September-November in Australia)
   - Seeds need soil temperature of at least 15°C to germinate
   - Each seed produces a single plant

2. **Vegetative growth** (first 5-6 weeks)
   - Plants develop stems and leaves
   - Roots grow deep to access water

3. **Square formation** (~5 weeks after planting)
   - "Squares" are the flower buds
   - Plants begin reproductive phase

4. **Flowering** (~8 weeks after planting)
   - Flowers open white/cream coloured
   - After pollination, they turn pink then red
   - Each flower produces one boll

5. **Boll development** (50-55 days after flowering)
   - Inside each boll, 32-40 seeds develop
   - Each seed grows thousands of fibres
   - Fibres are almost pure cellulose (plant material)

6. **Boll opening** (maturity)
   - Bolls dry and split open, revealing white cotton
   - A healthy plant may have 100-120 bolls
   - Each boll contains about 500,000 individual fibres!

7. **Harvest** (March-May in Australia)
   - Defoliants remove leaves to ease picking
   - Mechanical harvesters collect the cotton
   - "Seed cotton" includes fibres, seeds, and trash

### Processing: From Field to Fibre

**Ginning** is the critical first step—separating the cotton fibres from the seeds.

When seed cotton enters the gin:
- **35-42%** becomes lint (the usable fibre)
- **48-55%** is cottonseed (used for oil and animal feed)
- **3-10%** is trash and waste

The lint is then compressed into bales weighing about 227 kg each.

**Subsequent processing** follows similar steps to wool:
1. **Opening and cleaning**—loosening compressed bales, removing remaining debris
2. **Carding**—aligning fibres into a sliver
3. **Combing** (optional)—for finer cotton, removes short fibres
4. **Drawing**—combines and stretches slivers for uniformity
5. **Spinning**—twists fibres into yarn
6. **Weaving or knitting**—creates fabric

### Cotton's Unique Properties

Cotton has some properties that make it ideal for everyday clothing:

**Absorbency:** Cotton can absorb **24-27 times its own weight** in water. This makes it comfortable to wear because it absorbs sweat from your skin.

**Strength when wet:** Here's something surprising—unlike most fibres, cotton actually gets **STRONGER when wet**, increasing in strength by **20-25%**. This is why cotton can withstand repeated washing without falling apart.

**Why does cotton get stronger wet?** Water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the cellulose in cotton fibres, actually helping hold them together more tightly!

**Breathability:** Cotton's structure allows air to circulate, keeping you cool.

**Biodegradability:** As a natural cellulose fibre, cotton breaks down relatively quickly—**1 week to 5 months** depending on conditions.

**Drawbacks:** Cotton wrinkles easily, dries slowly, and can shrink when washed.

---

## Linen: Ancient Luxury

Linen is made from the fibres of the **flax plant** (*Linum usitatissimum*). It's one of the oldest textile fibres—evidence of linen fabric dates back over 30,000 years!

### Why Australia Doesn't Grow Flax

Australia has no significant linen production because flax needs:
- Cool, moist climates
- Specific soil conditions
- Labour-intensive harvesting

Most linen comes from Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe.

### The Retting Process

The key step in linen production is **retting**—using controlled bacterial decomposition to break down the pectin (plant glue) that binds fibres to the woody stem.

**Dew retting:** Flax stalks are spread in fields for about 3 weeks. Morning dew and bacteria gradually break down the pectin. This produces silver/grey coloured fibres.

**Water retting:** Stalks are submerged in water for 10-30 days. Faster and more controlled, but requires careful monitoring—over-retting damages the fibres; under-retting makes them impossible to separate.

After retting:
- **Scutching** beats the stalks to remove woody pieces
- **Hackling** combs out the fibres and separates long "line" fibres from short "tow" fibres

### Linen Properties

Linen is valued for:

**Exceptional strength:** Linen is **2-3 times stronger than cotton** and one of the strongest natural fibres available.

**Durability:** Linen products can last **up to 30 years** with proper care—the fibres actually get softer and more comfortable with age and washing.

**Cool comfort:** Linen conducts heat very well, carrying warmth away from your body. This is why linen clothing feels so cool in summer.

**Quick drying:** Linen absorbs moisture well but releases it quickly.

**Sustainability:** Linen is highly biodegradable—it can break down in just a **few weeks** when buried in soil.

**Drawbacks:** Linen wrinkles easily (those wrinkles are considered part of its character!), is more expensive than cotton, and has limited elasticity.

---

## Hemp: The Sustainable Superstar

Hemp (*Cannabis sativa*) is gaining attention as one of the most sustainable fibre options available. Don't worry—industrial hemp is not the same as marijuana, even though they're related plants.

### Hemp in Australia

Hemp farming has a complicated history in Australia due to its relationship with cannabis. However, industrial hemp (which contains less than **0.35-1% THC** depending on state regulations) was legalised for food in **November 2017**, and fibre production is regulated by each state.

About **9,000 hectares** were cultivated in Australia in 2019-2020, with growing interest from farmers and textile companies.

### Why Hemp Is Considered Sustainable

Hemp has remarkable environmental credentials:

**Fast growth:** Hemp reaches maturity in just **90-120 days** (compare to cotton's 150-180 days).

**Low water needs:** Hemp requires about **50% less water** than cotton.

**No pesticides needed:** Hemp naturally resists most pests and diseases.

**High yield:** Hemp produces **2 times more fibre per hectare** than cotton.

**Soil improvement:** Hemp's deep roots prevent erosion and can even help remove toxins from contaminated soil (a process called phytoremediation).

**Carbon capture:** Hemp absorbs large amounts of CO₂ as it grows.

### Hemp Fibre Properties

Hemp produces some of the strongest natural fibres available:

- **3-4 times stronger than cotton**
- Excellent durability and abrasion resistance
- Gets softer with washing
- Naturally resistant to mould and UV light
- Highly breathable
- Biodegradable

**Drawbacks:** Hemp processing is labour-intensive, the fabric can feel rough initially, and limited processing infrastructure currently exists in Australia.

## The Bamboo Misconception

You've probably seen "bamboo" clothing advertised as natural and eco-friendly. Here's something important you need to know:

**Most "bamboo fabric" is actually rayon/viscose made FROM bamboo—not actual bamboo fibre.**

### What's Really Happening

True bamboo linen—made by mechanically processing bamboo stalks—does exist but is:
- Rare
- Rough in texture
- Expensive to produce

The soft "bamboo" clothing commonly sold in stores is made by:
1. Dissolving bamboo pulp in harsh chemicals (sodium hydroxide, carbon disulfide)
2. Extruding the solution through spinnerets to create fibres
3. The result is rayon/viscose—a semi-synthetic fibre

**The problem:** After this chemical processing, **no trace of the original bamboo properties remains**. The resulting fibre is chemically identical to rayon made from any other plant source.

The US Federal Trade Commission requires such products to be labelled as "rayon made from bamboo" rather than simply "bamboo."

**Why this matters:** Some companies market bamboo rayon as "eco-friendly" because bamboo grows quickly without pesticides. However, the chemical processing involved can be highly polluting, potentially cancelling out those environmental benefits.

# Chapter 5: Synthetic Fibres

Synthetic fibres are entirely human-made, typically from petroleum (crude oil) products. They've revolutionised the textile industry since their invention in the 20th century, offering properties that natural fibres can't match.

---

## How Synthetic Fibres Are Made

All synthetic fibres are created through a similar basic process:

1. **Polymerisation:** Chemicals derived from petroleum are reacted together to form long-chain molecules called polymers.

2. **Melting or dissolving:** The polymer is melted or dissolved into a thick, syrup-like liquid.

3. **Extrusion:** The liquid is forced through a **spinneret**—a metal plate with tiny holes (like a showerhead, but with holes just 0.05-0.1mm in diameter).

4. **Solidification:** The fibres solidify as they emerge from the spinneret (by cooling, evaporation, or chemical reaction).

5. **Drawing:** The fibres are stretched to align the polymer molecules, increasing strength.

6. **Texturising (optional):** Fibres can be crimped, curled, or otherwise modified to change their properties.

The shape of the spinneret holes determines the fibre's cross-section:
- Round holes → standard fibres
- Triangular holes → fibres with enhanced lustre
- Hollow centres → fibres with better insulation

Because synthetic fibres are manufactured, their properties can be precisely controlled by adjusting the chemicals used, hole shapes, and processing conditions.

---

## Polyester: The Dominant Fibre

Polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, or PET) is the most widely used fibre in the world, accounting for about **57% of global fibre production**.

### How Polyester Is Made

Polyester production uses **melt spinning** at high temperatures (**260-270°C**):

1. Chemicals react at 150-210°C to form polyester polymer
2. Molten polyester is extruded, cooled, and cut into small chips
3. Chips are remelted to a syrup-like consistency
4. The liquid is forced through spinneret holes
5. Emerging fibres are cooled by air
6. Fibres are stretched **up to 5 times** their original length to align molecules

### Polyester Properties

**Advantages:**
- Very low moisture absorption (**0.4-1%**)—dries quickly
- Wrinkle resistant—holds its shape well
- Strong and durable
- Resistant to stretching and shrinking
- Easy to care for (machine washable, quick drying)
- Takes colour well
- Inexpensive to produce

**Disadvantages:**
- Not breathable—can feel hot and clammy
- Can hold body odours
- Static electricity buildup
- Derived from non-renewable petroleum
- **Non-biodegradable: takes 20-200 years to decompose**
- Releases microplastic fibres when washed

### Recycled Polyester (rPET)

Polyester can be made from recycled plastic bottles (PET bottles). This **recycled polyester (rPET)** offers significant environmental benefits:
- Reduces plastic waste going to landfill
- Uses **59-79% less energy** than virgin polyester
- Produces fewer carbon emissions

**However, there's a catch:** Research shows that recycled polyester may actually release **more microplastic fibres** during washing than virgin polyester, because the recycled fibres are often shorter and weaker.

---

## Nylon: The First Synthetic Fibre

Nylon holds a special place in textile history as the **first fully synthetic fibre**. It was invented on **February 28, 1935** by Wallace Carothers at DuPont in the USA.

When nylon stockings went on sale in 1940, they caused a sensation—stores sold out within hours, and "nylon riots" occurred as women fought to buy them!

### Nylon Properties

- **Extremely strong:** Stronger than steel of the same diameter
- **Excellent elasticity:** Stretches and recovers well
- **Abrasion resistant:** Stands up to friction and wear
- **Lightweight:** Despite its strength
- **Quick drying:** Low moisture absorption
- **Smooth:** Soft feel against skin

**Disadvantages:**
- Can feel hot in warm weather
- Sensitive to UV light (degrades in sunlight)
- Static buildup
- Made from petroleum
- Takes **30-40 years** to decompose

### Common Uses

Nylon's strength and elasticity make it ideal for:
- Hosiery (stockings, tights)
- Activewear and swimwear
- Parachutes
- Ropes and fishing nets
- Toothbrush bristles
- Carpet fibres

---

## Acrylic: The Wool Substitute

Acrylic was developed as a cheaper alternative to wool. By definition, acrylic fibres contain at least **85% acrylonitrile** (a petroleum-derived chemical).

### Acrylic Properties

**Advantages:**
- Wool-like warmth and softness
- Lightweight
- Resistant to moths (unlike wool)
- Holds colour well
- Relatively inexpensive
- Machine washable

**Disadvantages:**
- Pills easily (forms little balls on the surface)
- Not as warm as real wool
- Static buildup
- Not breathable
- Non-biodegradable (takes **~200 years** to decompose)
- **Releases the most microplastic fibres of any synthetic**

### The Microplastic Problem

Acrylic has a significant environmental issue: it releases approximately **730,000 microplastic fibres per wash**—about **5 times more** than polyester-cotton blends.

These tiny plastic particles are too small for washing machine filters to catch, so they flow into waterways and eventually the ocean.

---

## The Semi-Synthetic Category: Rayon and Lyocell

Some fibres don't fit neatly into "natural" or "synthetic" categories. **Rayon** (also called viscose) and **lyocell** are made from natural materials (wood pulp) but through chemical processing. They're called **semi-synthetic** or **regenerated cellulose** fibres.

### Traditional Viscose/Rayon

Viscose was developed in the late 1800s as a cheaper alternative to silk. The process:

1. Wood pulp (usually from eucalyptus, beech, or pine) is treated with **17.5% sodium hydroxide** (caustic soda)
2. The mixture is reacted with **carbon disulfide** (a toxic chemical)
3. The resulting "viscose" solution is extruded through spinnerets into a **sulfuric acid bath**
4. The cellulose regenerates as solid fibres

**The problem:** This process uses toxic chemicals and produces significant pollution. Carbon disulfide is hazardous to workers and the environment.

### Lyocell (TENCEL™): The Cleaner Alternative

Lyocell (branded as TENCEL™ by Lenzing) uses a much more sustainable **closed-loop process**:

1. Wood pulp is dissolved in a non-toxic solvent called NMMO
2. The solution is extruded through spinnerets
3. **99.8% of the solvent is recovered and recycled**
4. Much less water and energy are used

Lyocell fibres are:
- Strong (stronger than cotton when wet)
- Breathable
- Soft and smooth
- Biodegradable (**55 days** in soil)
- More sustainable than viscose

---

## Comparing Synthetic Fibres

| Fibre | Made From | Key Property | Decomposition Time |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Polyester | Petroleum | Quick-drying, wrinkle-resistant | 20-200 years |
| Nylon | Petroleum | Extremely strong, elastic | 30-40 years |
| Acrylic | Petroleum | Wool-like warmth | ~200 years |
| Rayon/Viscose | Wood pulp | Silk-like drape | Months-years |
| Lyocell | Wood pulp | Strong, sustainable | ~55 days |

# Chapter 6: Managed Environments for Fibre Production

The Victorian Curriculum asks you to understand how fibres are produced in **managed environments**. But what exactly does this mean?

---

## What Is a Managed Environment?

A **managed environment** is a production system where humans control key factors to optimise outcomes. In fibre production, this includes:

- **Selecting breeds/varieties** suited to local conditions
- **Controlling inputs** (water, nutrients, pest management)
- **Managing timing** (planting, harvesting)
- **Using technology** to monitor and improve production
- **Applying quality standards** throughout the process

Managed environments exist on a spectrum—from extensive sheep stations where management is relatively light-touch, to intensive cotton farms with precise irrigation control, to factory settings for synthetic fibre production.

---

## Managed Environments: Wool Production

Australian sheep stations represent managed grazing environments. Key management practices include:

### Breed Selection

Farmers choose sheep breeds suited to their specific conditions:
- Fine-wool Merinos for higher-rainfall areas
- Stronger-wool breeds for harsh pastoral zones
- Crossbreeds for dual-purpose (wool and meat) production

### Pasture Management

- **Rotational grazing:** Moving sheep between paddocks to allow pastures to recover
- **Stocking rates:** Adjusting sheep numbers based on available feed
- **Supplementary feeding:** Providing additional nutrition during drought or when pastures are poor

### Water Management

- Installing bores (wells) and dams
- Creating watering points throughout properties
- Managing water distribution during dry periods

### Health Management

- Vaccination programs
- Parasite control (drenching)
- Shearing timing for animal welfare
- Managing flystrike (a significant welfare and economic issue)

### Technology Integration

Modern wool production increasingly uses:
- GPS tracking of livestock
- Drones for monitoring pastures and animals
- Weather stations for decision-making
- Digital platforms like WoolClip for recording fleece specifications

---

## Managed Environments: Cotton Production

Cotton farming involves more intensive management than wool production:

### Climate Requirements

Cotton needs:
- Long, hot growing season (150+ frost-free days)
- Minimum soil temperature of 15°C for germination
- Adequate water during key growth stages
- Dry conditions for harvest

In Australia, this limits cotton production primarily to northern NSW and Queensland.

### Water Management

Water is the critical management factor for Australian cotton. Methods include:

**Furrow irrigation:** Water flows down channels between crop rows
**Centre-pivot irrigation:** Rotating sprinkler systems
**Drip irrigation:** Water delivered directly to plant roots (most efficient)

Cotton farms typically use **6-8 megalitres per hectare** per season. The industry has improved water-use efficiency by about **40% since 1992** through better management and technology.

### Pest Management

Cotton plants are vulnerable to many pests. Australian cotton farmers use **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:

- **Monitoring:** Regular scouting and trapping to track pest populations
- **Biological control:** Encouraging beneficial insects that eat pests
- **Genetic resistance:** Planting varieties with built-in pest resistance
- **Targeted spraying:** Using pesticides only when necessary and in specific areas

### Harvest Timing

Getting harvest timing right is crucial:
- Too early: Immature fibres reduce quality
- Too late: Weather damage, increased trash
- Defoliation: Chemical removal of leaves 2-3 weeks before picking to ease mechanical harvest

### Quality Assurance: myBMP

Cotton Australia runs the **myBMP (Best Management Practices)** program. Certified farms must meet **over 300 criteria** covering:
- Water management
- Pest management
- Soil health
- Employee safety
- Environmental protection

About **30%** of Australian cotton is fully certified under this program.

---

## Managed Environments: Synthetic Fibre Production

Factory production represents the most controlled managed environment:

### Controlled Conditions

Synthetic fibre factories maintain precise control over:
- **Temperature:** Specific temperatures for each production stage
- **Chemical concentrations:** Exact formulations for consistent results
- **Air quality:** Clean room conditions for some processes
- **Humidity:** Affects fibre properties during formation

### Quality Control

Modern synthetic fibre production includes:
- Continuous monitoring of fibre diameter
- Testing of tensile strength
- Colour consistency measurement
- Detection of defects

### Automation

Most synthetic fibre production is highly automated:
- Computer-controlled processes
- Minimal human intervention
- Consistent output quality
- 24/7 operation capability

2. How do wool farmers manage their pastures sustainably?
3. Why is water management so critical for Australian cotton production?
4. What is Integrated Pest Management (IPM)?
5. How does a synthetic fibre factory differ from a sheep station in terms of environmental control?

---

# Chapter 7: Sustainability in Fibre Production

Every fibre—whether natural or synthetic—has environmental impacts. Understanding these impacts helps you make informed choices as a consumer and evaluate claims about "sustainable" textiles.

---

## Water Footprint

Different fibres require vastly different amounts of water to produce:

| Fibre | Water Use (litres per kg) | Context |
|-------|---------------------------|---------|
| Conventional cotton | 8,000-20,000 | One t-shirt ≈ 2,700 litres |
| Organic cotton | 243-2,000 | Up to 91% reduction |
| Hemp | 2,000-3,400 | ~50% less than conventional cotton |
| Linen | ~6,000 | Flax needs less irrigation |
| Wool | 500-800 | Plus processing water |
| Polyester | 60-100 | But uses petroleum instead |

**Important context about cotton:** The often-quoted figure of 10,000-20,000 litres per kg includes **all water** the cotton plant uses—including rainfall. About **73-75%** of cotton's water footprint comes from rain that would fall anyway, not irrigation.

Australian cotton is relatively efficient, producing more fibre per megalitre of irrigation water than most other countries due to advanced farming practices.

---

## Carbon Footprint

All fibre production generates greenhouse gas emissions:

### Natural Fibre Emissions

**Wool:** Surprisingly, wool has a relatively high carbon footprint of **19-25 kg CO₂e per kg** of fibre. About **50%** of this comes from sheep belching methane (yes, really!). Sheep produce approximately **30 litres of methane per day** through their digestive process.

**Cotton:** About **5.34 kg CO₂e per kg**—lower than wool, mainly from farming operations, fertiliser production, and processing.

### Synthetic Fibre Emissions

**Polyester:** About **5.5-9.5 kg CO₂e per kg** from petroleum extraction, chemical processing, and manufacturing.

**Recycled polyester:** **79% lower** emissions than virgin polyester because it uses existing plastic rather than extracting new petroleum.

---

## Pesticide Use

Cotton has historically been called "the world's dirtiest crop" because it uses a disproportionate amount of pesticides:

- Cotton uses approximately **6% of the world's pesticides**
- But cotton only covers about **2.4% of global cropland**
- Pesticides can pollute waterways and harm beneficial insects

**However, the Australian situation is different:**
- Australian cotton uses far fewer pesticides than the global average
- Genetically modified cotton varieties (about 99% of Australian cotton) have built-in pest resistance
- Integrated Pest Management has significantly reduced chemical use
- The myBMP program requires responsible pesticide use

**Organic cotton** uses no synthetic pesticides but may require more water and land to produce the same amount of fibre.

---

## Microplastic Pollution

This is one of the most significant environmental issues facing synthetic textiles.

### What Are Microplastics?

Microplastics are tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size. When you wash synthetic clothing, friction releases microscopic fibres that are too small for washing machine filters or water treatment plants to catch.

### The Scale of the Problem

- Synthetic textiles contribute **35% of ocean microplastics**
- A single wash can release **640,000-1,500,000 microfibres**
- Acrylic releases the most: ~730,000 fibres per wash
- Polyester fleece releases about 7,360 fibres per square metre per litre of water

These microplastics:
- Enter waterways and oceans
- Are consumed by marine life
- Enter the food chain
- Have been found in drinking water, food, and even human blood

### What Can Be Done?

- Use a **Guppyfriend washing bag** or **Cora Ball** to catch microfibres
- Wash synthetic clothing less frequently
- Use shorter, cooler wash cycles
- Choose natural fibres when possible
- Support development of biodegradable synthetics

---

## Biodegradability

How long does it take for different fibres to break down at end of life?

| Fibre | Decomposition Time | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Linen | 2 weeks - few months | Most biodegradable common fibre |
| Cotton | 1 week - 5 months | Depends on conditions |
| Hemp | Similar to linen | Highly biodegradable |
| Wool | 1-5 years | Depends on conditions |
| Silk | Similar to wool | Natural protein fibre |
| Lyocell | ~55 days | Regenerated cellulose |
| Nylon | 30-40 years | Synthetic |
| Polyester | 20-200 years | Non-biodegradable |
| Acrylic | ~200 years | Non-biodegradable |

**Why this matters:** The fashion industry produces about **92 million tonnes** of textile waste globally each year. If those textiles are synthetic, they'll remain in landfill for generations.

---

## The Mulesing Controversy

**Mulesing** is a surgical procedure performed on Merino sheep in Australia to prevent flystrike (blowfly infestation). It involves removing skin from around the tail area to create scar tissue that doesn't attract flies.

### The Issue

- Mulesing has been standard practice in Australia for decades
- It protects sheep from the often-fatal suffering of flystrike
- However, it causes pain and distress to the animals
- Animal welfare groups have campaigned against it
- Some international buyers now refuse mulesed wool

### Current Situation

- About **70%** of Australian Merino sheep are mulesed
- Victoria requires mandatory pain relief during the procedure
- The **National Wool Declaration** allows growers to declare mulesing status
- About **17%** of Australian wool is now sold as "non-mulesed"
- Research continues into alternatives, including breeding for "plain-bodied" sheep that don't require mulesing

---

## Textile Waste and the Circular Economy

### The Problem

The current textile system is mostly **linear**: resources are extracted → products are made → products are used → products are thrown away.

**Sobering statistics:**
- Australians discard approximately **23 kg of textiles per person per year** to landfill
- Australia is the **2nd highest textile consumer per capita** globally
- Global textile-to-textile recycling achieves **less than 1%**—virtually no clothing is being made into new clothing
- The average garment is worn only **7-10 times** before being discarded

### Circular Economy Solutions

A **circular economy** keeps materials in use as long as possible through:

**Design for longevity:** Creating quality items that last
**Design for recyclability:** Using single fibres rather than blends (blends are very difficult to recycle)
**Repair and reuse:** Extending product life through mending
**Resale and donation:** Giving items second (or third, or fourth) lives
**Recycling:** Converting old textiles into new fibres

### Current Initiatives

- **Better Cotton Initiative (BCI):** Trains farmers in sustainable practices; accounts for ~23% of global cotton
- **Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS):** Certifies organic fibre products
- **Responsible Wool Standard:** Ensures animal welfare standards (prohibits mulesing)
- **Textile recycling programs:** Some brands now accept old clothing for recycling

---

## Making Sustainable Choices

As a consumer, you can consider:

1. **Buy less, choose well:** Quality over quantity
2. **Choose natural fibres when possible:** They biodegrade at end of life
3. **Consider fibre blends carefully:** 100% cotton is easier to recycle than cotton-polyester blends
4. **Look for certifications:** GOTS, Better Cotton, Responsible Wool Standard
5. **Care for your clothes:** Proper care extends life
6. **Wash synthetic items carefully:** Less frequent, cooler washes reduce microplastic release
7. **Donate or resell:** Extend the useful life of items
8. **Support circular fashion:** Choose brands committed to sustainability

# Chapter 8: Putting It All Together

## Comparing Fibre Properties

| Property | Cotton | Wool | Polyester | Nylon |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| Source | Plant | Animal | Petroleum | Petroleum |
| Absorbency | High | High | Very low | Low |
| Strength (dry) | Medium | Low-medium | High | Very high |
| Strength (wet) | HIGHER | Lower | Same | Same |
| Warmth | Low | High | Medium | Low |
| Wrinkle resistance | Low | Medium | High | Medium |
| Biodegradable | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Fire resistant | No | Yes | No | No |
| Typical use | T-shirts, jeans | Suits, knitwear | Activewear | Hosiery, swimwear |

---

## Why Fibres Are Blended

Many fabrics contain **blends** of two or more fibres to combine beneficial properties:

**Cotton-polyester (polycotton):** Cotton's comfort and absorbency + polyester's durability and wrinkle resistance

**Wool-nylon:** Wool's warmth and comfort + nylon's strength and abrasion resistance (common in socks)

**Cotton-elastane (spandex):** Cotton's comfort + elastane's stretch (common in jeans)

**Wool-acrylic:** Wool's warmth + acrylic's lower cost and easy care

**The trade-off:** Blended fabrics are much harder to recycle because separating the different fibres is technically difficult and expensive.
