    {"type":"mc","question":"What is the first stage of wool processing?","correct":"Shearing","correctExplanation":"Shearing is the removal of the sheep's fleece using electric handpieces, done once a year, usually in spring.","distractors":[{"answer":"Scouring","explanation":"Scouring (washing) comes after shearing and sorting; shearing is the first step."},{"answer":"Spinning","explanation":"Spinning comes much later in the process; shearing is the initial stage of removing the fleece."},{"answer":"Weaving","explanation":"Weaving is the final stage; shearing is the first step where the fleece is removed."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What does scouring involve in wool processing?","correct":"Washing the raw wool to remove lanolin, dirt, and impurities","correctExplanation":"Scouring washes raw wool at 60-65°C to remove lanolin, suint, and dirt, reducing weight by about 30%.","distractors":[{"answer":"Cutting the wool into short staple lengths","explanation":"Scouring is washing, not cutting; it removes natural oils and dirt from the raw fleece."},{"answer":"Dyeing the wool fibres a specific colour","explanation":"Scouring is washing to remove impurities, not dyeing; colour is added later in processing."},{"answer":"Twisting fibres together to create yarn","explanation":"That describes spinning; scouring is the washing stage that cleans raw wool."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is the purpose of carding in wool processing?","correct":"Aligning and separating the wool fibres","correctExplanation":"Carding uses wire-covered rollers to align and separate wool fibres after they have been washed.","distractors":[{"answer":"Removing the fleece from the sheep","explanation":"That describes shearing; carding aligns fibres after they have been cleaned."},{"answer":"Selling the wool at an auction house","explanation":"That describes the wool auction stage; carding is the fibre alignment process."},{"answer":"Washing the wool to remove lanolin","explanation":"That describes scouring; carding mechanically aligns and separates clean fibres."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How long does it take a skilled shearer to shear one sheep?","correct":"2-3 minutes","correctExplanation":"Professional shearers can remove a sheep's entire fleece in just 2-3 minutes using electric handpieces.","distractors":[{"answer":"20-30 minutes","explanation":"Modern professional shearing is much faster; a skilled shearer completes one sheep in 2-3 minutes."},{"answer":"1-2 hours","explanation":"This greatly overestimates the time; skilled shearers complete one sheep in only 2-3 minutes."},{"answer":"30-45 seconds","explanation":"This underestimates the time; even skilled shearers need 2-3 minutes per sheep."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is the final stage of wool processing that creates fabric?","correct":"Weaving or knitting","correctExplanation":"The final stage transforms yarn into fabric through weaving (interlacing on a loom) or knitting (interlocking loops).","distractors":[{"answer":"Shearing","explanation":"Shearing is the first stage; weaving or knitting is the final stage that creates fabric."},{"answer":"Carding","explanation":"Carding is a middle stage that aligns fibres; weaving or knitting is the final fabric-creating step."},{"answer":"Scouring","explanation":"Scouring is an early cleaning stage; weaving or knitting is the final step creating fabric."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about wool processing stages.","sentence":"After shearing, the fleece goes through skirting and {{blank:1}}, where the wool is sorted by quality.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"classing","correctExplanation":"Skirting and classing involve sorting the fleece by quality grades before it goes to auction.","distractors":[{"answer":"spinning","explanation":"Spinning comes much later; classing is the quality sorting that follows skirting."},{"answer":"weaving","explanation":"Weaving is the final stage; classing is the quality sorting that happens early in processing."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about scouring.","sentence":"Scouring washes raw wool at 60-65°C to remove {{blank:1}}, suint, and dirt.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"lanolin","correctExplanation":"Lanolin is the natural grease in raw wool that must be removed during scouring.","distractors":[{"answer":"cellulose","explanation":"Cellulose is found in plant fibres like cotton; lanolin is the grease removed from wool during scouring."},{"answer":"polyester","explanation":"Polyester is a synthetic material; lanolin is the natural wool grease removed during scouring."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about a shearer's output.","sentence":"A skilled shearer can remove a fleece weighing {{blank:1}} kg in just 2-3 minutes.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"4-5","correctExplanation":"A typical sheep fleece weighs 4-5 kg when removed by shearing.","distractors":[{"answer":"20-25","explanation":"This overestimates fleece weight; a typical fleece weighs 4-5 kg."},{"answer":"0.5-1","explanation":"This underestimates fleece weight; sheep produce 4-5 kg of fleece."}]}}},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Scouring reduces the weight of raw wool by about 30% because it removes lanolin, dirt, and other impurities.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"The combined removal of lanolin, suint, and dirt during scouring typically reduces fleece weight by approximately 30%.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Students might underestimate the impurity content, but raw wool genuinely loses about 30% of its weight during scouring."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Combing is a wool processing step used specifically for making worsted wool yarn.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"Combing removes shorter fibres and further aligns the remaining long fibres to create smooth worsted yarn.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Students might not know the distinction, but combing is genuinely the step that creates worsted (smooth) wool yarn."}]}
  ],
  "toLevel3": [
    {"type":"mc","question":"Explain the difference between carding and combing in wool processing.","correct":"Carding aligns all fibres generally; combing further separates them and removes short fibres for smooth worsted yarn","correctExplanation":"Carding is a general alignment; combing is an additional refinement step that produces the smoother worsted yarn.","distractors":[{"answer":"Carding and combing are the same process with two different names used interchangeably","explanation":"They are distinct processes; carding aligns fibres while combing further refines them for worsted production."},{"answer":"Carding removes dirt while combing adds colour to the cleaned wool fibres before spinning","explanation":"Scouring removes dirt; carding aligns fibres and combing refines them — neither involves colouring."},{"answer":"Combing is done before carding because it requires the fibres to still be dirty and tangled","explanation":"Carding comes first; combing is an additional refinement step done after carding, not before."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why does the amount of twist in spinning affect the final yarn's properties?","correct":"More twist creates stronger, thinner yarn for weaving; less twist creates softer yarn for knitwear","correctExplanation":"Twist controls the balance between strength and softness, determining whether yarn is suited to woven or knitted fabrics.","distractors":[{"answer":"Twist has no effect on yarn properties; all yarn performs identically regardless of twist amount","explanation":"Twist directly affects strength and softness, determining the yarn's suitability for different fabrics."},{"answer":"More twist always produces better yarn because tighter fibres make superior fabric in all cases","explanation":"More twist adds strength but reduces softness; the optimal amount depends on the intended use."},{"answer":"Less twist creates stronger yarn because loose fibres can grip each other more effectively","explanation":"Less twist creates softer but weaker yarn; more twist increases strength by binding fibres tightly."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why is the wool auction stage important in the processing chain?","correct":"It determines the price and buyer, connecting Australian farmers to global manufacturers","correctExplanation":"The auction is where raw wool enters the commercial supply chain, with buyers competing for quality lots.","distractors":[{"answer":"The auction is where wool is physically washed and cleaned before being sent to factories","explanation":"Scouring handles washing; the auction is a commercial sale step where buyers purchase raw wool."},{"answer":"The auction stage can be skipped because farmers sell directly to consumers who make clothing","explanation":"The auction connects farmers to industrial buyers; most wool requires factory processing before consumer use."},{"answer":"Auctions only set the colour of the final fabric and have no effect on wool pricing at all","explanation":"Auctions determine price through competitive bidding; they are essential for the wool supply chain."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What happens to wool weight during scouring and why is this significant?","correct":"Weight reduces by about 30% as lanolin, suint, and dirt are removed, affecting the yield farmers receive","correctExplanation":"The 30% weight loss means farmers' greasy wool weight overstates the usable fibre content.","distractors":[{"answer":"Weight increases by 30% because water is absorbed permanently into the wool during washing","explanation":"Scouring removes impurities, reducing weight; the wool is dried after washing."},{"answer":"Weight stays exactly the same because nothing is added or removed during the scouring process","explanation":"Scouring removes substantial impurities (lanolin, dirt, suint), reducing weight by about 30%."},{"answer":"Weight doubles because scouring adds chemical coatings that protect the wool from future damage","explanation":"Scouring removes substances, not adds them; weight decreases by about 30%."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Explain why weaving and knitting are listed as a single final stage despite being different techniques.","correct":"Both are fabric construction methods that transform yarn into finished fabric, completing the processing chain","correctExplanation":"Whether yarn is woven or knitted, both methods achieve the same purpose: creating fabric from yarn.","distractors":[{"answer":"Weaving and knitting are actually identical techniques with the same method and equipment","explanation":"They use different techniques (interlacing vs looping) but both serve the same purpose of creating fabric."},{"answer":"Only weaving can be used for wool; knitting is reserved for synthetic fibres like polyester","explanation":"Wool can be both woven and knitted; the technique choice depends on the desired fabric type."},{"answer":"Knitting always happens before weaving so they are really two separate stages in the process","explanation":"They are alternative methods for the same stage; a yarn is either woven or knitted, not both sequentially."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How does understanding all eight stages help explain why wool products take time to reach consumers?","correct":"Each stage requires specialised equipment and skills, creating a long production chain from farm to finished fabric","correctExplanation":"Eight distinct processing stages mean wool passes through multiple facilities and specialists before becoming fabric.","distractors":[{"answer":"Wool products actually reach consumers within hours because modern technology automates every stage","explanation":"Despite technology, eight stages involving different facilities and skills create a substantial production timeline."},{"answer":"Only the shearing stage takes time; all other stages happen instantly through chemical processing","explanation":"Each stage requires time: scouring takes hours, retting takes weeks, spinning and weaving require setup and production time."},{"answer":"The eight stages are performed simultaneously on the same sheep so no time delay exists","explanation":"Stages are sequential; wool cannot be scoured until shorn, carded until scoured, etc."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about spinning variations.","sentence":"More twist in spinning creates stronger, thinner yarn suited to {{blank:1}}, while less twist creates softer yarn for knitwear.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"weaving","correctExplanation":"Woven fabrics require stronger yarn that can withstand the tension of the loom, needing more twist.","distractors":[{"answer":"felting","explanation":"Felting does not require spun yarn; weaving needs the stronger, more twisted yarn."},{"answer":"dyeing","explanation":"Dyeing does not require specific twist levels; weaving requires stronger yarn with more twist."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about the processing chain.","sentence":"After wool is sold at {{blank:1}}, it proceeds to scouring, carding, combing, spinning, and finally weaving or knitting.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"auction","correctExplanation":"The wool auction is the commercial step between farm sorting and factory processing.","distractors":[{"answer":"shearing","explanation":"Shearing is the first step; the auction comes after skirting and classing, before scouring."},{"answer":"spinning","explanation":"Spinning comes after auction, scouring, carding, and combing; the auction is the commercial sale step."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about scouring conditions.","sentence":"Wool is scoured at {{blank:1}}°C to effectively remove lanolin and impurities without damaging the fibres.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"60-65","correctExplanation":"Scouring at 60-65°C is warm enough to dissolve lanolin and remove dirt without damaging wool proteins.","distractors":[{"answer":"20-25","explanation":"Room temperature is too low to effectively remove lanolin; scouring uses 60-65°C water."},{"answer":"95-100","explanation":"Near-boiling temperatures could damage wool protein (keratin); scouring uses the gentler 60-65°C."}]}}},
    {"type":"tf","question":"A skilled shearer may shear 150-200 sheep per day during the shearing season.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"At 2-3 minutes per sheep, professional shearers can process 150-200 sheep in a working day.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Students might think this seems too many, but at 2-3 minutes per sheep, 150-200 per day is achievable for skilled professionals."}]}

    {"type":"mc","question":"A wool processor receives raw fleece that is unusually heavy. After scouring, they find they lost 45% of the weight instead of the normal 30%. What does this suggest?","correct":"The fleece contained more lanolin, dirt, and impurities than average, possibly from environmental conditions","correctExplanation":"Higher weight loss during scouring indicates more contaminants in the raw fleece, possibly from muddy or dusty conditions.","distractors":[{"answer":"The scouring process was done incorrectly and damaged 15% of the usable wool fibres","explanation":"Scouring removes impurities; higher loss indicates more contaminants, not necessarily processing errors."},{"answer":"The sheep was a different breed that naturally produces lighter fleece after washing","explanation":"While breeds vary, a 45% loss specifically suggests excess contaminants rather than breed characteristics."},{"answer":"The fleece was actually synthetic and dissolved during the washing process at the factory","explanation":"Synthetic fibres would not be present in a shorn fleece; excess weight loss indicates natural contaminants."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A yarn manufacturer needs to produce yarn for a hand-knitting brand. How would they adjust the spinning stage compared to producing weaving yarn?","correct":"They would use less twist to create softer, loftier yarn that is comfortable for hand-knitted garments","correctExplanation":"Hand-knitting yarn needs to be soft and easy to work with; less twist produces softer yarn ideal for knitwear.","distractors":[{"answer":"They would use identical twist for both because spinning produces the same yarn for all purposes","explanation":"Twist level is deliberately adjusted: more for weaving strength, less for knitting softness."},{"answer":"They would skip the spinning stage entirely because hand-knitting uses raw unspun wool fibres","explanation":"All yarn requires spinning; hand-knitting yarn simply uses less twist for a softer result."},{"answer":"They would add maximum twist to create the softest possible yarn for knitting comfort","explanation":"More twist creates stronger but harder yarn; less twist produces the softer yarn knitters prefer."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A wool farmer is explaining their production to a school group. How would they demonstrate that each processing stage depends on the one before it?","correct":"Show that fleece must be shorn before sorted, sorted before auctioned, cleaned before carded, spun before woven","correctExplanation":"The sequential nature means each stage transforms the material for the next; skipping steps is impossible.","distractors":[{"answer":"Demonstrate that all eight stages happen simultaneously on different parts of the same fleece","explanation":"Stages are sequential, not simultaneous; each must complete before the next can begin."},{"answer":"Show that the stages can be done in any order with the same result regardless of sequence","explanation":"Order matters critically; you cannot card dirty wool or weave uncarded fibres."},{"answer":"Explain that only the first and last stages matter and the middle stages are optional extras","explanation":"Every stage serves an essential purpose; skipping any stage would compromise the final product."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A textile company wants to create the smoothest possible wool fabric. Which processing stages are most critical for achieving this goal?","correct":"Combing (to remove short fibres and align long ones) and spinning with appropriate twist for smoothness","correctExplanation":"Combing creates worsted yarn by selecting long, aligned fibres, and controlled spinning maintains smoothness.","distractors":[{"answer":"Shearing technique is the only factor because smooth fabric depends entirely on how the fleece is cut","explanation":"Shearing affects fleece quality, but fabric smoothness depends more on combing and spinning processes."},{"answer":"Scouring is the only stage that matters because clean wool automatically produces smooth fabric","explanation":"Clean wool is necessary but not sufficient; combing and spinning techniques determine fabric smoothness."},{"answer":"Weaving alone determines smoothness; all previous stages have no effect on the final texture","explanation":"Earlier stages (especially combing and spinning) significantly affect yarn quality that determines fabric smoothness."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare the wool processing chain to cotton processing. Why does wool have more stages?","correct":"Wool contains natural grease (lanolin) and varying qualities requiring cleaning, sorting, and multiple alignment steps","correctExplanation":"Wool's biological origin creates complexity: lanolin must be removed, quality varies within each fleece, and fibres need alignment.","distractors":[{"answer":"Wool and cotton have identical numbers of processing stages with no difference between them","explanation":"Wool requires additional steps like scouring for lanolin and combing for worsted; cotton has fewer stages."},{"answer":"Wool has fewer stages than cotton because animal fibres are simpler to process than plant fibres","explanation":"Wool actually has more stages due to lanolin removal, quality sorting, and multiple fibre alignment steps."},{"answer":"Cotton requires more stages because plant fibres are harder to work with than animal fibres","explanation":"Cotton processing (ginning, carding, spinning, weaving) typically involves fewer specialised stages than wool."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"If a wool processor skipped the carding stage and tried to spin uncarded wool, what problems would they encounter?","correct":"Tangled, misaligned fibres would produce uneven, weak yarn with inconsistent thickness","correctExplanation":"Without carding's fibre alignment, the random tangle of fibres cannot be spun into uniform, strong yarn.","distractors":[{"answer":"No problems would occur because carding is optional and does not affect yarn quality at all","explanation":"Carding is essential; without fibre alignment, spinning produces unusable yarn."},{"answer":"The wool would catch fire during spinning because uncarded fibres generate friction heat","explanation":"Uncarded wool would produce poor yarn quality, not fire; the issue is fibre alignment."},{"answer":"The yarn would be stronger and smoother because carding actually damages the natural fibre","explanation":"Carding improves fibre alignment; without it, yarn would be weaker and more uneven."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A museum displays the evolution of wool processing technology. How has modern technology changed the eight stages compared to historical methods?","correct":"The same eight stages exist but are now mechanised and faster; the fundamental sequence remains unchanged","correctExplanation":"Modern machinery has sped up each stage, but the basic sequence from shearing to fabric construction remains the same.","distractors":[{"answer":"Modern technology has eliminated all eight stages and wool is now processed in a single machine","explanation":"While machinery handles each stage faster, all eight stages are still required in sequence."},{"answer":"Historical wool processing only had two stages while the other six were invented in the last decade","explanation":"All eight stages have existed for centuries; modern technology has mechanised but not replaced them."},{"answer":"Modern technology has reversed the order so weaving now happens before shearing using prediction","explanation":"The physical sequence cannot be reversed; fleece must be removed before it can be processed."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Apply your knowledge to a production planning scenario.","sentence":"A yarn manufacturer wanting softer knitwear yarn would use {{blank:1}} twist during spinning compared to weaving yarn.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"less","correctExplanation":"Less twist produces softer, loftier yarn ideal for knitwear, while more twist creates stronger weaving yarn.","distractors":[{"answer":"more","explanation":"More twist creates stronger but harder yarn; less twist produces the softer yarn needed for knitwear."},{"answer":"no","explanation":"Some twist is necessary for yarn integrity; less twist, not zero, creates softer knitting yarn."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Apply your understanding of sequential processing.","sentence":"Raw wool must be {{blank:1}} to remove lanolin and dirt before it can be carded and aligned for spinning.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"scoured","correctExplanation":"Scouring is the essential washing step that cleans raw wool before mechanical processing can begin.","distractors":[{"answer":"sheared","explanation":"Shearing removes the fleece from the sheep; scouring is the washing step that cleans the raw wool."},{"answer":"woven","explanation":"Weaving is the final stage; scouring (washing) must happen before mechanical fibre processing."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Apply your knowledge to explain a quality issue.","sentence":"If a processor skipped {{blank:1}}, the resulting yarn would be uneven because fibres would not be properly aligned.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"carding","correctExplanation":"Carding aligns and separates fibres; skipping it would result in tangled fibres producing uneven yarn.","distractors":[{"answer":"shearing","explanation":"Without shearing there would be no fleece at all; carding is the alignment step that affects yarn evenness."},{"answer":"auctioning","explanation":"The auction is a commercial step; carding is the physical process whose absence would cause uneven yarn."}]}}}

  "toLevel5": [
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate why the eight-stage wool processing chain has survived largely intact despite centuries of technological advancement.","correct":"Each stage addresses a fundamental physical or chemical requirement that cannot be eliminated, only mechanised","correctExplanation":"Lanolin must be removed, fibres must be aligned, yarn must be twisted — these are inherent requirements of the material.","distractors":[{"answer":"The industry has resisted all change due to tradition and refuses to modernise its methods","explanation":"The industry has modernised extensively; the stages persist because they address physical necessities."},{"answer":"Technology has not advanced enough to change any aspect of wool processing since ancient times","explanation":"Technology has dramatically improved each stage; the stages remain because they address fundamental material needs."},{"answer":"Government regulations require all eight stages to be performed in the exact historical sequence","explanation":"The stages persist due to physical necessity, not regulation; you cannot weave dirty, unaligned fibres."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how the wool processing chain demonstrates the concept of value addition at each stage.","correct":"Each stage transforms the material into something more useful and valuable, from raw fleece to finished fabric","correctExplanation":"Raw fleece has limited value; each processing stage adds value by cleaning, refining, and constructing the final product.","distractors":[{"answer":"Value is only added at the shearing stage because raw fleece is the most valuable product","explanation":"Raw fleece has less value than processed wool; each subsequent stage increases the material's worth."},{"answer":"No value is added at any stage because wool's value is determined solely by sheep breed genetics","explanation":"While breed affects base quality, processing transforms raw material into increasingly valuable products."},{"answer":"Value decreases at each stage because processing damages and weakens the original fibre structure","explanation":"Proper processing enhances the material; cleaned, aligned, spun, and woven wool is far more valuable than raw fleece."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare the skill requirements at different stages of wool processing. Which stages require the most expertise?","correct":"Shearing requires physical skill and speed; classing requires quality assessment expertise; spinning requires technical precision","correctExplanation":"Different stages demand different types of expertise: physical dexterity, quality judgement, and mechanical precision.","distractors":[{"answer":"All stages require identical skills because wool processing is a single undifferentiated activity","explanation":"Each stage requires distinct expertise; shearing is physical, classing is evaluative, spinning is technical."},{"answer":"Only the final weaving stage requires any skill; all earlier stages are completely automated","explanation":"While automation helps, expert shearers, classers, and spinners bring crucial skills to their stages."},{"answer":"No stages require skill because all wool processing is done entirely by untrained machinery","explanation":"While machinery aids processing, expert knowledge is needed for shearing, classing, and quality control."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate how the geographic separation of processing stages (farms in Australia, scouring and spinning often overseas) affects the wool industry.","correct":"It creates long supply chains with transport costs and carbon emissions, but leverages specialist facilities globally","correctExplanation":"Australia exports 99% of its wool, meaning processing happens globally — adding transport but accessing specialised facilities.","distractors":[{"answer":"All eight stages happen on the same Australian farm so geographic separation is not a factor","explanation":"Most Australian wool is exported for processing; geographic separation is a significant industry feature."},{"answer":"Geographic separation eliminates all quality control because no one oversees the complete process","explanation":"Standards and testing maintain quality across the chain; separation allows specialisation at each stage."},{"answer":"Processing in different countries has no environmental impact because transport uses zero resources","explanation":"International transport adds carbon emissions; the trade-off is accessing specialised processing facilities."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse the economic implications of wool's 30% weight loss during scouring for Australian wool farmers.","correct":"Farmers sell greasy wool by weight but buyers know 30% is impurities; pricing must account for clean yield","correctExplanation":"The industry uses 'clean yield' calculations to price wool fairly, accounting for the impurities that will be removed.","distractors":[{"answer":"Weight loss during scouring has no economic impact because farmers are paid after scouring occurs","explanation":"Most Australian wool is sold greasy at auction; clean yield affects pricing negotiations."},{"answer":"Farmers benefit from the 30% loss because lighter wool is more valuable per kilogram than heavy wool","explanation":"The loss represents impurities being removed; farmers' revenue is based on the usable fibre content."},{"answer":"Scouring weight loss is irrelevant because all wool sells for the same price regardless of impurity","explanation":"Clean yield directly affects wool pricing; higher impurity content reduces the per-kilogram value."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate how understanding the complete eight-stage chain helps consumers make informed purchasing decisions about wool products.","correct":"It reveals the labour, resources, and expertise behind wool products, helping justify quality differences and prices","correctExplanation":"Understanding the full production chain helps consumers appreciate quality differences and evaluate fair pricing.","distractors":[{"answer":"Understanding the processing chain provides no useful information to consumers making purchase decisions","explanation":"Processing knowledge helps consumers evaluate quality claims, care requirements, and fair pricing."},{"answer":"Consumers should only consider the final fabric and never think about how it was produced at all","explanation":"Production knowledge informs care decisions, quality evaluation, and ethical purchasing choices."},{"answer":"The processing chain is deliberately hidden from consumers because it would discourage all wool purchases","explanation":"Many brands now promote supply chain transparency; understanding processing builds appreciation for quality."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how the twist applied during spinning creates a fundamental trade-off in wool product design.","correct":"Higher twist increases strength and durability but reduces softness; designers must balance these competing properties","correctExplanation":"The twist level represents a core engineering trade-off: structural integrity versus tactile comfort.","distractors":[{"answer":"There is no trade-off because maximum twist always produces the best yarn for every application","explanation":"Maximum twist creates very strong but hard yarn; softness requires less twist, creating a genuine trade-off."},{"answer":"Twist only affects yarn appearance and has no impact on physical properties like strength or softness","explanation":"Twist directly determines both strength and softness, creating the fundamental design trade-off."},{"answer":"Modern technology has eliminated the twist trade-off by creating yarn that is both maximum strong and soft","explanation":"The physical relationship between twist, strength, and softness remains; technology has not eliminated this trade-off."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare how the eight processing stages of wool reflect the broader concept of 'managed environments' in fibre production.","correct":"Each stage is a controlled environment where specific conditions are managed to transform the material systematically","correctExplanation":"From controlled scouring temperatures to precise spinning parameters, each stage involves managed conditions.","distractors":[{"answer":"Managed environments only apply to the farming stage; processing stages are completely uncontrolled","explanation":"Processing stages are highly controlled environments with specific temperatures, speeds, and parameters."},{"answer":"None of the eight stages involve managed environments because wool processing is entirely random","explanation":"Each stage carefully controls conditions: scouring temperature, carding speed, spinning twist, weaving tension."},{"answer":"Managed environments only exist in synthetic fibre factories, not in natural fibre processing at all","explanation":"Wool processing demonstrates managed environments through controlled conditions at every stage."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the analytical statement about value addition.","sentence":"Each of the eight wool processing stages adds {{blank:1}} to the raw material, transforming fleece worth dollars per kilogram into fabric worth significantly more.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"value","correctExplanation":"Each processing stage increases the material's worth through cleaning, refining, constructing, and creating the final product.","distractors":[{"answer":"weight","explanation":"Processing generally reduces weight (scouring removes 30%); it adds value, not weight."},{"answer":"impurities","explanation":"Processing removes impurities; each stage adds value by refining the material."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the evaluative statement about skill requirements.","sentence":"The eight stages of wool processing require different types of {{blank:1}}, from the physical skill of shearing to the technical precision of spinning.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"expertise","correctExplanation":"Different stages demand different skills: physical dexterity, quality assessment, and technical precision.","distractors":[{"answer":"chemicals","explanation":"While some stages use chemicals (scouring), the common thread across all stages is the need for different expertise."},{"answer":"machinery","explanation":"While machinery is used, the key differentiator across stages is the type of expertise required."}]}}}
