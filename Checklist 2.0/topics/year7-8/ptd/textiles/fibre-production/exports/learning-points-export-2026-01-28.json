      "code": "1.1",
      "what": "Fibres are grouped by origin: natural fibres come from plants or animals, synthetic fibres are made entirely from petroleum chemicals in factories, and semi-synthetic fibres start with natural materials (usually wood pulp) but undergo chemical processing.",
      "why": "This classification helps you understand where materials come from and their likely environmental impacts, from renewable animal and plant sources to petroleum-based manufacturing.",
      "example": "Wool (from sheep) and cotton (from plants) are natural fibres. Polyester and nylon are synthetic fibres made from petroleum. Rayon/viscose and lyocell are semi-synthetic because they start as wood pulp but are chemically processed into fibres.",

      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Staple fibres are short lengths (a few centimetres to about 50cm) that must be twisted together to create yarn. Filament fibres are very long continuous strands that can be used directly or cut into shorter lengths.",
      "why": "This distinction affects how fibres are processed into yarn and the characteristics of the final fabric, including texture, strength, and appearance.",
      "example": "Cotton, wool, and linen are staple fibres that need spinning. Silk is the only natural filament fibre, with a single cocoon producing 600-900 metres of continuous thread. All synthetic fibres (polyester, nylon) are produced as filaments through spinnerets.",

      "why": "Plant fibres are renewable resources that have been used for thousands of years and remain important for everyday textiles due to their comfort, breathability, and biodegradability.",
      "example": "Cotton fibre surrounds seeds inside the cotton boll. Linen comes from the stem of the flax plant. Hemp comes from the stem of the hemp plant. Jute and sisal are other plant fibres used for ropes and sacking.",

      "why": "Understanding properties helps designers choose the right fibre for each purpose—a sportswear designer needs different properties than someone making children's sleepwear or winter coats.",
      "example": "For summer sportswear, you might choose cotton (high absorbency, breathable) or polyester (quick-drying, lightweight). For children's sleepwear, wool is preferred because it has high fire resistance and won't ignite until 570-600°C, compared to cotton at 255°C.",

      "what": "Australia is the world's largest producer of apparel wool, producing about 25% of global supply. The industry involves approximately 68.5 million sheep producing 280 million kg of greasy wool annually, with 82-86% exported to China.",
      "why": "Understanding Australia's role in wool production connects local agriculture to global textile supply chains and demonstrates the economic importance of fibre production.",
      "example": "Australia has been the world's largest wool producer since 1870. The first Merino sheep arrived in 1797. Today, the major wool-producing states are New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia.",

      "what": "Merino sheep produce the finest wool fibres, measuring as thin as 12-20 microns (a micron is one-millionth of a metre). Different Merino strains are suited to different Australian environments based on their fibre fineness.",
      "why": "Finer wool fibres feel softer against the skin, drape better, and can be woven into lighter, more luxurious fabrics, commanding higher prices in the market.",
      "example": "Saxon Merinos produce very fine wool (≤20 microns) suited to high-rainfall areas. Peppin Merinos produce 21-22 micron wool for wheat-sheep zones. South Australian Strongwool Merinos produce 23-26 micron wool for dry pastoral areas. Human hair is about 70 microns thick for comparison.",

      "title": "I can describe the eight stages of wool processing from sheep to fabric",
      "code": "2.3",
      "what": "Wool processing involves: 1) Shearing (removing fleece), 2) Skirting and classing (sorting quality), 3) Wool auction, 4) Scouring (washing), 5) Carding (aligning fibres), 6) Combing (for worsted wool), 7) Spinning (creating yarn), 8) Weaving or knitting (fabric construction).",
      "why": "Understanding the complete production chain shows how raw agricultural products are transformed into finished textiles through multiple managed processes.",
      "example": "A skilled shearer removes a 4-5 kg fleece in 2-3 minutes. Scouring removes lanolin, suint, and dirt at 60-65°C, reducing weight by about 30%. Spinning twists fibres together—more twist creates stronger, thinner yarn for weaving; less twist creates softer yarn for knitwear.",

      "title": "I can explain wool's moisture management and temperature regulation properties",
      "code": "2.4",
      "what": "Wool can absorb 30-35% of its own weight in moisture without feeling wet because it has a water-resistant outer layer and absorbent inner core. The natural crimp in wool fibres creates air pockets that trap warmth while also allowing cooling through moisture evaporation.",
      "why": "These properties explain why wool is popular for activewear and outdoor clothing—it keeps wearers comfortable in both hot and cold conditions.",
      "example": "Merino wool base layers are popular with hikers because the wool absorbs sweat from skin and releases it slowly into the air, preventing that clammy feeling. The same garment provides warmth in cold weather through trapped air in the crimped fibres.",

      "code": "2.5",
      "what": "Wool will not ignite until it reaches 570-600°C (cotton ignites at just 255°C). Wool also requires 25.2% oxygen to burn, but our atmosphere only contains 21% oxygen, so wool struggles to sustain a flame and tends to smoulder and self-extinguish.",
      "why": "Fire resistance is a critical safety property, making wool suitable for applications where fire safety is important, such as aircraft interiors and children's sleepwear.",
      "example": "Aircraft seat covers are often made from wool because of its fire-resistant properties. If wool does catch fire, it smoulders rather than producing flames and doesn't melt or drip like synthetic fibres, reducing burn injuries.",

      "why": "Understanding grading helps you interpret wool product quality and price differences, and explains why some wool products cost significantly more than others.",
      "example": "Ultrafine wool under 15.5 microns commands the highest prices and is used for luxury next-to-skin garments. Medium wool (20.6-23.5 microns) is used for outerwear and blankets. Strong wool over 23.5 microns goes into carpets and industrial applications.",

Cocoons are harvested before moths emerge to preserve the continuous filament.",
      "why": "Silk is the only natural filament fibre and understanding its unique production explains both its luxury status and the ethical concerns some people have about traditional silk production.",
      "example": "It takes approximately 3,000 cocoons to produce 1 kg of silk, and 104 kg of mulberry leaves to feed those silkworms. The silkworm grows to 10,000 times its original size during the larva stage. Peace silk allows moths to emerge naturally but produces shorter fibres.",

      "example": "After retting, scutching beats the stalks to remove woody pieces, then hackling combs out fibres. Linen is 2-3 times stronger than cotton and can last up to 30 years. Australia has no significant linen production because flax needs cool, moist climates.",

      "code": "6.4",
      "what": "Decomposition times vary enormously: linen takes 2 weeks to a few months, cotton 1 week to 5 months, hemp similar to linen, wool 1-5 years, lyocell about 55 days, nylon 30-40 years, polyester 20-200 years, and acrylic approximately 200 years.",
      "why": "End-of-life impacts matter because the fashion industry produces about 92 million tonnes of textile waste globally each year, much of it going to landfill.",
      "example": "A polyester garment discarded today could still exist in landfill when your great-great-grandchildren are born. Natural fibres like linen and cotton can fully decompose within months under the right conditions. Lyocell offers a middle ground with 55-day decomposition.",

      "title": "I can explain the mulesing controversy and describe alternatives",
      "code": "6.5",
      "what": "Mulesing is a surgical procedure removing skin around a Merino sheep's tail to prevent flystrike (blowfly infestation). While it protects sheep from often-fatal suffering, it causes pain and distress. About 70% of Australian Merinos are mulesed; 17% of wool is sold as non-mulesed.",
      "why": "The mulesing debate illustrates the complex trade-offs between animal welfare, sheep health, and economic considerations in fibre production.",
      "example": "Victoria requires mandatory pain relief during mulesing. The National Wool Declaration allows growers to declare mulesing status. Alternatives include breeding for plain-bodied sheep that don't require the procedure. Some international buyers now refuse mulesed wool.",

      "title": "I can describe circular economy approaches to textile sustainability",
      "code": "6.6",
      "what": "A circular economy keeps materials in use through design for longevity, design for recyclability (single fibres rather than blends), repair and reuse, resale and donation, and recycling. Currently, global textile-to-textile recycling achieves less than 1%.",
      "why": "The linear model of extract-make-use-dispose is unsustainable. Understanding circular approaches helps identify more sustainable production and consumption patterns.",
      "example": "Australians discard approximately 23 kg of textiles per person per year to landfill—the 2nd highest per capita globally. Blended fabrics (like cotton-polyester) are very difficult to recycle. Certifications like Better Cotton Initiative, GOTS, and Responsible Wool Standard promote sustainable practices.",

      "code": "6.7",
      "what": "Sustainable consumer actions include: buying less but choosing quality, preferring natural fibres that biodegrade, avoiding difficult-to-recycle blends, looking for certifications (GOTS, BCI, RWS), caring for clothes properly, washing synthetics carefully, donating or reselling, and supporting circular fashion brands.",
      "why": "Individual choices aggregate to significant impact. Understanding options empowers informed decision-making about textile purchases and care.",
      "example": "The average garment is worn only 7-10 times before being discarded. Washing synthetic items less frequently and in cooler water reduces microplastic release. 100% cotton is easier to recycle than a 60/40 cotton-polyester blend. Proper care extends garment life significantly.",
