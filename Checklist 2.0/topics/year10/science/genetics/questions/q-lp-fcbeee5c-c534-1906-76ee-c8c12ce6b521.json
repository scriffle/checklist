      "question": "A geneticist compares two organisms: Organism A reproduces sexually (with meiosis) and Organism B reproduces asexually (by mitosis only). After an environmental change, Organism A's population survives but Organism B's population declines. Analyse why.",
      "correct": "Organism A's population had genetic diversity from meiosis, so some individuals possessed traits suited to the new environment",
      "correctExplanation": "Sexual reproduction via meiosis produces genetically varied offspring. When the environment changed, some individuals in population A had advantageous trait combinations and survived.",
      "distractors": [
        {
          "answer": "Organism A's individuals were physically stronger because meiosis produces more robust cells",
          "explanation": "Meiosis does not produce stronger cells; the advantage is genetic diversity that provides varied phenotypes for natural selection to act upon."
        },
        {
          "answer": "Organism B's population declined because mitosis introduced too many harmful mutations",
          "explanation": "Mitosis has high-fidelity copying and does not inherently introduce more mutations; the decline is due to lack of genetic diversity, not excess mutation."
        },
        {
          "answer": "Organism A survived because sexual reproduction is always faster than asexual reproduction",
          "explanation": "Asexual reproduction is often faster; the advantage of sexual reproduction is genetic diversity, not reproductive speed."

      "correct": "The claim is partially correct; meiosis II itself does not introduce new variation, but the cells entering meiosis II are already genetically unique from meiosis I",
      "correctExplanation": "Meiosis II separates sister chromatids (like mitosis) and does not add new variation. However, the cells produced are still unique because crossing over and independent assortment occurred in meiosis I.",

        {
          "answer": "The claim is completely correct; meiosis II is unnecessary and could be removed without consequence",

        {
          "answer": "The claim is completely incorrect; meiosis II introduces more variation than meiosis I through additional crossing over",
