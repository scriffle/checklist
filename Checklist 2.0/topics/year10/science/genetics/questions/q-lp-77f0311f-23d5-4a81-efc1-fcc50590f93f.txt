TITLE: I can outline benefits of karyotyping
CODE: 2.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
A karyotype is an organised image of an individual's chromosomes, arranged by size and banding patterns. Karyotyping can identify chromosomal abnormalities such as extra chromosomes, missing chromosomes, or structural changes.

WHY (importance):
Karyotyping is used in prenatal diagnosis to detect conditions like Down syndrome (trisomy 21), in diagnosing genetic disorders, and in cancer research. It provides visual evidence of chromosomal changes that affect health.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A karyotype of a person with Down syndrome would show three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. A karyotype can also determine biological sex by showing whether the 23rd pair is XX (female) or XY (male).

SUBTOPIC: Genes and Chromosomes
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores how genetic information is organised within cells, from individual genes to chromosomes, and how this organisation allows cells to store and access genetic instructions efficiently.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the relationship between DNA, genes, and chromosomes explains how genetic information is packaged, inherited, and expressed. This knowledge is essential for understanding heredity and genetic disorders.

TOPIC: Genetics
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: Year 10
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Understanding how genetic information in DNA is organised into genes and chromosomes, passed to offspring through cell division, and inherited according to predictable patterns.

## TEACHER'S CONTENT

Year 10 Science: Semester 1 Biology 2026

genetic inheritance involves the function of DNA, chromosomes, genes and alleles, and the roles of mitosis and meiosis in passing on genetic information to the next generation; the principles of Mendelian inheritance can be used to predict ratios of genotypes and phenotypes in monohybrid crosses involving dominant and recessive traits
VC2S10U04

•	using models and diagrams to represent the relationship between genes, chromosomes and DNA of an organism’s genome
•	explaining how genetic information passed on to offspring from both parents by meiosis and fertilisation increases the variation of a species
•	using the concept of Mendelian inheritance to predict the ratio of offspring genotypes and phenotypes in monohybrid crosses involving dominant and recessive alleles or in genes that are sex-linked
•	using pedigree diagrams to show patterns of inheritance of simple dominant and recessive characteristics through multigenerational families
•	exploring the role of DNA in cancer or genetic disorders such as haemochromatosis, sickle cell anaemia, cystic fibrosis and Klinefelter syndrome

An organism gets two alleles of
each gene – one from its mother
and one from its father.
A stage of cell
division in which the
chromosomes separate
Anaphase is when the
chromosomes separate and are
pulled away from each other to
opposite sides of the cell.
The repeated process of
cell growth and division
During most of the cell cycle,
a cell grows and performs its
function. This ends when the cell
divides by mitosis.
The base that combines with
thymine to form a base pair
Adenine is one of the four letters
that make up the genetic code in
humans and other living things.
Part of a DNA molecule
that comes in four types:
A, C, G and T
Bases join together in pairs to
form the ‘rungs’ of the DNA
molecule.
The splitting of a cell to
form new cells
Cell division allows organisms
to grow, repair damage and
reproduce. There are two types:
mitosis and meiosis.
A small molecule that joins
with others to form proteins
Amino acids are the building
blocks of proteins, which are the
building blocks of cells.
Two bases joined together
Base pairs form in only two
combinations: A-T or G-C. These
are the letters that make up the
genetic code.

Fertilization combines DNA from
the mother and father so the child
gets half of its chromosomes from
each parent.
Any new cell formed by
cell division
Each daughter cell has its own
nucleus and set of DNA.
A feature that appears when
at least one allele is present
Dominant traits include freckles,

2. Collect object cards
3. Determine whether the objects are living or not
4. As a group can you agree on what is means to be alive?

What is life?
5 core principles of life - Paul Nurse

### Slide 4: MRS GREEN
| Movement | All living thigs move |
| Respiration | Obtaining energy from food |
| Sensitivity | Detecting changes in surroundings |
| Growth | All living things grow |
| Reproduction | Producing offspring |
| Equilibrium | Maintaining stable internal environment |
| Excretion | Removal of waste |
| Nutrition | Extracting nutrients |

### Slide 5-6: MRS GREEN Examples (Plant/Animal)
Respiration, Sensitivity, Growth, Movement, Reproduction, Equilibrium, Excretion, Nutrition

### Slide 7: Cell structure

### Slide 8: Learning objectives
1. Identify the location and role of major organelles in a cell
2. Differentiate between plant and animal cells

### Slide 9: CELLS ARE THE SMALLEST UNIT OF LIFE
All living things on earth are made up of cells.
Cells have specialized internal structures called organelles which allows the cell to stay alive and function efficiently.
All cells come from pre-existing cells

### Slide 10: Categorising cells
Thinking back to year 8, what can you remember?

### Slide 11: ANIMAL CELL / PLANT CELL
We can classify cells as either being an animal or a plant cell. These two cells share many similar components, however, some are unique to each. We call these components organelles. They are small units inside the cell that carry out specific functions.

### Slide 12: Inside the cell
Cells perform specific functions for survival:
- Repair damage
- Produce energy
- Excrete waste
- Build proteins

For efficiency cells have specialised structures known as organelles
Suspended in a gel like substances known as the cytoplasm
Organelles work together to perform the function of the cell!

### Slides 13-16: Types of organelles
[Various organelle diagrams]

### Slide 17: Why do we have lots of tiny cells rather than a few big ones?
**Notes:** A cell's main job is to take in nutrients, which it needs to make proteins, grow, and repair itself. To perform their roles, cells need a bigger surface area (more outside space) compared to their volume (inside space) to make it easier for the cell to get nutrients in and waste out quickly.

### Slide 18: Biology: DNA & Genetics
Year 10 Science

### Slide 19: Why do species look and behave so differently?

### Slide 20: Learning objectives
1. Explain how DNA relates to structure and function of organisms
2. Describe the structure of DNA
3. Explain the complementary base pair rule

### Slide 21: DNA: The Chemical code of life
- Genetics is the study of how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next
- To understand this we must first learn about the molecule that contains instructions that control all body functions
- Life on Earth is incredibly diverse, and this diversity is due to the presence of DNA

### Slide 22: Cell organisation
- A genome – is found in every cell nucleus.
- To fit all this information into a cell's tiny nucleus, DNA is condensed and coiled around proteins.
- This pulls the DNA into tightly packed structures called chromosomes.
- DNA provides instructions for the functioning of an organism
  - sequence of instructions for making proteins
  - proteins needed for life processes

### Slide 23: Proteins
Actin and microtubules are two proteins that provide structure to cells

### Slide 24: What is DNA?

### Slide 25: Deoxyribonucleic acid: DNA
- DNA molecule found in the nucleus of cells
- Codes for production of proteins
- Controls instructions for body functions and characteristics
- Composed of two strands shaped like a ladder
- Known as a double helix

### Slide 26: DNA STRUCTURE
DNA has the same structure in all organisms. It is made up of smaller molecules called a nucleotide (monomer). Therefore, DNA can be considered a polymer made up of smaller, repeating sub-units which are the nucleotides.

In DNA, there are 4 different base types:
- THYMINE
- CYTOSINE
- ADENINE
- GUANINE

Each DNA nucleotide is made up of three components:
- A NITROGENOUS BASE
- A PHOSPHATE GROUP
- A DEOXYRIBOSE SUGAR

DNA is unique as it contains different orders of nucleotides. A DNA sequence is represented by the first letter of each base eg: ATTCGATGC

**Notes:** The nitrogenous bases are what makes each individual unique - everyone has a different sequence of nitrogenous bases and the order is what causes different characteristics.

### Slide 27: Complementary Base Pairing
To make the double helix, two strands of DNA are bonded via their nitrogenous bases.
Nitrogenous bases have a complimentary pair.

- Adenine (A) bonds to Thymine (T)
- Cytosine (C) bonds to Guanine (G)

HINT: Think "Apple in the Tree" and "Car in the Garage" to remember the pairing rule

The two strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between the complimentary nitrogenous bases.
These make up the 'rungs' of the ladder, therefore the 'backbone' is made up of alternating deoxyribose sugars and phosphate groups.

**Notes:** The nucleotides are organized to form the double helix structure. This looks like a twisted ladder. The sides (strands) of DNA are formed by alternating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups of the nucleotides, creating a sugar-phosphate backbone.

### Slide 28: NOW YOU TRY - QUICK CHECK

### Slide 55: Understanding genetic mutations
Learning goals
1. Describe a genetic mutation
2. Distinguish between types of mutations: substitution, insertion, deletion
3. Describe chromosomal mutations

### Slide 56: MUTATIONS OF DNA
Mutations are a permanent change in the DNA and it may be in one gene or in a number of genes (i.e. part or all of a chromosome).

### Slide 57: MUTAGENS
Mutagens are physical, chemical or biological agents that change the DNA of an organism and thus cause a mutation.
As many mutations cause cancer, many mutagens are also carcinogens.

EXAMPLES OF MUTAGENS ARE:
- Radiation - gamma, X-ray, UV
- Arsenic, cadmium metals
- Viruses such as HPV (Human Papilloma Virus)
- Cigarette smoke and alcohol (ethanol)
- Certain strains of bacteria (Helicobacter pylori)

### Slide 58: MUTATIONS
Most often, genetic material is stable, occasionally however, a change can occur – this is called a mutation.
Mutations change the instructions that are encoded in genes.
This CAN result in a defective protein.

### Slide 59: TYPES OF MUTATIONS
**Genetic Mutations:** A genetic mutation is a change that occurs in a gene.
**Frameshift Mutations:** A frameshift mutation is when sequences of DNA have been shifted due to substitutions, insertions and deletions
**Chromosomal Mutations:** A chromosomal mutation is a caused by the centromere failing to separate during meiosis.

### Slide 60: GENETIC MUTATIONS
If the change occurs in a gene then it is called a genetic mutation. This mutation can involve substituting one nucleotide for another (as seen below) or deleting or adding a nucleotide.

### Slide 61: GENETIC MUTATIONS - Point Mutation
A point mutation occurs when one base substitutes for another. As the genetic code is read in groups of three (called triplets), this may or may not influence the final protein.
In this example, the sixth base, T, was substituted by R. In DNA it might be a G substituted for A. This small change will be passed on to the RNA but may not affect the order of amino acids in a protein.

### Slide 62: SICKLE CELL
Sickle cell anaemia is a point substitution that affects the final protein. It causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen.
The gene that makes haemoglobin, which carries oxygen around the body, has substituted an adenine for a thymine (T). The code in the DNA now reads CAC instead of CTC (See image to the right).

### Slides 63-64: FRAMESHIFT MUTATIONS
A deletion of the sixth base (T) in the example would result in: [shift]
An addition of an extra R would result in the code becoming: [shift]
These are called frameshift mutations because the triplet reading frame has been shifted along the DNA strand.

### Slide 15: 2.3 Patterns of inheritance - Punnett square
A Punnett square is a specialised grid to show genetic crosses
- Used to predict outcome of cross-breeding organisms with certain traits

## FILE 3: Mitosis_.pptx

### Slide 1: Year 10 biology - Cell reproduction: MITOSIS

### Slide 2: Learning goals
- Identify the importance of cellular replication
- Explain the role of mitosis
- Identify and describe stages of mitosis

### Slide 3: Cellular divison
Have you ever wondered how organisms (like humans) have grown from just one single cell?
Have you ever thought about how your body has grown over time, or how it repairs itself when you are injured?

The answer to this is mitosis!

Mitosis is used for:
- Growth
- Replacement
- Repair
- Asexual reproduction

### Slide 5: Mitosis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ldPgEfAHI

When mitosis is completed, two genetically identical cells are produced. It is a fundamental process during growth and tissue repair.
It is the most common form of cell division in somatic eukaryotic cells (those that will not become sex cells).

### Slide 6: Phases of mitosis
Remember: PMAT!
- Prophase
- Metaphase
- Anaphase
- Telophase

### Slide 7: Phases of mitosis
Identify and draw each of the cell cycle stages in your books!
- Interphase
- Prophase
- Metaphase
- Anaphase
- Telophase

### Slide 8: Interphase
Getting the cell ready to divide!
- Cell grows and prepares for division
- Include series of stages
- Checks for DNA damage
- Checks cell large enough
- Checks cell has enough energy

### Slide 9: Prophase
- The nuclear envelope dissolves (separates chromosomes from rest of cell)
- Chromatin condenses (sister chromatids join, form 'x' shape)
- Mitotic spindle forms

### Slide 10: Metaphase
- Chromosomes align at centre of cell (Equator or metaphase plate)
- Microtubules attach to each centromere of the chromosomes.
- Cell checks that all chromosomes aligned (ensures daughter cells will split evenly, if unaligned division paused till fixed)

### Slide 11: Anaphase
- Centrosomes pull chromosomes pair apart
- Sister chromatids pulled to opposite poles (sides) of cell
- Microtubules elongate (cell becomes longer)

### Slide 12: Telophase
- New membrane forms around nuclei (opposite ends of cell)
- Chromosomes decondense (unwind and relax). Spindle fibers break apart
- Think of this stage as the reverse of prophase
- Cell continues to stretch (Preparing to separate cell in two)

### Slide 13: Cytokinesis
- Division of cytoplasm to form two new cells
- A cleavage furrow forms (separating the two daughter cells, same number of chromosomes as the parent cell)

### Slide 17: Modelling mitosis
Use modelling clay to construct each of the phases of mitosis
Make sure that you can correctly construct each phase
Write a short description of what your model is showing!

## FILE 4: Meiosis.pptx

### Slide 3: Quick check: Mitosis
1. How many daughter cells are produced at the end of mitosis?
   A. 1 | B. 2 | C. 4 | D. 8

2. What is the structure responsible for pulling the sister chromatids apart during anaphase?
   A. Nucleus | B. Spindle fibres | C. Mitochondria | D. Cell Membrane

### Slide 4: Learning intentions
- Define gametes as sex cells, sperm and ova (egg)
- Recognise that genetic information if passed to offspring through gametes
- Understand the role of meiosis in gamete formation

### Slide 5: Why do children look different from their parents?
What is the cause of genetic diversity?

### Slide 6: Meiosis
For sexual reproduction to occur gametes must be produced

Gametes are sex cells:
- Ova (egg) produced in ovaries
- Sperm produced in testes

Gametes contain half the diploid number of chromosomes
Somatic cells have two copies of every chromosome

### Slide 7:
Only one copy of each chromosome
Fertilisation produces zygote (fertilised egg) with one chromosome from each parent
This means that one chromosome from each pair must be present in each gamete produced

Zygotes are a diploid cell
Contain two sets of chromosomes (23 x 2 = 46 in humans)

### Slide 8: Producing gametes through meiosis
Meiosis occurs in two stages:
- Meiosis I
- Meiosis II

Meiosis I occurs when one cell divides into two
Meiosis II follows, involving those two cells to further divide into four

### Slide 10: Meiosis I
KEY TERMS:
- **Homologous chromosome:** pairs of chromosomes which carry the same genes, but not necessarily the same version (allele)
- **Crossing over:** where homologous chromosomes pair up so closely that they physically swap sections
- **Random assortment:** homologous chromosomes line up in random orientation (left, right, etc)

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Interphase | A diploid cell replicates its DNA to form sister chromatid chromosomes. |
| Prophase I | Homologous chromosomes pair up, allowing crossing over. |
| Metaphase I | Homologous chromosomes pair up in random assortment at the cell equator. |
| Anaphase I | The cell begins to divide, separating homologous chromosomes pairs. |
| Telophase I | The cell fully divides, forming two haploid daughter cells with sister chromatid chromosomes. |

### Slide 11: Crossing over?
- Crossing over results in different combinations of DNA
- Crossing over is the source of variation in sexually reproducing organisms
- Produces new combinations of genes

### Slide 12: Providing variation
Creating genetic variation
The random assortment and crossing over events of meiosis I are key to producing unique individuals.

When homologous chromosomes line up during metaphase I, they align randomly. This means each human gamete receives one of over 8 million combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes!

New combinations also form when homologous pairs swap sections with each other. This crossing over creates chromatids with a combination of maternal and paternal alleles, rather than chromatids purely from one parent or the other.

**DID YOU KNOW?** One set of human parents is capable of producing more genetically different zygotes than the number of human beings that have ever existed!

### Slide 14: Meiosis II
The final stage of gamete production is meiosis II. This mostly follows the same process as meiosis I, with a couple of key differences:
1. Each cell starts with only one chromosome from each homologous pair, so it is already haploid (n).
2. Sister chromatids are separated, with matching chromatids pulled to opposite sides.

The end result is four haploid daughter cells with single chromatid chromosomes (n).

### Slide 15: Meiosis I: Prophase
- Chromosomes condense
- Nuclear membrane disappears
- Spindle fibres form and attach to centromere
- Homologous chromosomes move toward each other
- Crossing over occurs

### Slide 16: Meiosis I: Metaphase
- Homologous chromosomes align at equator (centre of cell)
- Random orientation (Allowing for further genetic variation)

### Slide 17: Meiosis I: Anaphase
- Homologous chromosomes separate
- Pulled to opposite poles of cell (ends)
- Sister chromatids remain attached

### Slide 18: Meiosis I: Telophase
- Chromosomes at opposite poles
- Nuclear membrane reforms
- Chromosomes decondense
- Two haploid daughter cells

### Slide 19: Meiosis II
- Two cells formed during Meiosis I contain chromosome from each homologous pair
- Chromosomes still joined by centromere
- Meiosis II is the stage in which centromere splits

### Slide 20: Prophase II
- Chromosomes condense
- Spindle fibre forms (Attaches to centromere)
- Nuclear membrane disappears

### Slide 21: Metaphase II
Chromosomes align at equator of cell (centre)

### Slide 22: Anaphase II
- Sister chromatids separate from centromere
- Sister chromatids move to opposite poles of cell

### Slide 23: Telophase II

## FILE 5: Inheritance.pptx

### Slide 1: DNA & Genetics - Patterns of inheritance

### Slide 2: Learning Objectives
- Draw and label a Punnett square and interpret the phenotypic and genotypic ratios of offspring
- Use Punnett square to determine the likelihood of offspring inheriting characteristics from parents (dominant, recessive and co-dominant)

### Slide 3: Traits and Alleles
Traits are alternative/different forms of a gene.
They are located at the same place on the chromosome called an allele!

### Slide 4: ALLELES
An allele is one of two or more versions of DNA sequence at a given genomic location.
An individual inherits two alleles, one from each parent, for any given genomic location where such variation exists.

### Slide 5: GENOTYPE VS PHENOTYPE
BB, bb and Bb represent the eye's genotypes – the genetic information or code carried by an individual. The blue or brown colour is the phenotype – the observable characteristics of the individual.

**PHENOTYPE:** Outward expression appearance of a particular gene or characteristic.
Eg: blue eyes

**GENOTYPE:** Genetic make-up of the individual or genes for a particular characteristic.
The alleles that the individual has.

### Slide 6: Types of Inheritance
**DOMINANT:** BB or Bb or WW or Ww
**RECESSIVE:** bb or ww
**CO-DOMINANCE:** BW

Complete dominance (Dominant and recessive):
- Two alleles influence the one trait.
- The dominant allele 'overrides' the recessive allele and the dominant trait is expressed (phenotype).
- If two recessive alleles are present, only then will the recessive trait be expressed.

### Slide 7: ALLELES - Homozygous and Heterozygous
When an individual has two of the same alleles, such as the RR and rr combinations, then the individual is said to be **homozygous** for that allele.
Individuals with the Rr combination of alleles are **heterozygous**.

### Slide 8: PUNNETT SQUARES
A Punnett square is one way of showing all the possible types of offspring that could result from a mating between both parents.

In a Punnett square, the possible gametes produced by one parent are shown across the top. The gametes from the other parent are shown down the side.

### Slide 9: PUNNETT SQUARES AND INHERITANCE
An individual that is heterozygous produces gametes of two types.
- Half the gametes carry the allele for the dominant trait. The other half of the gametes carries the allele for the recessive trait.

The Punnett square below shows that both red-flowered and white-flowered plants can be produced in the next (F2) generation. The expected proportion is 3/4 red flowers and 1/4 white flowers, although the exact proportions might differ in reality.

### Slide 10: PREDICTING A CROSS
It is possible to predict the results of a genetic cross if you know:
- the genotype of the parents
- relationship between the alleles of the trait of interest

### Slide 12-13: CO-DOMINANCE AND BLOOD TYPING
Learning Objectives: Define co-dominance and interpret punnett squares of blood typing.

### Slide 14: CO-DOMINANCE
Inheritance does not always involve complete dominance. Sometimes both traits are expressed together and said to be equally expressed. This is known as co-dominance, a form of heterozygous breeding whereby both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype.

Co-dominance can be observed within the chickens in the image below. The colours black and white are both dominant – their alleles are given in capital letters. When you cross a pure black chicken (BB) with a pure white chicken (WW) the offspring will be heterozygous (BW). The heterozygous chicken expressed both colours equally with a phenotype of both black and white feathers!

### Slide 15: BLOOD TYPING
The inheritance of your blood type is a codominance trait that involves multiple alleles.
Red blood cells have proteins on the surface called antigens that determine whether are blood is type A, B, AB or O.

### Slide 16: Blood Type Inheritance
Each individual inherits one copy of the ABO blood type gene from their biological mother and one copy of the ABO blood type gene from their biological father – each person has two copies of the ABO gene.

### Slide 17: Determining Blood type through the use of Punnett squares!

### Slide 18-19: PEDIGREE ANALYSIS
Learning Objective: Explain and draw a family pedigree for complete dominance using the pedigree rules and determine the genotype of an individual from a pedigree

### Slide 20: Pedigree Charts
A pedigree chart is a diagram that shows a family relationship and how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next. Pedigree charts allow the investigation of the frequency and occurrence of a particular gene over many generations – this helps determine whether traits are dominant or recessive!

Pedigrees are a useful way to help determine how a trait may be inherited.

**Dominant traits** cannot 'skip' generations — in order to have a dominant trait, at least one parent of an affected individual must also have it (unless it is a new mutation). The trait can be seen in each generation. Once it vanishes from a family, it does not suddenly reappear.

**Recessive traits** can 'skip' generations; that is, a child can show the trait without either parents having it.

Autosomal traits do not usually show an obvious sex skew.
Sex-linked traits often have a sex skew.

TARGET: Basic recall and recognition.
TEST: Can student retrieve relevant knowledge from memory?
QUESTION TYPES: Define terms, identify components, recall facts, match definitions.
STEMS: "What is...", "Which of the following is...", "The term for... is...", "Identify the..."
AVOID: Application, inference, or synthesis. Test recognition, not deeper understanding.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can outline benefits of karyotyping
CODE: 2.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
A karyotype is an organised image of an individual's chromosomes, arranged by size and banding patterns. Karyotyping can identify chromosomal abnormalities such as extra chromosomes, missing chromosomes, or structural changes.

WHY (importance):
Karyotyping is used in prenatal diagnosis to detect conditions like Down syndrome (trisomy 21), in diagnosing genetic disorders, and in cancer research. It provides visual evidence of chromosomal changes that affect health.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A karyotype of a person with Down syndrome would show three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. A karyotype can also determine biological sex by showing whether the 23rd pair is XX (female) or XY (male).

SUBTOPIC: Genes and Chromosomes
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores how genetic information is organised within cells, from individual genes to chromosomes, and how this organisation allows cells to store and access genetic instructions efficiently.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the relationship between DNA, genes, and chromosomes explains how genetic information is packaged, inherited, and expressed. This knowledge is essential for understanding heredity and genetic disorders.

TOPIC: Genetics
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: Year 10
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Understanding how genetic information in DNA is organised into genes and chromosomes, passed to offspring through cell division, and inherited according to predictable patterns.

A stage of cell
division in which the
chromosomes separate
Anaphase is when the
chromosomes separate and are
pulled away from each other to
opposite sides of the cell.
The repeated process of
cell growth and division
During most of the cell cycle,
a cell grows and performs its
function. This ends when the cell
divides by mitosis.

thymine to form a base pair
Adenine is one of the four letters
that make up the genetic code in
humans and other living things.
Part of a DNA molecule
that comes in four types:
A, C, G and T
Bases join together in pairs to
form the ‘rungs’ of the DNA
molecule.
The splitting of a cell to
form new cells
Cell division allows organisms
to grow, repair damage and
reproduce. There are two types:
mitosis and meiosis.
A small molecule that joins
with others to form proteins
Amino acids are the building
blocks of proteins, which are the
building blocks of cells.
Two bases joined together
Base pairs form in only two
combinations: A-T or G-C. These
are the letters that make up the
genetic code.

A molecule that contains
genetic information
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic
acid, is a very large molecule
that contains instructions for

A structure consisting of
two chains twisted around
each other
The DNA molecule has a double

A dominant allele is represented
by an uppercase letter. Yy or YY
will result in the appearance of
the Y trait.
The joining of an egg
and a sperm to form a
new organism
Fertilization combines DNA from
the mother and father so the child
gets half of its chromosomes from
each parent.
Any new cell formed by
cell division
Each daughter cell has its own
nucleus and set of DNA.
A feature that appears when
at least one allele is present
Dominant traits include freckles,

The inheritance of traits via
sexual reproduction explains
family resemblances.
Members of a family that are
born and live at about the
same time
Traits are passed down from one
generation to the next by the
transfer of DNA from parents
to children.
Two chromosomes that
contain versions of the
same genes
One chromosome in a
homologous pair is inherited
from the mother and the other
from the father.
The stage of the cell cycle
in which a cell grows and
copies its DNA
Interphase covers most of a cell’s
life span, while it is growing and
performing its normal function in
the body.
A pair of alleles that
influence the appearance of
a particular trait
A genotype is represented by two
letters. An organism’s genotype
determines which traits it
acquires – its phenotype.
A genotype in which the two
alleles are the same
A homozygous genotype consists
of either two dominant alleles –
YY – or two recessive alleles – yy.
The base that combines with
cytosine to form a base pair
Guanine is one of the four letters
that make up the genetic code in
humans and other living things.
A type of cell division that
produces sex cells for
reproduction
Meiosis produces egg and sperm
cells. One cell divides into four
sex cells by two cycles of cell
division.

A type of cell division that
produces cells for growth and
repair
Base pairs form in only two
combinations: A-T or G-C. These
are the letters that make up the
genetic code.
Any cell that divides to
form new cells
A parent cell needs to copy its
DNA before dividing so that
it can be passed down to its
daughter cells.
A stage of cell division in
which the chromosomes
condense
Prophase is when the cell prepares
to divide. The chromosomes
condense and the nucleus starts
to break down.
A stage of cell division in
which the chromosomes line
up
Metaphase is when the
chromosomes line up in the
middle of the cell.
A large molecule made up of
amino acids
Proteins form structures and
perform functions in an organism.
DNA contains instructions for
building proteins.
A version of a gene that is
only expressed when two
copies are present
A recessive allele is represented
by a lowercase letter. Only yy will
result in the appearance of the
y trait.
The collection of traits
observable in an organism
A phenotype includes traits such
as tall, purple flowers and yellow
seeds. It is determined by the
organism’s genotype.
A family tree that shows
how a trait is passed down
through generations
In a pedigree, filled symbols show
the presence of a trait and open
symbols show its absence.
A permanent change in
the sequence of bases that
make up a gene
Some mutations are harmless
while others cause disease.
Mutations can be inherited
by offspring.

A stage of cell division in
which two nuclei form
Telophase is when two new
nuclei form, each with its own
set of DNA.
A chromosome that
helps determine an
organism’s gender
Sex chromosomes come in two
types: X or Y. Most females have
two X chromosomes while most
males have an X and a Y.

How do you know if something is living or not?
1. Form a small group – 4 or less
2. Collect object cards
3. Determine whether the objects are living or not
4. As a group can you agree on what is means to be alive?

What is life?
5 core principles of life - Paul Nurse

### Slide 4: MRS GREEN
| Movement | All living thigs move |
| Respiration | Obtaining energy from food |
| Sensitivity | Detecting changes in surroundings |
| Growth | All living things grow |
| Reproduction | Producing offspring |
| Equilibrium | Maintaining stable internal environment |
| Excretion | Removal of waste |
| Nutrition | Extracting nutrients |

### Slide 5-6: MRS GREEN Examples (Plant/Animal)
Respiration, Sensitivity, Growth, Movement, Reproduction, Equilibrium, Excretion, Nutrition

### Slide 7: Cell structure

### Slide 8: Learning objectives
1. Identify the location and role of major organelles in a cell
2. Differentiate between plant and animal cells

### Slide 9: CELLS ARE THE SMALLEST UNIT OF LIFE
All living things on earth are made up of cells.
Cells have specialized internal structures called organelles which allows the cell to stay alive and function efficiently.
All cells come from pre-existing cells

### Slide 10: Categorising cells
Thinking back to year 8, what can you remember?

### Slide 11: ANIMAL CELL / PLANT CELL
We can classify cells as either being an animal or a plant cell. These two cells share many similar components, however, some are unique to each. We call these components organelles. They are small units inside the cell that carry out specific functions.

### Slide 12: Inside the cell
Cells perform specific functions for survival:
- Repair damage
- Produce energy
- Excrete waste
- Build proteins

For efficiency cells have specialised structures known as organelles
Suspended in a gel like substances known as the cytoplasm
Organelles work together to perform the function of the cell!

### Slides 13-16: Types of organelles
[Various organelle diagrams]

### Slide 17: Why do we have lots of tiny cells rather than a few big ones?
**Notes:** A cell's main job is to take in nutrients, which it needs to make proteins, grow, and repair itself. To perform their roles, cells need a bigger surface area (more outside space) compared to their volume (inside space) to make it easier for the cell to get nutrients in and waste out quickly.

### Slide 18: Biology: DNA & Genetics
Year 10 Science

### Slide 19: Why do species look and behave so differently?

### Slide 20: Learning objectives
1. Explain how DNA relates to structure and function of organisms
2. Describe the structure of DNA
3. Explain the complementary base pair rule

### Slide 21: DNA: The Chemical code of life
- Genetics is the study of how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next
- To understand this we must first learn about the molecule that contains instructions that control all body functions
- Life on Earth is incredibly diverse, and this diversity is due to the presence of DNA

### Slide 22: Cell organisation
- A genome – is found in every cell nucleus.
- To fit all this information into a cell's tiny nucleus, DNA is condensed and coiled around proteins.
- This pulls the DNA into tightly packed structures called chromosomes.
- DNA provides instructions for the functioning of an organism
  - sequence of instructions for making proteins
  - proteins needed for life processes

### Slide 23: Proteins
Actin and microtubules are two proteins that provide structure to cells

### Slide 24: What is DNA?

### Slide 25: Deoxyribonucleic acid: DNA
- DNA molecule found in the nucleus of cells
- Codes for production of proteins
- Controls instructions for body functions and characteristics
- Composed of two strands shaped like a ladder
- Known as a double helix

### Slide 26: DNA STRUCTURE
DNA has the same structure in all organisms. It is made up of smaller molecules called a nucleotide (monomer). Therefore, DNA can be considered a polymer made up of smaller, repeating sub-units which are the nucleotides.

In DNA, there are 4 different base types:
- THYMINE
- CYTOSINE
- ADENINE
- GUANINE

Each DNA nucleotide is made up of three components:
- A NITROGENOUS BASE
- A PHOSPHATE GROUP
- A DEOXYRIBOSE SUGAR

DNA is unique as it contains different orders of nucleotides. A DNA sequence is represented by the first letter of each base eg: ATTCGATGC

**Notes:** The nitrogenous bases are what makes each individual unique - everyone has a different sequence of nitrogenous bases and the order is what causes different characteristics.

### Slide 27: Complementary Base Pairing
To make the double helix, two strands of DNA are bonded via their nitrogenous bases.
Nitrogenous bases have a complimentary pair.

- Adenine (A) bonds to Thymine (T)
- Cytosine (C) bonds to Guanine (G)

HINT: Think "Apple in the Tree" and "Car in the Garage" to remember the pairing rule

The two strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between the complimentary nitrogenous bases.
These make up the 'rungs' of the ladder, therefore the 'backbone' is made up of alternating deoxyribose sugars and phosphate groups.

**Notes:** The nucleotides are organized to form the double helix structure. This looks like a twisted ladder. The sides (strands) of DNA are formed by alternating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups of the nucleotides, creating a sugar-phosphate backbone.

### Slide 28: NOW YOU TRY - QUICK CHECK
Have a go at completing the complementary sequence for the below:
A T A T C A T G C G G G

### Slide 55: Understanding genetic mutations
Learning goals
1. Describe a genetic mutation
2. Distinguish between types of mutations: substitution, insertion, deletion
3. Describe chromosomal mutations

### Slide 56: MUTATIONS OF DNA
Mutations are a permanent change in the DNA and it may be in one gene or in a number of genes (i.e. part or all of a chromosome).

### Slide 57: MUTAGENS
Mutagens are physical, chemical or biological agents that change the DNA of an organism and thus cause a mutation.
As many mutations cause cancer, many mutagens are also carcinogens.

EXAMPLES OF MUTAGENS ARE:
- Radiation - gamma, X-ray, UV
- Arsenic, cadmium metals
- Viruses such as HPV (Human Papilloma Virus)
- Cigarette smoke and alcohol (ethanol)
- Certain strains of bacteria (Helicobacter pylori)

### Slide 58: MUTATIONS
Most often, genetic material is stable, occasionally however, a change can occur – this is called a mutation.
Mutations change the instructions that are encoded in genes.
This CAN result in a defective protein.

### Slide 59: TYPES OF MUTATIONS
**Genetic Mutations:** A genetic mutation is a change that occurs in a gene.
**Frameshift Mutations:** A frameshift mutation is when sequences of DNA have been shifted due to substitutions, insertions and deletions
**Chromosomal Mutations:** A chromosomal mutation is a caused by the centromere failing to separate during meiosis.

### Slide 60: GENETIC MUTATIONS
If the change occurs in a gene then it is called a genetic mutation. This mutation can involve substituting one nucleotide for another (as seen below) or deleting or adding a nucleotide.

### Slide 61: GENETIC MUTATIONS - Point Mutation
A point mutation occurs when one base substitutes for another. As the genetic code is read in groups of three (called triplets), this may or may not influence the final protein.
In this example, the sixth base, T, was substituted by R. In DNA it might be a G substituted for A. This small change will be passed on to the RNA but may not affect the order of amino acids in a protein.

### Slide 62: SICKLE CELL
Sickle cell anaemia is a point substitution that affects the final protein. It causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen.
The gene that makes haemoglobin, which carries oxygen around the body, has substituted an adenine for a thymine (T). The code in the DNA now reads CAC instead of CTC (See image to the right).

### Slides 63-64: FRAMESHIFT MUTATIONS
A deletion of the sixth base (T) in the example would result in: [shift]
An addition of an extra R would result in the code becoming: [shift]
These are called frameshift mutations because the triplet reading frame has been shifted along the DNA strand.

**Dominant:** A characteristic in which the allele responsible is always expressed in the phenotype
**Recessive:** A characteristic in which the allele responsible is only expressed in the phenotype if there is no dominant allele present (i.e., homozygous genotypes)

### Slide 15: 2.3 Patterns of inheritance - Punnett square
A Punnett square is a specialised grid to show genetic crosses
- Used to predict outcome of cross-breeding organisms with certain traits
- You need to know the genotype of the parents and then work out what genetic information they could pass on to their offspring via the gametes

F1 genotype: 50% Bb, 50% bb
F1 phenotype: 50% black mice, 50% white mice

### Slide 16: 2.3 Patterns of inheritance - Codominance

## FILE 3: Mitosis_.pptx

### Slide 1: Year 10 biology - Cell reproduction: MITOSIS

### Slide 2: Learning goals
- Identify the importance of cellular replication
- Explain the role of mitosis
- Identify and describe stages of mitosis

### Slide 3: Cellular divison
Have you ever wondered how organisms (like humans) have grown from just one single cell?
Have you ever thought about how your body has grown over time, or how it repairs itself when you are injured?

The answer to this is mitosis!

Mitosis is used for:
- Growth
- Replacement
- Repair
- Asexual reproduction

### Slide 5: Mitosis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ldPgEfAHI

When mitosis is completed, two genetically identical cells are produced. It is a fundamental process during growth and tissue repair.
It is the most common form of cell division in somatic eukaryotic cells (those that will not become sex cells).

### Slide 6: Phases of mitosis
Remember: PMAT!
- Prophase
- Metaphase
- Anaphase
- Telophase

### Slide 7: Phases of mitosis
Identify and draw each of the cell cycle stages in your books!
- Interphase
- Prophase
- Metaphase
- Anaphase
- Telophase

### Slide 8: Interphase
Getting the cell ready to divide!
- Cell grows and prepares for division
- Include series of stages
- Checks for DNA damage
- Checks cell large enough
- Checks cell has enough energy

### Slide 9: Prophase
- The nuclear envelope dissolves (separates chromosomes from rest of cell)
- Chromatin condenses (sister chromatids join, form 'x' shape)
- Mitotic spindle forms

### Slide 10: Metaphase
- Chromosomes align at centre of cell (Equator or metaphase plate)
- Microtubules attach to each centromere of the chromosomes.
- Cell checks that all chromosomes aligned (ensures daughter cells will split evenly, if unaligned division paused till fixed)

### Slide 11: Anaphase
- Centrosomes pull chromosomes pair apart
- Sister chromatids pulled to opposite poles (sides) of cell
- Microtubules elongate (cell becomes longer)

### Slide 12: Telophase
- New membrane forms around nuclei (opposite ends of cell)
- Chromosomes decondense (unwind and relax). Spindle fibers break apart
- Think of this stage as the reverse of prophase
- Cell continues to stretch (Preparing to separate cell in two)

### Slide 13: Cytokinesis
- Division of cytoplasm to form two new cells
- A cleavage furrow forms (separating the two daughter cells, same number of chromosomes as the parent cell)

### Slide 17: Modelling mitosis
Use modelling clay to construct each of the phases of mitosis
Make sure that you can correctly construct each phase
Write a short description of what your model is showing!

## FILE 4: Meiosis.pptx

### Slide 3: Quick check: Mitosis
1. How many daughter cells are produced at the end of mitosis?
   A. 1 | B. 2 | C. 4 | D. 8

2. What is the structure responsible for pulling the sister chromatids apart during anaphase?
   A. Nucleus | B. Spindle fibres | C. Mitochondria | D. Cell Membrane

### Slide 4: Learning intentions
- Define gametes as sex cells, sperm and ova (egg)
- Recognise that genetic information if passed to offspring through gametes
- Understand the role of meiosis in gamete formation

### Slide 5: Why do children look different from their parents?
What is the cause of genetic diversity?

### Slide 6: Meiosis
For sexual reproduction to occur gametes must be produced

Gametes are sex cells:
- Ova (egg) produced in ovaries
- Sperm produced in testes

Gametes contain half the diploid number of chromosomes
Somatic cells have two copies of every chromosome

### Slide 7:
Only one copy of each chromosome
Fertilisation produces zygote (fertilised egg) with one chromosome from each parent
This means that one chromosome from each pair must be present in each gamete produced

Zygotes are a diploid cell
Contain two sets of chromosomes (23 x 2 = 46 in humans)

### Slide 8: Producing gametes through meiosis
Meiosis occurs in two stages:
- Meiosis I
- Meiosis II

Meiosis I occurs when one cell divides into two
Meiosis II follows, involving those two cells to further divide into four

### Slide 10: Meiosis I
KEY TERMS:
- **Homologous chromosome:** pairs of chromosomes which carry the same genes, but not necessarily the same version (allele)
- **Crossing over:** where homologous chromosomes pair up so closely that they physically swap sections
- **Random assortment:** homologous chromosomes line up in random orientation (left, right, etc)

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Interphase | A diploid cell replicates its DNA to form sister chromatid chromosomes. |
| Prophase I | Homologous chromosomes pair up, allowing crossing over. |
| Metaphase I | Homologous chromosomes pair up in random assortment at the cell equator. |
| Anaphase I | The cell begins to divide, separating homologous chromosomes pairs. |
| Telophase I | The cell fully divides, forming two haploid daughter cells with sister chromatid chromosomes. |

### Slide 11: Crossing over?
- Crossing over results in different combinations of DNA
- Crossing over is the source of variation in sexually reproducing organisms
- Produces new combinations of genes

### Slide 12: Providing variation
Creating genetic variation
The random assortment and crossing over events of meiosis I are key to producing unique individuals.

When homologous chromosomes line up during metaphase I, they align randomly. This means each human gamete receives one of over 8 million combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes!

New combinations also form when homologous pairs swap sections with each other. This crossing over creates chromatids with a combination of maternal and paternal alleles, rather than chromatids purely from one parent or the other.

**DID YOU KNOW?** One set of human parents is capable of producing more genetically different zygotes than the number of human beings that have ever existed!

### Slide 14: Meiosis II
The final stage of gamete production is meiosis II. This mostly follows the same process as meiosis I, with a couple of key differences:
1. Each cell starts with only one chromosome from each homologous pair, so it is already haploid (n).
2. Sister chromatids are separated, with matching chromatids pulled to opposite sides.

The end result is four haploid daughter cells with single chromatid chromosomes (n).

### Slide 15: Meiosis I: Prophase
- Chromosomes condense
- Nuclear membrane disappears
- Spindle fibres form and attach to centromere
- Homologous chromosomes move toward each other
- Crossing over occurs

### Slide 16: Meiosis I: Metaphase
- Homologous chromosomes align at equator (centre of cell)
- Random orientation (Allowing for further genetic variation)

### Slide 17: Meiosis I: Anaphase
- Homologous chromosomes separate
- Pulled to opposite poles of cell (ends)
- Sister chromatids remain attached

### Slide 18: Meiosis I: Telophase
- Chromosomes at opposite poles
- Nuclear membrane reforms
- Chromosomes decondense
- Two haploid daughter cells

### Slide 19: Meiosis II
- Two cells formed during Meiosis I contain chromosome from each homologous pair
- Chromosomes still joined by centromere
- Meiosis II is the stage in which centromere splits

### Slide 20: Prophase II
- Chromosomes condense
- Spindle fibre forms (Attaches to centromere)
- Nuclear membrane disappears

### Slide 21: Metaphase II
Chromosomes align at equator of cell (centre)

### Slide 22: Anaphase II
- Sister chromatids separate from centromere
- Sister chromatids move to opposite poles of cell

### Slide 23: Telophase II
- Chromatids reach opposite poles of cell
- Cytokinesis begins
- Following cytokinesis total of 4 daughter cells produced (Genetically unique)

## FILE 5: Inheritance.pptx

### Slide 1: DNA & Genetics - Patterns of inheritance

### Slide 2: Learning Objectives
- Draw and label a Punnett square and interpret the phenotypic and genotypic ratios of offspring
- Use Punnett square to determine the likelihood of offspring inheriting characteristics from parents (dominant, recessive and co-dominant)

### Slide 3: Traits and Alleles
Traits are alternative/different forms of a gene.
They are located at the same place on the chromosome called an allele!

### Slide 4: ALLELES
An allele is one of two or more versions of DNA sequence at a given genomic location.
An individual inherits two alleles, one from each parent, for any given genomic location where such variation exists.

### Slide 5: GENOTYPE VS PHENOTYPE
BB, bb and Bb represent the eye's genotypes – the genetic information or code carried by an individual. The blue or brown colour is the phenotype – the observable characteristics of the individual.

**PHENOTYPE:** Outward expression appearance of a particular gene or characteristic.
Eg: blue eyes

**GENOTYPE:** Genetic make-up of the individual or genes for a particular characteristic.
The alleles that the individual has.

### Slide 6: Types of Inheritance
**DOMINANT:** BB or Bb or WW or Ww
**RECESSIVE:** bb or ww
**CO-DOMINANCE:** BW

Complete dominance (Dominant and recessive):
- Two alleles influence the one trait.
- The dominant allele 'overrides' the recessive allele and the dominant trait is expressed (phenotype).
- If two recessive alleles are present, only then will the recessive trait be expressed.

### Slide 7: ALLELES - Homozygous and Heterozygous
When an individual has two of the same alleles, such as the RR and rr combinations, then the individual is said to be **homozygous** for that allele.
Individuals with the Rr combination of alleles are **heterozygous**.

### Slide 8: PUNNETT SQUARES
A Punnett square is one way of showing all the possible types of offspring that could result from a mating between both parents.

In a Punnett square, the possible gametes produced by one parent are shown across the top. The gametes from the other parent are shown down the side.

### Slide 9: PUNNETT SQUARES AND INHERITANCE
An individual that is heterozygous produces gametes of two types.
- Half the gametes carry the allele for the dominant trait. The other half of the gametes carries the allele for the recessive trait.

The Punnett square below shows that both red-flowered and white-flowered plants can be produced in the next (F2) generation. The expected proportion is 3/4 red flowers and 1/4 white flowers, although the exact proportions might differ in reality.

### Slide 10: PREDICTING A CROSS
It is possible to predict the results of a genetic cross if you know:
- the genotype of the parents
- relationship between the alleles of the trait of interest

### Slide 12-13: CO-DOMINANCE AND BLOOD TYPING
Learning Objectives: Define co-dominance and interpret punnett squares of blood typing.

### Slide 14: CO-DOMINANCE
Inheritance does not always involve complete dominance. Sometimes both traits are expressed together and said to be equally expressed. This is known as co-dominance, a form of heterozygous breeding whereby both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype.

Co-dominance can be observed within the chickens in the image below. The colours black and white are both dominant – their alleles are given in capital letters. When you cross a pure black chicken (BB) with a pure white chicken (WW) the offspring will be heterozygous (BW). The heterozygous chicken expressed both colours equally with a phenotype of both black and white feathers!

### Slide 15: BLOOD TYPING
The inheritance of your blood type is a codominance trait that involves multiple alleles.
Red blood cells have proteins on the surface called antigens that determine whether are blood is type A, B, AB or O.

### Slide 16: Blood Type Inheritance
Each individual inherits one copy of the ABO blood type gene from their biological mother and one copy of the ABO blood type gene from their biological father – each person has two copies of the ABO gene.

### Slide 17: Determining Blood type through the use of Punnett squares!

### Slide 18-19: PEDIGREE ANALYSIS
Learning Objective: Explain and draw a family pedigree for complete dominance using the pedigree rules and determine the genotype of an individual from a pedigree

### Slide 20: Pedigree Charts
A pedigree chart is a diagram that shows a family relationship and how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next. Pedigree charts allow the investigation of the frequency and occurrence of a particular gene over many generations – this helps determine whether traits are dominant or recessive!

Pedigrees are a useful way to help determine how a trait may be inherited.

**Dominant traits** cannot 'skip' generations — in order to have a dominant trait, at least one parent of an affected individual must also have it (unless it is a new mutation). The trait can be seen in each generation. Once it vanishes from a family, it does not suddenly reappear.

**Recessive traits** can 'skip' generations; that is, a child can show the trait without either parents having it.

Autosomal traits do not usually show an obvious sex skew.
Sex-linked traits often have a sex skew.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.

TITLE: I can outline benefits of karyotyping
CODE: 2.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
A karyotype is an organised image of an individual's chromosomes, arranged by size and banding patterns. Karyotyping can identify chromosomal abnormalities such as extra chromosomes, missing chromosomes, or structural changes.

WHY (importance):
Karyotyping is used in prenatal diagnosis to detect conditions like Down syndrome (trisomy 21), in diagnosing genetic disorders, and in cancer research. It provides visual evidence of chromosomal changes that affect health.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A karyotype of a person with Down syndrome would show three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. A karyotype can also determine biological sex by showing whether the 23rd pair is XX (female) or XY (male).

SUBTOPIC: Genes and Chromosomes
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores how genetic information is organised within cells, from individual genes to chromosomes, and how this organisation allows cells to store and access genetic instructions efficiently.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the relationship between DNA, genes, and chromosomes explains how genetic information is packaged, inherited, and expressed. This knowledge is essential for understanding heredity and genetic disorders.

## TEACHER'S CONTENT

Year 10 Science: Semester 1 Biology 2026

genetic inheritance involves the function of DNA, chromosomes, genes and alleles, and the roles of mitosis and meiosis in passing on genetic information to the next generation; the principles of Mendelian inheritance can be used to predict ratios of genotypes and phenotypes in monohybrid crosses involving dominant and recessive traits
VC2S10U04

•	using models and diagrams to represent the relationship between genes, chromosomes and DNA of an organism’s genome
•	explaining how genetic information passed on to offspring from both parents by meiosis and fertilisation increases the variation of a species
•	using the concept of Mendelian inheritance to predict the ratio of offspring genotypes and phenotypes in monohybrid crosses involving dominant and recessive alleles or in genes that are sex-linked
•	using pedigree diagrams to show patterns of inheritance of simple dominant and recessive characteristics through multigenerational families
•	exploring the role of DNA in cancer or genetic disorders such as haemochromatosis, sickle cell anaemia, cystic fibrosis and Klinefelter syndrome

Students learn that:
investigable questions, reasoned predictions and hypotheses can be used in guiding investigations to test and develop explanatory models and relationships

A version of a gene
An organism gets two alleles of
each gene – one from its mother
and one from its father.
A stage of cell
division in which the
chromosomes separate
Anaphase is when the
chromosomes separate and are
pulled away from each other to
opposite sides of the cell.
The repeated process of
cell growth and division
During most of the cell cycle,
a cell grows and performs its
function. This ends when the cell
divides by mitosis.

thymine to form a base pair
Adenine is one of the four letters
that make up the genetic code in
humans and other living things.
Part of a DNA molecule
that comes in four types:
A, C, G and T
Bases join together in pairs to
form the ‘rungs’ of the DNA
molecule.
The splitting of a cell to
form new cells
Cell division allows organisms
to grow, repair damage and
reproduce. There are two types:
mitosis and meiosis.
A small molecule that joins
with others to form proteins
Amino acids are the building
blocks of proteins, which are the
building blocks of cells.
Two bases joined together
Base pairs form in only two
combinations: A-T or G-C. These
are the letters that make up the
genetic code.

genetic information
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic
acid, is a very large molecule

new organism
Fertilization combines DNA from
the mother and father so the child
gets half of its chromosomes from
each parent.
Any new cell formed by
cell division
Each daughter cell has its own
nucleus and set of DNA.
A feature that appears when
at least one allele is present
Dominant traits include freckles,
dimples and the ability to roll

### Slide 5-6: MRS GREEN Examples (Plant/Animal)
Respiration, Sensitivity, Growth, Movement, Reproduction, Equilibrium, Excretion, Nutrition

### Slide 7: Cell structure

### Slide 8: Learning objectives
1. Identify the location and role of major organelles in a cell
2. Differentiate between plant and animal cells

### Slide 9: CELLS ARE THE SMALLEST UNIT OF LIFE
All living things on earth are made up of cells.
Cells have specialized internal structures called organelles which allows the cell to stay alive and function efficiently.
All cells come from pre-existing cells

### Slide 10: Categorising cells
Thinking back to year 8, what can you remember?

### Slide 11: ANIMAL CELL / PLANT CELL
We can classify cells as either being an animal or a plant cell. These two cells share many similar components, however, some are unique to each. We call these components organelles. They are small units inside the cell that carry out specific functions.

### Slide 12: Inside the cell
Cells perform specific functions for survival:
- Repair damage
- Produce energy
- Excrete waste
- Build proteins

For efficiency cells have specialised structures known as organelles
Suspended in a gel like substances known as the cytoplasm
Organelles work together to perform the function of the cell!

### Slides 13-16: Types of organelles
[Various organelle diagrams]

### Slide 17: Why do we have lots of tiny cells rather than a few big ones?
**Notes:** A cell's main job is to take in nutrients, which it needs to make proteins, grow, and repair itself. To perform their roles, cells need a bigger surface area (more outside space) compared to their volume (inside space) to make it easier for the cell to get nutrients in and waste out quickly.

### Slide 18: Biology: DNA & Genetics
Year 10 Science

### Slide 19: Why do species look and behave so differently?

### Slide 20: Learning objectives
1. Explain how DNA relates to structure and function of organisms
2. Describe the structure of DNA
3. Explain the complementary base pair rule

### Slide 21: DNA: The Chemical code of life
- Genetics is the study of how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next
- To understand this we must first learn about the molecule that contains instructions that control all body functions
- Life on Earth is incredibly diverse, and this diversity is due to the presence of DNA

### Slide 22: Cell organisation
- A genome – is found in every cell nucleus.
- To fit all this information into a cell's tiny nucleus, DNA is condensed and coiled around proteins.
- This pulls the DNA into tightly packed structures called chromosomes.
- DNA provides instructions for the functioning of an organism
  - sequence of instructions for making proteins
  - proteins needed for life processes

### Slide 23: Proteins
Actin and microtubules are two proteins that provide structure to cells

### Slide 24: What is DNA?

### Slide 25: Deoxyribonucleic acid: DNA
- DNA molecule found in the nucleus of cells
- Codes for production of proteins
- Controls instructions for body functions and characteristics
- Composed of two strands shaped like a ladder
- Known as a double helix

### Slide 26: DNA STRUCTURE
DNA has the same structure in all organisms. It is made up of smaller molecules called a nucleotide (monomer). Therefore, DNA can be considered a polymer made up of smaller, repeating sub-units which are the nucleotides.

In DNA, there are 4 different base types:
- THYMINE
- CYTOSINE
- ADENINE
- GUANINE

Each DNA nucleotide is made up of three components:
- A NITROGENOUS BASE
- A PHOSPHATE GROUP
- A DEOXYRIBOSE SUGAR

DNA is unique as it contains different orders of nucleotides. A DNA sequence is represented by the first letter of each base eg: ATTCGATGC

**Notes:** The nitrogenous bases are what makes each individual unique - everyone has a different sequence of nitrogenous bases and the order is what causes different characteristics.

### Slide 27: Complementary Base Pairing
To make the double helix, two strands of DNA are bonded via their nitrogenous bases.
Nitrogenous bases have a complimentary pair.

- Adenine (A) bonds to Thymine (T)
- Cytosine (C) bonds to Guanine (G)

HINT: Think "Apple in the Tree" and "Car in the Garage" to remember the pairing rule

The two strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between the complimentary nitrogenous bases.
These make up the 'rungs' of the ladder, therefore the 'backbone' is made up of alternating deoxyribose sugars and phosphate groups.

**Notes:** The nucleotides are organized to form the double helix structure. This looks like a twisted ladder. The sides (strands) of DNA are formed by alternating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups of the nucleotides, creating a sugar-phosphate backbone.

### Slide 28: NOW YOU TRY - QUICK CHECK

### Slide 55: Understanding genetic mutations
Learning goals
1. Describe a genetic mutation
2. Distinguish between types of mutations: substitution, insertion, deletion
3. Describe chromosomal mutations

### Slide 56: MUTATIONS OF DNA
Mutations are a permanent change in the DNA and it may be in one gene or in a number of genes (i.e. part or all of a chromosome).

### Slide 57: MUTAGENS
Mutagens are physical, chemical or biological agents that change the DNA of an organism and thus cause a mutation.
As many mutations cause cancer, many mutagens are also carcinogens.

EXAMPLES OF MUTAGENS ARE:
- Radiation - gamma, X-ray, UV
- Arsenic, cadmium metals
- Viruses such as HPV (Human Papilloma Virus)
- Cigarette smoke and alcohol (ethanol)
- Certain strains of bacteria (Helicobacter pylori)

### Slide 58: MUTATIONS
Most often, genetic material is stable, occasionally however, a change can occur – this is called a mutation.
Mutations change the instructions that are encoded in genes.
This CAN result in a defective protein.

### Slide 59: TYPES OF MUTATIONS
**Genetic Mutations:** A genetic mutation is a change that occurs in a gene.
**Frameshift Mutations:** A frameshift mutation is when sequences of DNA have been shifted due to substitutions, insertions and deletions
**Chromosomal Mutations:** A chromosomal mutation is a caused by the centromere failing to separate during meiosis.

### Slide 60: GENETIC MUTATIONS
If the change occurs in a gene then it is called a genetic mutation. This mutation can involve substituting one nucleotide for another (as seen below) or deleting or adding a nucleotide.

### Slide 61: GENETIC MUTATIONS - Point Mutation
A point mutation occurs when one base substitutes for another. As the genetic code is read in groups of three (called triplets), this may or may not influence the final protein.
In this example, the sixth base, T, was substituted by R. In DNA it might be a G substituted for A. This small change will be passed on to the RNA but may not affect the order of amino acids in a protein.

### Slide 62: SICKLE CELL
Sickle cell anaemia is a point substitution that affects the final protein. It causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen.
The gene that makes haemoglobin, which carries oxygen around the body, has substituted an adenine for a thymine (T). The code in the DNA now reads CAC instead of CTC (See image to the right).

### Slides 63-64: FRAMESHIFT MUTATIONS
A deletion of the sixth base (T) in the example would result in: [shift]
An addition of an extra R would result in the code becoming: [shift]
These are called frameshift mutations because the triplet reading frame has been shifted along the DNA strand.

### Slide 15: 2.3 Patterns of inheritance - Punnett square
A Punnett square is a specialised grid to show genetic crosses
- Used to predict outcome of cross-breeding organisms with certain traits

## FILE 3: Mitosis_.pptx

### Slide 1: Year 10 biology - Cell reproduction: MITOSIS

### Slide 2: Learning goals
- Identify the importance of cellular replication
- Explain the role of mitosis
- Identify and describe stages of mitosis

### Slide 3: Cellular divison
Have you ever wondered how organisms (like humans) have grown from just one single cell?
Have you ever thought about how your body has grown over time, or how it repairs itself when you are injured?

The answer to this is mitosis!

Mitosis is used for:
- Growth
- Replacement
- Repair
- Asexual reproduction

### Slide 5: Mitosis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ldPgEfAHI

When mitosis is completed, two genetically identical cells are produced. It is a fundamental process during growth and tissue repair.
It is the most common form of cell division in somatic eukaryotic cells (those that will not become sex cells).

### Slide 6: Phases of mitosis
Remember: PMAT!
- Prophase
- Metaphase
- Anaphase
- Telophase

### Slide 7: Phases of mitosis
Identify and draw each of the cell cycle stages in your books!
- Interphase
- Prophase
- Metaphase
- Anaphase
- Telophase

### Slide 8: Interphase
Getting the cell ready to divide!
- Cell grows and prepares for division
- Include series of stages
- Checks for DNA damage
- Checks cell large enough
- Checks cell has enough energy

### Slide 9: Prophase
- The nuclear envelope dissolves (separates chromosomes from rest of cell)
- Chromatin condenses (sister chromatids join, form 'x' shape)
- Mitotic spindle forms

### Slide 10: Metaphase
- Chromosomes align at centre of cell (Equator or metaphase plate)
- Microtubules attach to each centromere of the chromosomes.
- Cell checks that all chromosomes aligned (ensures daughter cells will split evenly, if unaligned division paused till fixed)

### Slide 11: Anaphase
- Centrosomes pull chromosomes pair apart
- Sister chromatids pulled to opposite poles (sides) of cell
- Microtubules elongate (cell becomes longer)

### Slide 12: Telophase
- New membrane forms around nuclei (opposite ends of cell)
- Chromosomes decondense (unwind and relax). Spindle fibers break apart
- Think of this stage as the reverse of prophase
- Cell continues to stretch (Preparing to separate cell in two)

### Slide 13: Cytokinesis
- Division of cytoplasm to form two new cells
- A cleavage furrow forms (separating the two daughter cells, same number of chromosomes as the parent cell)

### Slide 17: Modelling mitosis
Use modelling clay to construct each of the phases of mitosis
Make sure that you can correctly construct each phase
Write a short description of what your model is showing!

## FILE 4: Meiosis.pptx

### Slide 3: Quick check: Mitosis
1. How many daughter cells are produced at the end of mitosis?
   A. 1 | B. 2 | C. 4 | D. 8

2. What is the structure responsible for pulling the sister chromatids apart during anaphase?
   A. Nucleus | B. Spindle fibres | C. Mitochondria | D. Cell Membrane

### Slide 4: Learning intentions
- Define gametes as sex cells, sperm and ova (egg)
- Recognise that genetic information if passed to offspring through gametes
- Understand the role of meiosis in gamete formation

### Slide 5: Why do children look different from their parents?
What is the cause of genetic diversity?

### Slide 6: Meiosis
For sexual reproduction to occur gametes must be produced

Gametes are sex cells:
- Ova (egg) produced in ovaries
- Sperm produced in testes

Gametes contain half the diploid number of chromosomes
Somatic cells have two copies of every chromosome

### Slide 7:
Only one copy of each chromosome
Fertilisation produces zygote (fertilised egg) with one chromosome from each parent
This means that one chromosome from each pair must be present in each gamete produced

Zygotes are a diploid cell
Contain two sets of chromosomes (23 x 2 = 46 in humans)

### Slide 8: Producing gametes through meiosis
Meiosis occurs in two stages:
- Meiosis I
- Meiosis II

Meiosis I occurs when one cell divides into two
Meiosis II follows, involving those two cells to further divide into four

### Slide 10: Meiosis I
KEY TERMS:
- **Homologous chromosome:** pairs of chromosomes which carry the same genes, but not necessarily the same version (allele)
- **Crossing over:** where homologous chromosomes pair up so closely that they physically swap sections
- **Random assortment:** homologous chromosomes line up in random orientation (left, right, etc)

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Interphase | A diploid cell replicates its DNA to form sister chromatid chromosomes. |
| Prophase I | Homologous chromosomes pair up, allowing crossing over. |
| Metaphase I | Homologous chromosomes pair up in random assortment at the cell equator. |
| Anaphase I | The cell begins to divide, separating homologous chromosomes pairs. |
| Telophase I | The cell fully divides, forming two haploid daughter cells with sister chromatid chromosomes. |

### Slide 11: Crossing over?
- Crossing over results in different combinations of DNA
- Crossing over is the source of variation in sexually reproducing organisms
- Produces new combinations of genes

### Slide 12: Providing variation
Creating genetic variation
The random assortment and crossing over events of meiosis I are key to producing unique individuals.

When homologous chromosomes line up during metaphase I, they align randomly. This means each human gamete receives one of over 8 million combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes!

New combinations also form when homologous pairs swap sections with each other. This crossing over creates chromatids with a combination of maternal and paternal alleles, rather than chromatids purely from one parent or the other.

**DID YOU KNOW?** One set of human parents is capable of producing more genetically different zygotes than the number of human beings that have ever existed!

### Slide 14: Meiosis II
The final stage of gamete production is meiosis II. This mostly follows the same process as meiosis I, with a couple of key differences:
1. Each cell starts with only one chromosome from each homologous pair, so it is already haploid (n).
2. Sister chromatids are separated, with matching chromatids pulled to opposite sides.

The end result is four haploid daughter cells with single chromatid chromosomes (n).

### Slide 15: Meiosis I: Prophase
- Chromosomes condense
- Nuclear membrane disappears
- Spindle fibres form and attach to centromere
- Homologous chromosomes move toward each other
- Crossing over occurs

### Slide 16: Meiosis I: Metaphase
- Homologous chromosomes align at equator (centre of cell)
- Random orientation (Allowing for further genetic variation)

### Slide 17: Meiosis I: Anaphase
- Homologous chromosomes separate
- Pulled to opposite poles of cell (ends)
- Sister chromatids remain attached

### Slide 18: Meiosis I: Telophase
- Chromosomes at opposite poles
- Nuclear membrane reforms
- Chromosomes decondense
- Two haploid daughter cells

### Slide 19: Meiosis II
- Two cells formed during Meiosis I contain chromosome from each homologous pair
- Chromosomes still joined by centromere
- Meiosis II is the stage in which centromere splits

### Slide 20: Prophase II
- Chromosomes condense
- Spindle fibre forms (Attaches to centromere)
- Nuclear membrane disappears

### Slide 21: Metaphase II
Chromosomes align at equator of cell (centre)

### Slide 22: Anaphase II
- Sister chromatids separate from centromere
- Sister chromatids move to opposite poles of cell

### Slide 23: Telophase II
- Chromatids reach opposite poles of cell
- Cytokinesis begins
- Following cytokinesis total of 4 daughter cells produced (Genetically unique)

## FILE 5: Inheritance.pptx

### Slide 1: DNA & Genetics - Patterns of inheritance

### Slide 2: Learning Objectives
- Draw and label a Punnett square and interpret the phenotypic and genotypic ratios of offspring
- Use Punnett square to determine the likelihood of offspring inheriting characteristics from parents (dominant, recessive and co-dominant)

### Slide 3: Traits and Alleles
Traits are alternative/different forms of a gene.
They are located at the same place on the chromosome called an allele!

### Slide 4: ALLELES
An allele is one of two or more versions of DNA sequence at a given genomic location.
An individual inherits two alleles, one from each parent, for any given genomic location where such variation exists.

### Slide 5: GENOTYPE VS PHENOTYPE
BB, bb and Bb represent the eye's genotypes – the genetic information or code carried by an individual. The blue or brown colour is the phenotype – the observable characteristics of the individual.

**PHENOTYPE:** Outward expression appearance of a particular gene or characteristic.
Eg: blue eyes

**GENOTYPE:** Genetic make-up of the individual or genes for a particular characteristic.
The alleles that the individual has.

### Slide 6: Types of Inheritance
**DOMINANT:** BB or Bb or WW or Ww
**RECESSIVE:** bb or ww
**CO-DOMINANCE:** BW

Complete dominance (Dominant and recessive):
- Two alleles influence the one trait.
- The dominant allele 'overrides' the recessive allele and the dominant trait is expressed (phenotype).
- If two recessive alleles are present, only then will the recessive trait be expressed.

### Slide 7: ALLELES - Homozygous and Heterozygous
When an individual has two of the same alleles, such as the RR and rr combinations, then the individual is said to be **homozygous** for that allele.
Individuals with the Rr combination of alleles are **heterozygous**.

### Slide 8: PUNNETT SQUARES
A Punnett square is one way of showing all the possible types of offspring that could result from a mating between both parents.

In a Punnett square, the possible gametes produced by one parent are shown across the top. The gametes from the other parent are shown down the side.

### Slide 9: PUNNETT SQUARES AND INHERITANCE
An individual that is heterozygous produces gametes of two types.
- Half the gametes carry the allele for the dominant trait. The other half of the gametes carries the allele for the recessive trait.

The Punnett square below shows that both red-flowered and white-flowered plants can be produced in the next (F2) generation. The expected proportion is 3/4 red flowers and 1/4 white flowers, although the exact proportions might differ in reality.

### Slide 10: PREDICTING A CROSS
It is possible to predict the results of a genetic cross if you know:
- the genotype of the parents
- relationship between the alleles of the trait of interest

### Slide 12-13: CO-DOMINANCE AND BLOOD TYPING
Learning Objectives: Define co-dominance and interpret punnett squares of blood typing.

### Slide 14: CO-DOMINANCE
Inheritance does not always involve complete dominance. Sometimes both traits are expressed together and said to be equally expressed. This is known as co-dominance, a form of heterozygous breeding whereby both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype.

Co-dominance can be observed within the chickens in the image below. The colours black and white are both dominant – their alleles are given in capital letters. When you cross a pure black chicken (BB) with a pure white chicken (WW) the offspring will be heterozygous (BW). The heterozygous chicken expressed both colours equally with a phenotype of both black and white feathers!

### Slide 15: BLOOD TYPING
The inheritance of your blood type is a codominance trait that involves multiple alleles.
Red blood cells have proteins on the surface called antigens that determine whether are blood is type A, B, AB or O.

### Slide 16: Blood Type Inheritance
Each individual inherits one copy of the ABO blood type gene from their biological mother and one copy of the ABO blood type gene from their biological father – each person has two copies of the ABO gene.

### Slide 17: Determining Blood type through the use of Punnett squares!

### Slide 18-19: PEDIGREE ANALYSIS
Learning Objective: Explain and draw a family pedigree for complete dominance using the pedigree rules and determine the genotype of an individual from a pedigree

### Slide 20: Pedigree Charts
A pedigree chart is a diagram that shows a family relationship and how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next. Pedigree charts allow the investigation of the frequency and occurrence of a particular gene over many generations – this helps determine whether traits are dominant or recessive!

Pedigrees are a useful way to help determine how a trait may be inherited.

**Dominant traits** cannot 'skip' generations — in order to have a dominant trait, at least one parent of an affected individual must also have it (unless it is a new mutation). The trait can be seen in each generation. Once it vanishes from a family, it does not suddenly reappear.

**Recessive traits** can 'skip' generations; that is, a child can show the trait without either parents having it.

Autosomal traits do not usually show an obvious sex skew.
Sex-linked traits often have a sex skew.

# SUMMARY OF KEY CONCEPTS ACROSS ALL FILES

## DNA Structure
- DNA = Deoxyribonucleic acid
- Double helix structure (twisted ladder)
- Made of nucleotides (monomer units)
- Each nucleotide has: phosphate group, deoxyribose sugar, nitrogenous base
- Four bases: Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine
- Complementary base pairing: A-T, C-G
- Sugar-phosphate backbone
- Hydrogen bonds hold strands together

## Genes and Chromosomes
- Gene = section of DNA coding for a protein
- Genome = complete set of DNA in an organism
- ~25,000 genes in human cells
- Chromosomes = tightly packaged DNA
- Humans: 46 chromosomes (23 pairs)
- 22 pairs autosomes + 1 pair sex chromosomes
- Sex chromosomes: XX (female), XY (male)
- Homologous chromosomes = matching pairs

## Cell Division
**Mitosis:**
- Body cell division
- Produces 2 identical diploid cells
- Stages: IPMAT (Interphase, Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase)
- Used for: growth, repair, replacement, asexual reproduction

**Meiosis:**
- Gamete production
- Produces 4 unique haploid cells
- Two divisions: Meiosis I and II
- Introduces variation through crossing over and random assortment

## Inheritance
- Allele = version of a gene
- Genotype = genetic makeup (BB, Bb, bb)
- Phenotype = observable characteristic
- Homozygous = same alleles (BB or bb)
- Heterozygous = different alleles (Bb)
- Dominant = always expressed
- Recessive = only expressed when homozygous
- Codominance = both alleles expressed equally
- Punnett squares predict offspring ratios
- Pedigree charts track inheritance patterns

## Mutations

TARGET: Use knowledge in new situations.
TEST: Can student use procedures, concepts, or principles in unfamiliar contexts?
QUESTION TYPES: Predict outcomes, solve problems, apply procedures, use in scenarios.
STEMS: "What would happen if...", "In this situation, you would...", "Apply X to solve...", "Predict the result..."
REQUIRE: Novel scenarios not seen in teaching materials. Test transfer of learning.

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can outline benefits of karyotyping
CODE: 2.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
A karyotype is an organised image of an individual's chromosomes, arranged by size and banding patterns. Karyotyping can identify chromosomal abnormalities such as extra chromosomes, missing chromosomes, or structural changes.

WHY (importance):
Karyotyping is used in prenatal diagnosis to detect conditions like Down syndrome (trisomy 21), in diagnosing genetic disorders, and in cancer research. It provides visual evidence of chromosomal changes that affect health.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A karyotype of a person with Down syndrome would show three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. A karyotype can also determine biological sex by showing whether the 23rd pair is XX (female) or XY (male).

SUBTOPIC: Genes and Chromosomes
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores how genetic information is organised within cells, from individual genes to chromosomes, and how this organisation allows cells to store and access genetic instructions efficiently.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the relationship between DNA, genes, and chromosomes explains how genetic information is packaged, inherited, and expressed. This knowledge is essential for understanding heredity and genetic disorders.

TOPIC: Genetics
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: Year 10
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Understanding how genetic information in DNA is organised into genes and chromosomes, passed to offspring through cell division, and inherited according to predictable patterns.

chromosomes separate
Anaphase is when the
chromosomes separate and are
pulled away from each other to
opposite sides of the cell.

## FILE 1: Genetics_Intro.pptx

### Slide 1: Have you ever wondered…
**Notes:** Activity: Are you ready?
List 5 questions you have about genetics.
Share your ideas with the class

### Slide 2: What does it mean to be alive?

### Slide 3: Activity: Is it alive?
How do you know if something is living or not?
1. Form a small group – 4 or less
2. Collect object cards
3. Determine whether the objects are living or not
4. As a group can you agree on what is means to be alive?

What is life?
5 core principles of life - Paul Nurse

### Slide 4: MRS GREEN
| Movement | All living thigs move |
| Respiration | Obtaining energy from food |
| Sensitivity | Detecting changes in surroundings |
| Growth | All living things grow |
| Reproduction | Producing offspring |
| Equilibrium | Maintaining stable internal environment |
| Excretion | Removal of waste |
| Nutrition | Extracting nutrients |

### Slide 5-6: MRS GREEN Examples (Plant/Animal)
Respiration, Sensitivity, Growth, Movement, Reproduction, Equilibrium, Excretion, Nutrition

### Slide 7: Cell structure

### Slide 8: Learning objectives
1. Identify the location and role of major organelles in a cell
2. Differentiate between plant and animal cells

### Slide 9: CELLS ARE THE SMALLEST UNIT OF LIFE
All living things on earth are made up of cells.
Cells have specialized internal structures called organelles which allows the cell to stay alive and function efficiently.
All cells come from pre-existing cells

### Slide 10: Categorising cells
Thinking back to year 8, what can you remember?

### Slide 11: ANIMAL CELL / PLANT CELL
We can classify cells as either being an animal or a plant cell. These two cells share many similar components, however, some are unique to each. We call these components organelles. They are small units inside the cell that carry out specific functions.

### Slide 12: Inside the cell
Cells perform specific functions for survival:
- Repair damage
- Produce energy
- Excrete waste
- Build proteins

For efficiency cells have specialised structures known as organelles
Suspended in a gel like substances known as the cytoplasm
Organelles work together to perform the function of the cell!

### Slides 13-16: Types of organelles
[Various organelle diagrams]

### Slide 17: Why do we have lots of tiny cells rather than a few big ones?
**Notes:** A cell's main job is to take in nutrients, which it needs to make proteins, grow, and repair itself. To perform their roles, cells need a bigger surface area (more outside space) compared to their volume (inside space) to make it easier for the cell to get nutrients in and waste out quickly.

### Slide 18: Biology: DNA & Genetics
Year 10 Science

### Slide 19: Why do species look and behave so differently?

### Slide 20: Learning objectives
1. Explain how DNA relates to structure and function of organisms
2. Describe the structure of DNA
3. Explain the complementary base pair rule

### Slide 21: DNA: The Chemical code of life
- Genetics is the study of how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next
- To understand this we must first learn about the molecule that contains instructions that control all body functions
- Life on Earth is incredibly diverse, and this diversity is due to the presence of DNA

### Slide 22: Cell organisation
- A genome – is found in every cell nucleus.
- To fit all this information into a cell's tiny nucleus, DNA is condensed and coiled around proteins.
- This pulls the DNA into tightly packed structures called chromosomes.
- DNA provides instructions for the functioning of an organism
  - sequence of instructions for making proteins
  - proteins needed for life processes

### Slide 23: Proteins
Actin and microtubules are two proteins that provide structure to cells

### Slide 24: What is DNA?

### Slide 25: Deoxyribonucleic acid: DNA
- DNA molecule found in the nucleus of cells
- Codes for production of proteins
- Controls instructions for body functions and characteristics
- Composed of two strands shaped like a ladder
- Known as a double helix

### Slide 26: DNA STRUCTURE
DNA has the same structure in all organisms. It is made up of smaller molecules called a nucleotide (monomer). Therefore, DNA can be considered a polymer made up of smaller, repeating sub-units which are the nucleotides.

In DNA, there are 4 different base types:
- THYMINE
- CYTOSINE
- ADENINE
- GUANINE

Each DNA nucleotide is made up of three components:
- A NITROGENOUS BASE
- A PHOSPHATE GROUP
- A DEOXYRIBOSE SUGAR

DNA is unique as it contains different orders of nucleotides. A DNA sequence is represented by the first letter of each base eg: ATTCGATGC

**Notes:** The nitrogenous bases are what makes each individual unique - everyone has a different sequence of nitrogenous bases and the order is what causes different characteristics.

### Slide 27: Complementary Base Pairing
To make the double helix, two strands of DNA are bonded via their nitrogenous bases.
Nitrogenous bases have a complimentary pair.

- Adenine (A) bonds to Thymine (T)
- Cytosine (C) bonds to Guanine (G)

HINT: Think "Apple in the Tree" and "Car in the Garage" to remember the pairing rule

The two strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between the complimentary nitrogenous bases.
These make up the 'rungs' of the ladder, therefore the 'backbone' is made up of alternating deoxyribose sugars and phosphate groups.

**Notes:** The nucleotides are organized to form the double helix structure. This looks like a twisted ladder. The sides (strands) of DNA are formed by alternating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups of the nucleotides, creating a sugar-phosphate backbone.

### Slide 28: NOW YOU TRY - QUICK CHECK
Have a go at completing the complementary sequence for the below:
A T A T C A T G C G G G

- This collection of genes contains all the information needed to build and maintain you

### Slides 38-39: [Diagrams]

### Slide 40: Where can I find a gene?

### Slide 41: Chromosomes
- Chromosomes are structures that hold genetic information

### Slide 55: Understanding genetic mutations
Learning goals
1. Describe a genetic mutation
2. Distinguish between types of mutations: substitution, insertion, deletion
3. Describe chromosomal mutations

### Slide 56: MUTATIONS OF DNA
Mutations are a permanent change in the DNA and it may be in one gene or in a number of genes (i.e. part or all of a chromosome).

### Slide 57: MUTAGENS
Mutagens are physical, chemical or biological agents that change the DNA of an organism and thus cause a mutation.
As many mutations cause cancer, many mutagens are also carcinogens.

EXAMPLES OF MUTAGENS ARE:
- Radiation - gamma, X-ray, UV
- Arsenic, cadmium metals
- Viruses such as HPV (Human Papilloma Virus)
- Cigarette smoke and alcohol (ethanol)
- Certain strains of bacteria (Helicobacter pylori)

### Slide 58: MUTATIONS
Most often, genetic material is stable, occasionally however, a change can occur – this is called a mutation.
Mutations change the instructions that are encoded in genes.
This CAN result in a defective protein.

### Slide 59: TYPES OF MUTATIONS
**Genetic Mutations:** A genetic mutation is a change that occurs in a gene.
**Frameshift Mutations:** A frameshift mutation is when sequences of DNA have been shifted due to substitutions, insertions and deletions
**Chromosomal Mutations:** A chromosomal mutation is a caused by the centromere failing to separate during meiosis.

### Slide 60: GENETIC MUTATIONS
If the change occurs in a gene then it is called a genetic mutation. This mutation can involve substituting one nucleotide for another (as seen below) or deleting or adding a nucleotide.

### Slide 61: GENETIC MUTATIONS - Point Mutation
A point mutation occurs when one base substitutes for another. As the genetic code is read in groups of three (called triplets), this may or may not influence the final protein.
In this example, the sixth base, T, was substituted by R. In DNA it might be a G substituted for A. This small change will be passed on to the RNA but may not affect the order of amino acids in a protein.

### Slide 62: SICKLE CELL
Sickle cell anaemia is a point substitution that affects the final protein. It causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen.
The gene that makes haemoglobin, which carries oxygen around the body, has substituted an adenine for a thymine (T). The code in the DNA now reads CAC instead of CTC (See image to the right).

### Slides 63-64: FRAMESHIFT MUTATIONS
A deletion of the sixth base (T) in the example would result in: [shift]
An addition of an extra R would result in the code becoming: [shift]
These are called frameshift mutations because the triplet reading frame has been shifted along the DNA strand.

2. New nucleotides are added following complementary base pairing rules (Catalysed by DNA polymerase)
3. Result is two identical strands of DNA

### Slide 10: 2.2 Passing on genetic information - Mitosis
- Cell division of body (somatic) cells
- One round of division results in diploid (2n) daughter cells
- Stages of mitosis (IPMAT): Interphase, Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase
- After mitosis: cytokinesis

### Slide 11: 2.2 Passing on genetic information - Meiosis
- Cell division of gametes (sex cells) for reproduction
- Introduces variation through recombination
- Two rounds of division result in haploid (n) daughter cells

### Slide 12: 2.2 Passing on genetic information
**Karyotype:** An image of an organism's chromosomes, arranged according to size and gene band patterns
- Homologous chromosomes are pairs of matching chromosomes (one is inherited from each parent)

**Autosomes:** Any chromosome that is not a sex chromosome (Chromosome pairs 1 to 22 in humans)

**Sex chromosomes:** Chromosomes that determine the sex of an organism (The 23rd pair in humans - XX in females, XY in males)

### Slide 13: 2.3 Patterns of inheritance
Learning goals:
- To be able to define the terms homozygous, heterozygous, dominant and recessive with respect to genetic inheritance.
- To be able to interpret a Punnett square or pedigree to identify a possible genotype and phenotype.
- To explain the codominance of blood groups.

### Slide 14: 2.3 Patterns of inheritance
**Homozygous:** Having two identical alleles at a locus
**Heterozygous:** Having two different alleles at a locus
**Dominant:** A characteristic in which the allele responsible is always expressed in the phenotype
**Recessive:** A characteristic in which the allele responsible is only expressed in the phenotype if there is no dominant allele present (i.e., homozygous genotypes)

### Slide 15: 2.3 Patterns of inheritance - Punnett square
A Punnett square is a specialised grid to show genetic crosses
- Used to predict outcome of cross-breeding organisms with certain traits
- You need to know the genotype of the parents and then work out what genetic information they could pass on to their offspring via the gametes

F1 genotype: 50% Bb, 50% bb
F1 phenotype: 50% black mice, 50% white mice

### Slide 16: 2.3 Patterns of inheritance - Codominance
Both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype
E.g. crossing a pure black chicken with a pure white chicken gives a speckled heterozygote with black and white feathers

### Slide 17: 2.3 Patterns of inheritance - Blood type
In humans, blood type is a codominant trait
- Red blood cells have proteins on the surface called antigens, which determine whether our blood type is A, B, AB or O
- Inherited genes code for different antigens on red blood cells

### Slide 18: 2.3 Patterns of inheritance - Pedigree
A chart formed to study patterns of inheritance over generations
- Males are represented by squares
- Females are represented by circles
- Affected individuals are coloured black
- Autosomal recessive / Autosomal dominant

### Slide 19: 2.4 Changes in DNA
Learning goals:
- To be able to distinguish germline and somatic mutations.
- To be able to recall types of point and chromosomal mutations.
- To explore the applications of DNA manipulation.

### Slide 20: 2.4 Changes in DNA
**Mutation:** A change in the genetic code of a cell
**Germline mutation:** A mutation of DNA in gametes, which can be inherited
**Somatic mutation:** A mutation that occurs in somatic (body) cells, which cannot be inherited

### Slide 21: 2.4 Changes in DNA - Point mutation
A mutation in which a single nucleotide is changed
Four types:
- Substitution
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Inversion

### Slide 22: 2.4 Changes in DNA - Chromosome mutation
A mutation involving large segments of DNA
Five types:
- Duplication
- Inversion
- Deletion
- Insertion
- Translocation

### Slide 23: 2.4 Changes in DNA - Manipulating DNA
**Genetic engineering:** Technology that allows genetic material to be manipulated and enables genes to be transferred between any two species
E.g. editing crops for nutrition using CRISPR

**Genetically modified organism:** An organism that has had its genome altered by humans
E.g. plants engineered to grow with less water

### Slide 24: 2.4 Changes in DNA
**Transgenic organism:** An organism that possesses a 'foreign' gene or segment of 'foreign' DNA in its genome as a result of human experimentation
E.g. hamster cells engineered to contain the human gene that codes for FSH, a hormone used in IVF treatments

**Gene therapy:** A process by which a copy of a functional gene is introduced into an organism
E.g. to treat inherited disorders like cystic fibrosis

## FILE 3: Mitosis_.pptx

### Slide 1: Year 10 biology - Cell reproduction: MITOSIS

### Slide 2: Learning goals
- Identify the importance of cellular replication
- Explain the role of mitosis
- Identify and describe stages of mitosis

### Slide 3: Cellular divison
Have you ever wondered how organisms (like humans) have grown from just one single cell?
Have you ever thought about how your body has grown over time, or how it repairs itself when you are injured?

The answer to this is mitosis!

Mitosis is used for:
- Growth
- Replacement
- Repair
- Asexual reproduction

### Slide 5: Mitosis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ldPgEfAHI

When mitosis is completed, two genetically identical cells are produced. It is a fundamental process during growth and tissue repair.
It is the most common form of cell division in somatic eukaryotic cells (those that will not become sex cells).

### Slide 6: Phases of mitosis
Remember: PMAT!
- Prophase
- Metaphase
- Anaphase
- Telophase

### Slide 7: Phases of mitosis
Identify and draw each of the cell cycle stages in your books!
- Interphase
- Prophase
- Metaphase
- Anaphase
- Telophase

### Slide 8: Interphase
Getting the cell ready to divide!
- Cell grows and prepares for division
- Include series of stages
- Checks for DNA damage
- Checks cell large enough
- Checks cell has enough energy

### Slide 9: Prophase
- The nuclear envelope dissolves (separates chromosomes from rest of cell)
- Chromatin condenses (sister chromatids join, form 'x' shape)
- Mitotic spindle forms

### Slide 10: Metaphase
- Chromosomes align at centre of cell (Equator or metaphase plate)
- Microtubules attach to each centromere of the chromosomes.
- Cell checks that all chromosomes aligned (ensures daughter cells will split evenly, if unaligned division paused till fixed)

### Slide 11: Anaphase
- Centrosomes pull chromosomes pair apart
- Sister chromatids pulled to opposite poles (sides) of cell
- Microtubules elongate (cell becomes longer)

### Slide 12: Telophase
- New membrane forms around nuclei (opposite ends of cell)
- Chromosomes decondense (unwind and relax). Spindle fibers break apart
- Think of this stage as the reverse of prophase
- Cell continues to stretch (Preparing to separate cell in two)

### Slide 13: Cytokinesis
- Division of cytoplasm to form two new cells
- A cleavage furrow forms (separating the two daughter cells, same number of chromosomes as the parent cell)

### Slide 17: Modelling mitosis
Use modelling clay to construct each of the phases of mitosis
Make sure that you can correctly construct each phase
Write a short description of what your model is showing!

## FILE 4: Meiosis.pptx

### Slide 3: Quick check: Mitosis
1. How many daughter cells are produced at the end of mitosis?
   A. 1 | B. 2 | C. 4 | D. 8

2. What is the structure responsible for pulling the sister chromatids apart during anaphase?
   A. Nucleus | B. Spindle fibres | C. Mitochondria | D. Cell Membrane

### Slide 4: Learning intentions
- Define gametes as sex cells, sperm and ova (egg)
- Recognise that genetic information if passed to offspring through gametes
- Understand the role of meiosis in gamete formation

### Slide 5: Why do children look different from their parents?
What is the cause of genetic diversity?

### Slide 6: Meiosis
For sexual reproduction to occur gametes must be produced

Gametes are sex cells:
- Ova (egg) produced in ovaries
- Sperm produced in testes

Gametes contain half the diploid number of chromosomes
Somatic cells have two copies of every chromosome

### Slide 7:
Only one copy of each chromosome
Fertilisation produces zygote (fertilised egg) with one chromosome from each parent
This means that one chromosome from each pair must be present in each gamete produced

Zygotes are a diploid cell
Contain two sets of chromosomes (23 x 2 = 46 in humans)

### Slide 8: Producing gametes through meiosis
Meiosis occurs in two stages:
- Meiosis I
- Meiosis II

Meiosis I occurs when one cell divides into two
Meiosis II follows, involving those two cells to further divide into four

### Slide 10: Meiosis I
KEY TERMS:
- **Homologous chromosome:** pairs of chromosomes which carry the same genes, but not necessarily the same version (allele)
- **Crossing over:** where homologous chromosomes pair up so closely that they physically swap sections
- **Random assortment:** homologous chromosomes line up in random orientation (left, right, etc)

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Interphase | A diploid cell replicates its DNA to form sister chromatid chromosomes. |
| Prophase I | Homologous chromosomes pair up, allowing crossing over. |
| Metaphase I | Homologous chromosomes pair up in random assortment at the cell equator. |
| Anaphase I | The cell begins to divide, separating homologous chromosomes pairs. |
| Telophase I | The cell fully divides, forming two haploid daughter cells with sister chromatid chromosomes. |

### Slide 11: Crossing over?
- Crossing over results in different combinations of DNA
- Crossing over is the source of variation in sexually reproducing organisms
- Produces new combinations of genes

### Slide 12: Providing variation
Creating genetic variation
The random assortment and crossing over events of meiosis I are key to producing unique individuals.

When homologous chromosomes line up during metaphase I, they align randomly. This means each human gamete receives one of over 8 million combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes!

New combinations also form when homologous pairs swap sections with each other. This crossing over creates chromatids with a combination of maternal and paternal alleles, rather than chromatids purely from one parent or the other.

**DID YOU KNOW?** One set of human parents is capable of producing more genetically different zygotes than the number of human beings that have ever existed!

### Slide 14: Meiosis II
The final stage of gamete production is meiosis II. This mostly follows the same process as meiosis I, with a couple of key differences:
1. Each cell starts with only one chromosome from each homologous pair, so it is already haploid (n).
2. Sister chromatids are separated, with matching chromatids pulled to opposite sides.

The end result is four haploid daughter cells with single chromatid chromosomes (n).

### Slide 15: Meiosis I: Prophase
- Chromosomes condense
- Nuclear membrane disappears
- Spindle fibres form and attach to centromere
- Homologous chromosomes move toward each other
- Crossing over occurs

### Slide 16: Meiosis I: Metaphase
- Homologous chromosomes align at equator (centre of cell)
- Random orientation (Allowing for further genetic variation)

### Slide 17: Meiosis I: Anaphase
- Homologous chromosomes separate
- Pulled to opposite poles of cell (ends)
- Sister chromatids remain attached

### Slide 18: Meiosis I: Telophase
- Chromosomes at opposite poles
- Nuclear membrane reforms
- Chromosomes decondense
- Two haploid daughter cells

### Slide 19: Meiosis II
- Two cells formed during Meiosis I contain chromosome from each homologous pair
- Chromosomes still joined by centromere
- Meiosis II is the stage in which centromere splits

### Slide 20: Prophase II
- Chromosomes condense
- Spindle fibre forms (Attaches to centromere)
- Nuclear membrane disappears

### Slide 21: Metaphase II
Chromosomes align at equator of cell (centre)

### Slide 22: Anaphase II
- Sister chromatids separate from centromere
- Sister chromatids move to opposite poles of cell

### Slide 23: Telophase II
- Chromatids reach opposite poles of cell
- Cytokinesis begins
- Following cytokinesis total of 4 daughter cells produced (Genetically unique)

## FILE 5: Inheritance.pptx

### Slide 1: DNA & Genetics - Patterns of inheritance

### Slide 2: Learning Objectives
- Draw and label a Punnett square and interpret the phenotypic and genotypic ratios of offspring
- Use Punnett square to determine the likelihood of offspring inheriting characteristics from parents (dominant, recessive and co-dominant)

### Slide 3: Traits and Alleles
Traits are alternative/different forms of a gene.
They are located at the same place on the chromosome called an allele!

### Slide 4: ALLELES
An allele is one of two or more versions of DNA sequence at a given genomic location.
An individual inherits two alleles, one from each parent, for any given genomic location where such variation exists.

### Slide 5: GENOTYPE VS PHENOTYPE
BB, bb and Bb represent the eye's genotypes – the genetic information or code carried by an individual. The blue or brown colour is the phenotype – the observable characteristics of the individual.

**PHENOTYPE:** Outward expression appearance of a particular gene or characteristic.
Eg: blue eyes

**GENOTYPE:** Genetic make-up of the individual or genes for a particular characteristic.
The alleles that the individual has.

### Slide 6: Types of Inheritance
**DOMINANT:** BB or Bb or WW or Ww
**RECESSIVE:** bb or ww
**CO-DOMINANCE:** BW

Complete dominance (Dominant and recessive):
- Two alleles influence the one trait.
- The dominant allele 'overrides' the recessive allele and the dominant trait is expressed (phenotype).
- If two recessive alleles are present, only then will the recessive trait be expressed.

### Slide 7: ALLELES - Homozygous and Heterozygous
When an individual has two of the same alleles, such as the RR and rr combinations, then the individual is said to be **homozygous** for that allele.
Individuals with the Rr combination of alleles are **heterozygous**.

### Slide 8: PUNNETT SQUARES
A Punnett square is one way of showing all the possible types of offspring that could result from a mating between both parents.

In a Punnett square, the possible gametes produced by one parent are shown across the top. The gametes from the other parent are shown down the side.

### Slide 9: PUNNETT SQUARES AND INHERITANCE
An individual that is heterozygous produces gametes of two types.
- Half the gametes carry the allele for the dominant trait. The other half of the gametes carries the allele for the recessive trait.

The Punnett square below shows that both red-flowered and white-flowered plants can be produced in the next (F2) generation. The expected proportion is 3/4 red flowers and 1/4 white flowers, although the exact proportions might differ in reality.

### Slide 10: PREDICTING A CROSS
It is possible to predict the results of a genetic cross if you know:
- the genotype of the parents
- relationship between the alleles of the trait of interest

### Slide 12-13: CO-DOMINANCE AND BLOOD TYPING
Learning Objectives: Define co-dominance and interpret punnett squares of blood typing.

### Slide 14: CO-DOMINANCE
Inheritance does not always involve complete dominance. Sometimes both traits are expressed together and said to be equally expressed. This is known as co-dominance, a form of heterozygous breeding whereby both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype.

Co-dominance can be observed within the chickens in the image below. The colours black and white are both dominant – their alleles are given in capital letters. When you cross a pure black chicken (BB) with a pure white chicken (WW) the offspring will be heterozygous (BW). The heterozygous chicken expressed both colours equally with a phenotype of both black and white feathers!

### Slide 15: BLOOD TYPING
The inheritance of your blood type is a codominance trait that involves multiple alleles.
Red blood cells have proteins on the surface called antigens that determine whether are blood is type A, B, AB or O.

### Slide 16: Blood Type Inheritance
Each individual inherits one copy of the ABO blood type gene from their biological mother and one copy of the ABO blood type gene from their biological father – each person has two copies of the ABO gene.

### Slide 17: Determining Blood type through the use of Punnett squares!

### Slide 18-19: PEDIGREE ANALYSIS
Learning Objective: Explain and draw a family pedigree for complete dominance using the pedigree rules and determine the genotype of an individual from a pedigree

### Slide 20: Pedigree Charts
A pedigree chart is a diagram that shows a family relationship and how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next. Pedigree charts allow the investigation of the frequency and occurrence of a particular gene over many generations – this helps determine whether traits are dominant or recessive!

Pedigrees are a useful way to help determine how a trait may be inherited.

**Dominant traits** cannot 'skip' generations — in order to have a dominant trait, at least one parent of an affected individual must also have it (unless it is a new mutation). The trait can be seen in each generation. Once it vanishes from a family, it does not suddenly reappear.

**Recessive traits** can 'skip' generations; that is, a child can show the trait without either parents having it.

Autosomal traits do not usually show an obvious sex skew.
Sex-linked traits often have a sex skew.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
