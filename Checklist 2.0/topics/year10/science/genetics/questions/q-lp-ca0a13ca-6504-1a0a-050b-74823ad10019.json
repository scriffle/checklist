      "correct": "DNA must be replicated so each new cell gets a complete copy",

        {
          "answer": "DNA must be destroyed so new DNA can be created from scratch",

        {
          "answer": "DNA must be moved out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm permanently",
          "explanation": "DNA stays in the nucleus. Before division, it is replicated within the nucleus so both daughter cells receive copies."
