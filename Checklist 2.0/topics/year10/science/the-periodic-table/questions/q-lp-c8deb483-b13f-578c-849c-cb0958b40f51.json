    {"type":"mc","question":"Copper has configuration [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹ instead of [Ar] 3d⁹ 4s². Compare this with chromium's exception and identify the common principle.","correct":"Both achieve more stable arrangements: Cr gets a half-filled d⁵, Cu gets a fully-filled d¹⁰, both by taking an electron from 4s","correctExplanation":"Half-filled (d⁵) and fully-filled (d¹⁰) subshells have extra stability due to exchange energy. Both Cr and Cu sacrifice a 4s electron to achieve these configurations.","distractors":[{"answer":"Both exceptions are measurement errors","explanation":"Both are well-confirmed and explained by exchange energy stabilisation."},{"answer":"Copper and chromium follow the normal filling order","explanation":"Both deviate: Cr is [Ar]3d⁵4s¹ and Cu is [Ar]3d¹⁰4s¹ instead of the expected configurations."},{"answer":"The exceptions are random and follow no pattern","explanation":"Both follow the pattern of promoting a 4s electron to achieve half-filled or fully-filled d subshells."}]},

The {{blank:2}} subshell fills before 3d.","blanks":[{"id":1,"correct":"4s","correctExplanation":"4s is lower in energy than 3d, so it fills next after 3p.","distractors":[{"answer":"3d","explanation":"3d fills after 4s, not before it."},{"answer":"4p","explanation":"4p fills after 3d. The order is 4s, 3d, 4p."}]},{"id":2,"correct":"4s","correctExplanation":"The 4s subshell fills before the 3d subshell due to its lower energy.","distractors":[{"answer":"3d","explanation":"3d fills after 4s, not before."},{"answer":"4p","explanation":"4p fills after both 4s and 3d."}]}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about period lengths.","sentence":"Period lengths follow the pattern {{blank:1}}, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32, reflecting the electron {{blank:2}} that fill in each period.","blanks":[{"id":1,"correct":"2","correctExplanation":"Period 1 has 2 elements (1s²).","distractors":[{"answer":"8","explanation":"8 is Periods 2-3 length. Period 1 has 2 elements."},{"answer":"1","explanation":"Period 1 has 2 elements (hydrogen and helium)."}]},{"id":2,"correct":"subshells","correctExplanation":"Each period length corresponds to the subshells that fill: s, p, d, and f.","distractors":[{"answer":"shells","explanation":"While related to shells, the specific lengths come from which subshells fill."},{"answer":"protons","explanation":"Period lengths are determined by electron subshell capacities, not protons directly."}]}]}
