      "question": "Analyse why pure silicon has limited use in electronics compared to doped silicon.",
      "correctExplanation": "Pure (intrinsic) silicon has relatively few free charge carriers at room temperature. Adding dopant atoms (n-type or p-type) creates a controlled number of extra electrons or holes, giving precise control over conductivity.",

        "Pure silicon conducts too well and cannot be controlled",
        "Pure silicon is an insulator that cannot be modified",

      "question": "Compare the temperature dependence of resistance in metals versus semiconductors and explain the fundamental reason for the difference.",
      "correctExplanation": "In metals, increased temperature causes more atomic vibrations that scatter electrons, increasing resistance. In semiconductors, thermal energy frees more electrons from bonds, creating more charge carriers and reducing resistance.",

        "Both decrease resistance with temperature for the same reason",
        "Temperature has no effect on either material"

      "question": "Evaluate which material type would be most suitable for transmitting electrical power over long distances and justify your answer.",
      "correctExplanation": "Power loss in transmission is P = I²R. Conductors have the lowest resistance, minimising energy wasted as heat. Semiconductors would waste too much energy, and insulators wouldn't transmit at all.",
      "distractors": [
        "Semiconductor, because resistance can be controlled",

      "correctExplanation": "This describes a capacitor behaviour. While capacitors use insulators between plates, semiconductor devices like varactors can provide frequency-dependent properties. The key is that impedance must vary with frequency.",
      "distractors": [
        "A pure conductor that has zero resistance at all frequencies",

        "Diamond has more free electrons than graphite",

      "question": "Compare the behaviour of a thermistor (semiconductor) and a wire-wound resistor (metal conductor) as temperature sensors. Which provides better sensitivity and why?",
      "correctExplanation": "Semiconductor thermistors can change resistance by several percent per degree, while metal resistors change by only about 0.4% per degree. The exponential relationship in semiconductors provides much higher sensitivity.",
      "distractors": [
        "Wire-wound provides better sensitivity due to more free electrons",
        "Both have identical sensitivity to temperature",

      "question": "Superconductors have zero resistance below a critical temperature. Evaluate the implications if room-temperature superconductors became widely available.",
      "correctExplanation": "Zero resistance means no I²R losses in power transmission and no heating in circuits. However, superconductors expel magnetic fields (Meissner effect) and can carry enormous currents, requiring careful design.",
