      "what": "Current is the net flow of electric charge. In metals, electrons drift slowly (about 0.1 mm/s) toward the positive terminal. Conventional current is defined as flowing from positive to negative, opposite to electron flow.",
      "why": "The distinction matters because circuit analysis uses conventional current direction, even though we know electrons actually move the opposite way.",
