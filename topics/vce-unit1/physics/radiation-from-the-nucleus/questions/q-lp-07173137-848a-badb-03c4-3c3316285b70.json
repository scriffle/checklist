      "correct": "Isotope Y, because gamma radiation can be detected externally and the short half-life reduces patient dose",
      "correctExplanation": "Gamma radiation can exit the body for external imaging, and shorter half-life means the radioactivity decreases quickly after the scan.",
      "distractors": [

      "correct": "Inhaled radon delivers alpha radiation directly to sensitive lung tissue cells",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Radon gas chemically reacts with lung tissue to form carcinogenic compounds", "explanation": "While radon is chemically inert, the cancer risk comes from alpha radiation damaging lung cells, not chemical reactions." },

      "correct": "Alpha seeds deliver dose only millimetres from the implant, potentially sparing the spinal cord",
      "correctExplanation": "Alpha radiation's short range means dose is confined to the tumour volume, reducing risk to the nearby sensitive spinal cord.",
      "distractors": [

      "correctExplanation": "Alpha's high ionising ability destroys cells when inside the body, and standard radiation detection from outside fails because alpha cannot penetrate out.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Alpha radiation becomes millions of times more penetrating when dissolved in liquid", "explanation": "Alpha radiation properties don't change in solution; the danger comes from delivering dose to internal tissue." },
