      "question": "For archaeological dating of items 50,000 years old, Carbon-14 (half-life 5730 years) is suitable because approximately {{c1::8-9}} half-lives have elapsed, leaving detectable but reduced amounts.",
      "correct": "8-9",
      "correctExplanation": "After 50,000 years, about 8.7 half-lives have passed (50,000/5730), leaving roughly 0.2-0.4% of original C-14, which is still detectable but approaching the limit of the technique."

      "question": "When comparing radioisotopes for the same application, the one with the {{c1::shorter}} half-life generally results in less total radiation exposure, assuming both complete the task successfully.",
      "correct": "shorter",
      "correctExplanation": "A shorter half-life means the radioisotope decays more quickly after its purpose is fulfilled, reducing the cumulative radiation dose."

    {
      "type": "cloze",
      "question": "For industrial gauges measuring pipe thickness that must operate for decades, the ideal half-life should be {{c1::much longer}} than the equipment's operational lifetime.",
      "correct": "much longer",
      "correctExplanation": "If the half-life significantly exceeds the operational period, the radioisotope maintains relatively constant activity throughout, ensuring consistent measurements."

      "question": "A radioisotope with exactly the same half-life as the duration of its intended use would be optimal for all applications.",
      "correct": "False",
      "correctExplanation": "If the half-life equals the use duration, only 50% activity remains at the end. For reliable operation, the half-life should typically be longer than the required use period."
    },
    {
      "type": "tf",
      "question": "The choice of radioisotope for a given application often involves balancing the need for sufficient activity duration against the desire to minimise long-term radiation exposure.",
      "correct": "True",
      "correctExplanation": "This trade-off is fundamental to radioisotope selection: the isotope must remain active long enough to be useful while not persisting longer than necessary."
