      "correct": "The claim oversimplifies; advantages include bandwidth and interference immunity, not just speed",

      "question": "Compare single-mode and multi-mode optical fibres for a 100 km undersea cable. Which would be preferred and why?",
      "correct": "Single-mode, because it has less signal dispersion over long distances",
      "correctExplanation": "Multi-mode fibres suffer from modal dispersion as different paths have different lengths; single-mode eliminates this.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Multi-mode, because it can carry more data through multiple pathways", "explanation": "Multi-mode has more dispersion; single-mode is better for long distances despite fewer modes." },
        { "answer": "Either would work equally well at this distance with no difference", "explanation": "At 100 km, modal dispersion in multi-mode would significantly degrade signals." },

      "correctExplanation": "Radio waves have lower frequency (less energy than light) and cannot undergo TIR in glass optical fibres.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The proposal is correct because radio waves are used in wireless communication", "explanation": "Radio waves work differently; they don't undergo TIR in glass and have lower bandwidth." },

      "correctExplanation": "Lower loss per kilometer means signals can travel further before needing amplification, reducing infrastructure costs.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This proves optical fibres are unsuitable for any high-speed communication", "explanation": "Lower loss is an advantage; optical fibres are superior for high-speed, long-distance communication." },
