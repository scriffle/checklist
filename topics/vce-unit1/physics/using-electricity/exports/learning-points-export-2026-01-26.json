      "why": "LEDs are increasingly used for efficient lighting and indicator displays, making it important to understand their specific operating requirements.",

      "title": "I can explain how the earth connection provides safety",
      "code": "6C.5a",
      "what": "The earth wire connects metal casings to the ground (0V). If a fault causes the casing to become live, current flows to earth through the low-resistance wire, tripping the safety device.",
      "why": "Without earthing, a fault could leave a metal casing at 230V, electrocuting anyone who touches it.",
      "example": "If a loose wire touches a toaster's metal case, current flows through the earth wire (not through a person), causing the circuit breaker to trip.",

      "title": "I can explain when and why double insulation is used instead of earthing",
      "code": "6C.5b",
      "what": "Double-insulated appliances have two layers of insulation between live parts and the exterior, eliminating the need for an earth connection. They have only two-pin plugs.",
      "why": "Double insulation is used for portable appliances where an earth connection might be impractical or where the casing is entirely plastic.",
      "example": "A hairdryer has no exposed metal parts and uses double insulation. Both layers of insulation would need to fail before a shock hazard exists.",

      "title": "I can explain how a fuse works as a safety device",
      "code": "6C.6a",
      "what": "A fuse contains thin wire that melts and breaks the circuit when current exceeds its rating, protecting wiring and appliances from overheating due to faults or overloading.",
      "why": "Fuses prevent fires and equipment damage by disconnecting the supply before excessive current causes dangerous heating.",
      "example": "A 10A fuse wire melts if current exceeds 10A due to a short circuit, breaking the circuit before wiring overheats.",

      "title": "I can explain how a circuit breaker works as a safety device",
      "code": "6C.6b",
      "what": "A circuit breaker uses an electromagnetic switch that trips automatically when current exceeds its rating. Unlike fuses, circuit breakers can be reset after the fault is cleared.",
      "why": "Circuit breakers provide the same protection as fuses but are more convenient as they do not need replacement after tripping.",
      "example": "A 15A circuit breaker trips when current exceeds 15A. After fixing the fault, the breaker is reset by moving the switch from off to on.",

      "code": "6C.6c",
      "what": "An RCD compares current in active and neutral wires. If they differ (indicating current leaking to earth, possibly through a person), it trips within 30 milliseconds.",
      "why": "RCDs protect against electrocution by detecting very small leakage currents that would not trip ordinary circuit breakers.",
      "example": "If 30mA leaks to earth through a person, the RCD detects the imbalance between active and neutral currents and disconnects the supply in under 30ms.",
