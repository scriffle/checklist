      "question": "A student claims that a rheostat can never reduce current to zero. Analyse this claim.",
      "correctAnswer": "Correct - even maximum resistance allows some current to flow",
      "correctExplanation": "A rheostat has finite maximum resistance, so some current always flows. Only breaking the circuit stops current entirely.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Incorrect - moving the slider to the end stops all current", "explanation": "Even at maximum resistance, some current flows. Only a switch can stop current completely." },
        { "answer": "Incorrect - all rheostats include an off switch position", "explanation": "Rheostats provide variable resistance, not switching. Maximum R still allows some current." },
        { "answer": "Correct - but only at frequencies above 100 Hz", "explanation": "This is about DC resistance, not frequency. Any DC rheostat allows some current at max R." }
