      "question": "Why might a designer choose an LDR with a less steep characteristic curve for a particular application?",
      "correctAnswer": "Less sensitivity prevents false triggering from small light fluctuations",
      "correctExplanation": "Lower sensitivity means the circuit won't respond to minor light variations, improving stability.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Steeper curves are always better for all circuits", "explanation": "High sensitivity can cause false triggering. Less steep curves offer better stability." },
        { "answer": "Less steep curves cost significantly more money", "explanation": "Cost varies independently. Curve shape is chosen for application requirements." },
        { "answer": "The graph shape doesn't affect circuit performance", "explanation": "Curve shape directly affects sensitivity and stability in the circuit." }

        { "answer": "Temperature has no effect on LDR characteristics", "explanation": "Temperature does affect LDRs. Resistance can change with temperature variations." },

      "question": "A circuit designer finds their LDR measurements don't match the datasheet graph. What factors should they investigate?",
