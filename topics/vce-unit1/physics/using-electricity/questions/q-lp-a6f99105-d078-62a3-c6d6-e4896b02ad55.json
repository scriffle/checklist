      "correctAnswer": "Incorrect - LDR on top gives low output in bright light",
      "correctExplanation": "In bright light, top LDR has low resistance, so most voltage drops across the bottom resistor, giving low Vout.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Correct - lower LDR resistance means higher Vout", "explanation": "Lower LDR resistance (on top) means less voltage across it, so less Vout." },

      "correctAnswer": "Rapidly changing light causes the LDR to switch repeatedly",

        { "answer": "LDRs cannot detect natural sunlight properly", "explanation": "LDRs detect sunlight well. The issue is sensitivity to fluctuating light at transitions." },
