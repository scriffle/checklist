      "question": "A designer notices two NTC thermistors have similar resistance at 25°C but different graph slopes. What should they consider?",
      "correctAnswer": "The thermistors will behave differently at temperatures away from 25°C",
      "correctExplanation": "Different slopes mean different resistance changes with temperature, affecting circuit behaviour at other temperatures.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both thermistors will behave identically in any circuit", "explanation": "Different slopes mean different behaviour at temperatures other than 25°C." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Flat curves indicate the thermistor will break at cold temperatures", "explanation": "Flattening is normal behaviour, not damage. It indicates reduced sensitivity." },
