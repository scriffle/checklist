      "correctExplanation": "Ice melt: 2.6 × 10¹⁹ × 334 × 10³ ≈ 8.7 × 10²⁴ J. This is less than 10²⁴ J for ocean warming by comparison.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Melting all ice absorbs more energy overall", "explanation": "While ice melt is substantial, the calculation shows ocean warming is larger." },

      "correctExplanation": "Ice loss: 3000 km³ × 10⁹ m³ × 917 kg/m³ × 334 kJ/kg ≈ 10²¹ J, significant but oceans absorb 10²² J annually.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This energy would double atmospheric temperatures", "explanation": "The energy is substantial but atmosphere doesn't absorb it all directly." },
