      "question": "Analyze why the statement 'heat rises' is technically imprecise in physics.",
      "correct": "Hot air rises due to density differences, not heat itself rising independently",
      "correctExplanation": "Warm air is less dense and buoyant; heat transfers by convection through rising air, not as a rising entity.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The statement is completely accurate as heat is a rising substance", "explanation": "Heat is not a substance; hot air rises, carrying thermal energy with it." },
