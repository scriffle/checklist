      "question": "Compare the greenhouse effect on Earth versus Venus (surface ~735 K). How does the difference in emission wavelengths affect their climates?",
      "correct": "Venus emits at shorter wavelengths, but its dense atmosphere still traps infrared effectively",
      "correctExplanation": "Despite emitting at shorter wavelengths, Venus's thick CO₂ atmosphere absorbs across a wide infrared range.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Venus has no greenhouse effect because it emits visible light", "explanation": "Venus still emits infrared (peak ~4 μm) which is absorbed by CO₂." },
        { "answer": "Earth's greenhouse effect is stronger because it emits longer wavelengths", "explanation": "Venus has a much stronger greenhouse effect despite shorter emission wavelengths." },
        { "answer": "Emission wavelength has no relevance to either planet's climate", "explanation": "Emission wavelength determines which atmospheric gases can absorb the radiation." }

      "correct": "White roofs reflect visible light (solar input) but still emit infrared normally",
      "correctExplanation": "Reflection affects visible input; thermal emission at infrared wavelengths continues based on temperature.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "White roofs emit at shorter wavelengths, increasing cooling efficiency", "explanation": "Emission wavelength depends on temperature, not colour." },
        { "answer": "White roofs absorb more infrared, counteracting any cooling benefit", "explanation": "White surfaces primarily affect visible reflection; infrared behaviour is separate." },

      "correct": "Wien's law gives the peak; objects emit across a continuous spectrum",
      "correctExplanation": "Blackbody curves show emission at all wavelengths; Wien's law only identifies where the peak occurs.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Satellites are measuring reflected sunlight, not Earth's emission", "explanation": "Infrared satellites measure thermal emission, not reflected light." },

      "correctExplanation": "Without this window, all infrared would be absorbed, causing much stronger greenhouse warming.",
      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Stars are more challenging because they are much farther away", "explanation": "Distance affects intensity but Wien's law uses wavelength, which is preserved." },
