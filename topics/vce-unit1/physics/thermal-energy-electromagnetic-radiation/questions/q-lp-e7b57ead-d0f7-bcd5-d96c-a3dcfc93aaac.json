      "correct": "Incorrect reasoning; higher Lv is due to greater bond breaking needed",

        { "answer": "Correct reasoning; hotter substances always need more energy", "explanation": "Temperature affects energy for heating, but latent heat depends on bond breaking, not temperature." },

      "correct": "Water molecules have stronger intermolecular bonds than lead atoms",
      "correctExplanation": "Higher latent heat indicates more energy is needed to break the bonds, suggesting stronger intermolecular forces in ice.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Lead melts at a much lower temperature than ice does", "explanation": "Lead melts at 327°C, much higher than ice at 0°C; melting point doesn't determine latent heat." },
        { "answer": "Lead atoms are heavier so less energy per atom needed", "explanation": "Latent heat is per kilogram, already accounting for mass; the difference is in bond strength." },

      "correctExplanation": "When steam condenses on skin, it releases its latent heat of vaporisation (2,256 kJ/kg) in addition to the sensible heat.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Steam molecules move faster and strike skin with more force", "explanation": "Both are at 100°C, so molecular speeds are similar; the extra energy comes from condensation." },
        { "answer": "Steam penetrates deeper into skin tissue than water", "explanation": "The key factor is energy release during condensation, not penetration depth." },

      "correct": "Melting the ice at 0°C requires the most energy",
