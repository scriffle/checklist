      "code": "2A.1",
      "what": "Thermal energy is the total of all the random kinetic energies (movement) and potential energies (interactions between particles) of the atoms and molecules in an object or system.",
      "why": "This definition explains why objects with different masses at the same temperature contain different amounts of thermal energy, and why adding energy can increase temperature.",
      "example": "A cup of water at 80°C has less total thermal energy than a bathtub of water at 40°C, even though the cup is hotter. The bathtub has many more molecules, so the sum of all their energies is greater.",

      "what": "When thermal energy is added to a system, the temperature generally increases. When thermal energy is removed, the temperature generally decreases. Temperature indicates the average kinetic energy of particles.",
      "why": "This relationship helps predict which direction heat will flow between objects and explains why thermometers are useful for determining heat transfer direction.",
      "example": "Sparkler sparks at 1000°C landing on your skin do not burn you because they contain very few molecules and therefore very little total thermal energy, despite their high temperature.",

      "why": "The kelvin scale is required for many physics calculations, including Wien's law and gas laws, because it starts at absolute zero where particles have effectively no kinetic energy.",
      "example": "Room temperature of 20°C equals 293.15 K. The boiling point of water at 100°C equals 373.15 K. Absolute zero at 0 K equals -273.15°C.",

      "why": "Understanding absolute zero helps explain fundamental limits in physics and why the kelvin scale is used in scientific calculations involving energy and temperature ratios.",

      "what": "Conduction occurs when vibrating particles in a hotter region transfer energy to neighbouring particles through collisions and interactions. In metals, free electrons also carry energy. It is most significant in solids where particles are closely packed.",
      "why": "Understanding conduction explains why metals conduct heat well (free electrons), why insulation works, and why you can walk on hot coals without burning your feet (charcoal conducts poorly).",
      "example": "Copper has a thermal conductivity 8500 times greater than fibreglass. This is why saucepans have copper bases (good conduction) but insulated handles (poor conduction).",

      "code": "2A.4b",
      "what": "Convection transfers thermal energy through the physical movement of fluids (liquids and gases). Warmer fluid rises because it is less dense, while cooler fluid sinks, creating circulation patterns called convection currents.",
      "why": "Convection drives weather patterns, ocean currents, and heating systems. It explains phenomena like sea breezes during the day and land breezes at night.",
      "example": "During a sunny day, land heats faster than the ocean. Hot air rises over the land, drawing cooler air from over the ocean, creating a sea breeze. At night, the pattern reverses.",

      "what": "All objects above 0 K emit electromagnetic radiation. This radiation can travel through a vacuum (unlike conduction and convection) and is the only way thermal energy can transfer through empty space.",
      "why": "Radiation is how the Sun's energy reaches Earth across the vacuum of space. The wavelength of emitted radiation depends on temperature, which is why hot objects can glow red or white.",
      "example": "The Sun emits radiation that travels 150 million km through space to warm Earth. An outdoor radiant heater warms people without heating the air between the heater and the people.",

      "what": "In a liquid, molecules have a range of kinetic energies. The most energetic molecules near the surface can escape as gas, carrying away more than the average energy. This reduces the average kinetic energy of remaining molecules, cooling the liquid.",
      "why": "Evaporative cooling explains why sweating cools you down, why wet clothes feel cold, and how technologies like the Coolgardie safe and evaporative air conditioners work.",
      "example": "A Coolgardie safe keeps food cool by allowing water to evaporate from damp hessian covering. The most energetic water molecules escape, taking thermal energy with them and cooling the interior.",

      "code": "2A.4e",
      "what": "Conduction dominates in solids, convection dominates in fluids, radiation can occur through any medium including vacuum, and evaporation only occurs at liquid surfaces. Multiple mechanisms often operate simultaneously.",
      "why": "Identifying the dominant mechanism helps solve practical problems like designing insulation, understanding weather, or explaining why double-glazed windows reduce heat loss.",
      "example": "A vacuum flask reduces all transfer mechanisms: vacuum prevents conduction and convection, silvered surfaces reflect radiation, and a stopper prevents evaporation.",

      "why": "Specific heat capacity determines how much energy is needed to heat or cool a substance, explaining why water takes longer to heat than metal and why coastal areas have milder climates.",
      "example": "Water has a specific heat capacity of 4190 J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹, while copper has only 385 J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹. This means water requires about 11 times more energy per kg per degree than copper.",

      "what": "When a substance changes from gas to liquid (condensation) or liquid to solid (freezing), bonds form between molecules. This releases the same amount of energy that was required to break those bonds during the reverse process.",
      "why": "This explains why steam burns are particularly severe (steam releases latent heat of vaporisation when it condenses on skin), and why freezers must remove thermal energy from water to make ice.",
      "example": "Steam at 100°C condensing on your hand releases 2256 kJ per kg as it becomes water, causing worse burns than contact with boiling water at the same temperature.",
