      "correct": "The Arctic fish has more unsaturated fatty acids to maintain fluidity",
      "correctExplanation": "Unsaturated fatty acids prevent tight packing at cold temperatures, so cold-water organisms have a higher proportion of them.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The tropical fish has more unsaturated fatty acids than the Arctic fish", "explanation": "Tropical fish experience warmer temperatures and do not need as many unsaturated fatty acids to maintain fluidity." },

      "question": "Which evidence from a membrane diagram would best support the conclusion that a cell is adapted to a highly variable thermal environment?",

      "correct": "Lateral movement is frequent while flip-flop is rare",
      "correctExplanation": "Phospholipids readily move laterally within a leaflet but rarely flip between the inner and outer layers due to the energy required to move the hydrophilic head through the hydrophobic core.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both movements occur at equal rates within the bilayer", "explanation": "Flip-flop requires the polar head to pass through the hydrophobic core, making it much rarer than lateral movement." },

        { "answer": "It prevents all substances from crossing the membrane entirely", "explanation": "Channel proteins facilitate transport of specific substances; they do not block all movement." },
