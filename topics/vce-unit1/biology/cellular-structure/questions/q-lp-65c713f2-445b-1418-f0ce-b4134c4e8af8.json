The absence of visible internal structures may reflect the resolution or detail level of the diagram." },
        { "text": "The organelle must be a lysosome because lysosomes have variable internal appearance depending on their contents", "correct": false, "explanation": "Lysosomes are single-membrane vesicles, so a double membrane rules out a lysosome regardless of internal appearance." },
