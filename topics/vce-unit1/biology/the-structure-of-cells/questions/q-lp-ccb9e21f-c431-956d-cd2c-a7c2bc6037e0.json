Phospholipids need proteins for selective transport, proteins need the bilayer framework, cholesterol stabilises the whole structure, and carbohydrates work with proteins for recognition." },
        { "text": "This is correct because each component performs its function completely independently of all other components", "correct": false, "explanation": "Membrane components are interdependent. For example, transport proteins require the bilayer to function, and cholesterol regulates the fluidity of the phospholipid environment." },

Without cholesterol, the membrane becomes unstable but may function temporarily." },
