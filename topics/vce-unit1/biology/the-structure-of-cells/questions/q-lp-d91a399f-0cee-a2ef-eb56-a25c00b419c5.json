        { "text": "This is partially true because plant cells have additional structures, but complexity also depends on the functions performed", "correct": true, "explanation": "Plant cells do have additional structures (cell wall, chloroplasts, large vacuole), but animal cells have lysosomes and perform complex functions like phagocytosis. Complexity depends on more than just the number of organelle types." },
        { "text": "This is completely true because having more organelles always means greater cellular complexity", "correct": false, "explanation": "Complexity is not determined solely by organelle count. Animal cells perform complex functions like movement and phagocytosis that require flexibility." },
        { "text": "This is completely false because animal cells have more organelles than plant cells in every case", "correct": false, "explanation": "Plant cells do have more types of structures overall (cell wall, chloroplasts, large vacuole), though animal cells have lysosomes." },

        { "text": "There are no significant functional differences between plants and animals at the cellular level at all", "correct": false, "explanation": "There are major functional differences, including photosynthesis in plants and the flexibility of animal cells, which stem from structural differences." },

        { "text": "This is correct because chloroplasts produce all the energy a plant cell needs at all times of day", "correct": false, "explanation": "Chloroplasts produce glucose during photosynthesis, but cells need mitochondria to produce ATP, especially at night when photosynthesis cannot occur." },

Without these, the cell cannot produce the proteins needed for enzymes, membrane components, and other essential functions." },
        { "text": "The cell would function normally because rough ER and Golgi apparatus are not essential organelles", "correct": false, "explanation": "Rough ER and Golgi apparatus are essential for protein synthesis, modification, and transport, which are critical for cell function." },
        { "text": "The cell would only lose the ability to photosynthesise because the Golgi is needed for chloroplast function", "correct": false, "explanation": "The Golgi apparatus is not specifically needed for chloroplast function; its absence would affect protein processing throughout the entire cell." },

The combination of plant-specific structures supports this identification." },
