      "correct": "Multiple independent lines of evidence converging on the same conclusion strengthens the theory",
      "correctExplanation": "The strength of endosymbiotic theory lies in several different types of evidence all pointing to the same prokaryotic origin.",

      "correct": "Eukaryotic complexity arose through cooperation between simpler organisms",

      "question": "A critic argues that the presence of DNA in mitochondria does not prove endosymbiosis because organelles could have acquired DNA from the nucleus. How would you assess this counterargument?",
      "correct": "Mitochondrial DNA is circular and prokaryotic in character, unlike nuclear DNA",
      "correctExplanation": "The circular structure, gene organisation and sequence similarity to bacterial DNA all indicate an independent prokaryotic origin rather than nuclear transfer.",
