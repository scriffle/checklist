TITLE: I can use evidence from a diagram to explain the structure of the plasma membrane
CODE: 1B.5

WHAT (concept explanation):
This involves interpreting a diagram of the plasma membrane and using specific features shown in it to support an explanation. For example, explaining how you distinguish a glycoprotein from a glycolipid using visual evidence.

WHY (importance):
Explain questions require more than identification. You need to use the diagram as evidence and link structure to function with comparative language.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
To explain how saturated and unsaturated fatty acids affect fluidity: unsaturated tails have kinks caused by double bonds between carbon atoms, which prevent tight packing of phospholipids and increase the fluidity of the membrane.

SUBTOPIC: Plasma membrane
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the structure and function of the plasma membrane, including the phospholipid bilayer, proteins, carbohydrates and cholesterol. It also introduces the fluid mosaic model and the concepts of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: The plasma membrane controls what enters and leaves every cell, making it essential for cell survival. Understanding its structure helps you explain how different substances cross the membrane, which connects to transport processes covered later in the course.

TOPIC: Cellular structure
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 1
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Cells are the basic structural feature of life on Earth. This topic covers the distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the structure and function of the plasma membrane, and the specialisation of organelles for distinct functions.

Introduction
Cells are the basic structural feature of life on Earth. All cells have four features: genetic material,
plasma membrane, cytosol and ribosomes. Understanding the structural components of cells will
enable you to understand how different substances are processed within each cell. The plasma
membrane controls what enters or leaves the cell, and this function is vital in maintaining the
concentrations of reactants and products that enable the cell, and the organism, to function.
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes are the two main cell types, and being able to distinguish between
them is an important skill. Plants and animals are the two main groups of eukaryotic organisms.
Specialised structures within each cell are known as organelles, and in this chapter you will explore
the structure and function of each type of organelle.
The Interactive Textbook includes a worksheet, which discusses how to look at cells by using a
light microscope and how to represent cells using scientific drawings.

The largest living things
What is the biggest organism on Earth? Did you think of a blue whale? A blue whale
(Figure 1A–1) can grow to 30 metres long, and consists of about 100 quadrillion cells.
Compare this to an elephant’s 1000 trillion (or 1 quadrillion) cells, and a human’s
37.2 trillion cells.
In fact, none of these examples is the biggest organism on Earth. The biggest is a
fungus, Armillaria, commonly known as honey fungus (Figure 1A–2). The honey
fungus is known to stretch up to 3.8 km across the Blue Mountains in Oregon, in the
United States.

The examples given so far are multicellular
organisms. But what is the biggest
unicellular organism? An aquatic alga
called Caulerpa taxifolia (Figure 1A–3)
is unicellular, and can grow up to three
metres long.

EXPLAIN
An organism is defined as something that is living. But how do you know whether
something is living or not? In junior science, you learned the acronym MRSGREN
(movement, reproduction, sensitivity, growth, respiration, excretion, nutrition).
In VCE Biology, different criteria are used to distinguish between living and
non-living. The terms biotic (living) and abiotic (not living) are used.
An organism is made up of at least one cell. The cell is the basic unit of life, and
every cell comes from a pre-existing cell. This is known as cell theory.
The cells of plants, animals, bacteria and amoebas all have the following four
common factors (Figure 1A–4):
• genetic material
•
• cytosol
•
• ribosomes
•
• a plasma membrane.

1A SKILLS
Building a glossary
In studying Biology, you are required to remember, apply and explain many terms.
Before you start applying new terms, you need to understand them. A strategy to
achieve this is creating a glossary of your own, which will sharpen your skills
in defining terms.
To define is to state the precise nature or function of something. For example:
Question: Define ‘biotic’.
Answer: Living
You can elaborate on your response by explaining what ‘living’ means in a biological
setting.
Improved answer: ‘Biotic’ means living. A living thing consists of at least one cell,
which has a plasma membrane, genetic material, ribosomes and cytosol.
In both these instances, the define response does not go into detail with an example.
It simply explains what the term means, in the correct context.
Even if the answer is a single word, it can require you to use your understanding, as
shown in this example:
Question: Provide an example of a biotic factor essential for the survival of a
blue whale.
Answer: Krill
This answer requires an understanding of what ‘biotic’ means, and that the term does
not include other things that are also essential for survival, such as oxygen, which is an
abiotic factor.
To start creating your own glossary, you can use the highlighted glossary terms in
this textbook or download the online document, which has a list of key terms for
each chapter.

Separating internal and external
The plasma membrane (also known as the cell membrane) acts as a boundary between
the internal environment of a cell and its external environment. Figures 1B–1 and
1B–2 illustrate how the plasma membrane helps to determine the two different
environments. Without a plasma membrane a cell would not exist, because the
survival of the cell depends on how substances are exchanged between the internal
and external environments. Remember that a plasma membrane is one of four
common features of all cell types.

EXPLAIN
Structure and function of the plasma membrane
The structure of the plasma membrane relates to its function and the type
of cell it is in. The plasma membrane is a semi-permeable membrane that
allows substances to be transported between the internal and external
environments of the cell (Figure 1B–3). It consists of a phospholipid bilayer,
proteins, carbohydrates and cholesterol.
The functions of the plasma membrane include but are not limited to:
• recognising other cells when forming tissue, or determining whether cells are foreign
•
during an immune response
• communicating with other cells
•
• selectively controlling which substances are transported into or out of the cell.
•
The process of transporting substances across the plasma membrane is explored in detail in
Chapter 2.

LINK
The phospholipid bilayer is arranged with the hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails facing
inwards and the hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads on the outsides of the membrane,
towards the watery internal and external environments. Because the plasma membrane
is made up of phospholipids, it is able to selectively allow different substances to enter
and leave the cell. Water-soluble (hydrophilic) substances need the assistance of a protein
channel to cross the phospholipid part of the membrane. Lipid-soluble (hydrophobic)
substances are able to cross through the phospholipids of the plasma membrane.

2 List the key components of a plasma membrane.
3 Which part of the plasma membrane is hydrophilic?
Fluid mosaic model
A plasma membrane is made up of different types (a mosaic) of molecules. It is also fluid –
that is, the phospholipids and proteins are able to move around within each layer. Referring
to plasma membranes in this way is known as the fluid mosaic model (see Figure 1B–4 on the
previous page).
Recall that a phospholipid consists of a head and two tails, and the tails consist of fatty
acids. If these fatty acids only have single bonds between the carbon atoms (i.e. they are
‘saturated’), then they can pack together tightly. If the fatty acids have some double bonds
between carbon atoms (‘unsaturated’), then they pack together less tightly. If there are
unsaturated fatty acids in the tails, they have some double bonds between carbon atoms and
this makes them pack together less tightly. So more unsaturated fatty acids in the tails of
the phospholipids increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane (Figure 1B–5).

The difference between ‘identify’ and ‘explain’
The ability to identify the components of a plasma
membrane is a key skill. It is important that you
become familiar with a variety of representations
of the plasma membrane, as different diagrams can
be used during an assessment.
Figure 1B–6 is a representation of a plasma
membrane. If the question asks you to identify
some or all of the components, be succinct and
specific. If the question asks you to explain, this is
the time to elaborate on your answer.

12 CHAPTER 1 CELLULAR STRUCTURE
For example:
Question: Identify components A and E from the diagram of the plasma membrane
(Figure 1B–6).
Answer: A = phospholipid, E = cholesterol
This sample response has done exactly what the question required, without elaboration.
Question: Explain how you know whether a component of a plasma membrane is a
glycoprotein or a glycolipid.
Answer: A glycoprotein consists of a carbohydrate chain attached to a protein
molecule, as indicated by C in the diagram. A glycolipid, by comparison, consists of a
carbohydrate chain attached to a phospholipid, as indicated by B in the diagram.
This answer gives an elaborated response that demonstrates the ability to differentiate
between the two components of the plasma membrane. To ensure that the answer is
clear, a comparative term is included (‘by comparison’). The answer also incorporates
specific evidence from the diagram to further demonstrate the correct understanding of
the difference between the two components of the plasma membrane.

QUESTIONS
Using diagrams to answer questions
When providing examples of organisms that are either eukaryotic or prokaryotic, it is
important to use cellular features as your justification. A key cellular feature is the
presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles. If the cell contains a membrane-
bound organelle, then it is a eukaryote.
One type of organism that often causes confusion is protists. A protist is unicellular
but it is not a prokaryote. It is important to remember that some unicellular
organisms, such as paramecium, contain membrane-bound organelles, as shown in
Figure 1C–6. For this reason, a paramecium is classified as a eukaryote.

Figure 1C–6 A paramecium is a unicellular organism that
has membrane-bound organelles.
You could be asked to identify which of the examples are either a prokaryote or
a eukaryote. When a question asks you to identify, there is no need to include a
justification or explanation. All you need to do is put the example into a category, or
label it as either prokaryote or eukaryote.

For example:
Question: Identify which of the diagrams shows a prokaryote.
Mitochondrion
A C
B Flagellum
Eyespot
Nucleus
Contractile
vacuole
Chloroplasts
Golgi
apparatus
Answer: C
As you can see, the answer consists of just the letter associated with the correct diagram.
This is in contrast to a question that asks you to justify your choice. For example:
Question: Provide a justification for why you have identified your answer as a
prokaryote.
Answer: C lacks membrane-bound organelles. The other two diagrams show a
nucleus or another membrane-bound organelle. Hence C is a prokaryote.
Note that the answer does not repeat the question, and it gives a specific piece of
evidence as the reason for the choice. The response also finishes by coming back to the
context of the question, re-stating that the chosen option is a prokaryote.

Symbiosis and endosymbiosis
Why does a mitochondrion have a double membrane, its own ribosomes and its own set
of DNA? Mitochondria are believed to have arisen as a result of one prokaryote engulfing
another, aerobic, prokaryote. An aerobic prokaryote is able to use oxygen to respire. The
first prokaryote – the one doing the engulfing – was then able to take on the respiratory
function of the aerobic prokaryote that it engulfed. The first prokaryote did not break
down the aerobic prokaryote; instead, it retained it and gained its aerobic function. This
kind of beneficial relationship between two organisms is called symbiosis, and if one of the
organisms lives inside the other it is referred to as endosymbiosis.
EXPLAIN
Benefits of compartmentalisation within cells
A cell can be thought of as a ‘reaction factory’, a place where many molecules (reactants)
interact to release new products. For a successful reaction, the molecules need to move into
and around the cell at the correct rate. They also need to be in the correct concentration for
specific chemical reactions to occur.
A eukaryotic cell is relatively large, making it more difficult for chemical reactions to occur
efficiently within it. This problem is overcome by having smaller compartments within the
cell. Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within a cell that perform specific
functions. Each individual organelle (except ribosomes) has a plasma membrane. This
membrane enables the organelle to maintain the concentrations of molecules at levels that
allow the reactants to interact with each other at optimal rates. The compartmentalisation
within organelles also allows various chemical reactions to occur simultaneously in different
places without interfering with each other (Figure 1D–1).
Reactant molecules
spread out in a large
compartment.
If the reactant molecules are
restricted to a smaller space by
being enclosed in an organelle,
they are more likely to bump
into each other and react.
More organelles allow other
specialised reactions to
take place without being
affected by the presence
of other reactants.

Figure 1D–2 Generalised animal cell and plant cell, with organelles labelled
It is important to realise that cells do not all have the same types and numbers of organelles.
The types and numbers of organelles present in a cell are specific to the type of tissue in
which the cell is found. For example, a sperm cell requires a lot of energy, so you would
expect to find a large number of mitochondria in it, as mitochondria provide energy for the
cell. The secretory cells that line the stomach are part of the digestive system, and hence
they require a lot of Golgi apparatus to enable them to release enzymes (proteins) that aid
in the breakdown of food molecules.

Comparison of plant and animal cells
Plant cells and animal cells have many organelles in common, but there are some
differences (Figure 1D–4).
A misconception is that plant cells only perform photosynthesis and do not respire. In fact,
plant cells perform both photosynthesis and aerobic cellular respiration, and so a plant
cell has both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Not all the cells in a plant photosynthesise
(e.g. root cells do not photosynthesise), but they do all respire. In contrast, animal cells do
not have any chloroplasts, and do not photosynthesise.
Two further key differences between plant cells and animal cells:
• Cell wall – plant cells have a cell wall to aid with structural support for the whole plant,
•
whereas animal cells do not. Animals have other features, such as an exoskeleton or
bones, to provide support.
• Permanent vacuole – plant cells have a permanent large vacuole for the storage of
•
water, minerals and ions. The vacuole also assists with the structural support of the
cell through turgor pressure (pressure exerted by water). Animal cells do have vacuoles
but they are small and are not permanently present, and they do not provide structural
support to the cell.

1D SKILLS
Understanding processes through linked steps
A way to remember the function of different organelles is to include them in a series of
linked steps that form a process. For example, you can use steps to describe the process
of protein synthesis. You will meet this process in detail in Unit 3. Using steps in this way
will enable you to deepen your understanding and boost your ability to remember the key
organelles and their functions.

Figure 1D–5 Outline of protein synthesis
The process of protein synthesis is outlined in diagrammatic form in Figure 1D–5. The
steps in this process are as follows:
1 Conversion of DNA to RNA
• Within the nucleus, which contains the genetic material, the DNA is transcribed
•
to build RNA, which leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore.
2 Conversion of RNA to protein (translation)
• RNA is translated at a ribosome, which synthesises the corresponding protein. If the
•
protein is destined for the outside of the cell or the plasma membrane, the ribosome
is attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
3 Transportation of protein
• The rough endoplasmic reticulum transports the protein in a vesicle to the Golgi
•
apparatus.
4 Packaging of protein
• The Golgi apparatus modifies and packages the protein into a vesicle, ready for
•
exporting out of the cell.
5 Secretion of protein (exocytosis)
• The protein is released to the extracellular environment of the cell.
•
Creating flashcards
A further strategy to help you remember the functions of the organelles is to use the
diagrams and definitions from Table 1D–1 to create flip cards (flashcards). The more
you use images associated with terms and definitions, the easier it will be for you to
correctly recall the organelle functions.

ANSWERING
COMPARATIVE
QUESTIONS
Answering comparative questions
Answering comparison-based questions is a vital skill. Here is an example of how to
approach a comparative question in relation to animal and plant cells:
Question: What are two differences between the structure of a plant cell and the
structure of an animal cell?
Answer: A plant cell contains chloroplasts to perform photosynthesis, whereas
animal cells do not have chloroplasts. Also, a plant cell has a cell wall that surrounds
the plasma membrane, while an animal cell only has a plasma membrane as the
outermost layer of the cell.
Key points to remember when answering comparative questions:
• Make it clear that there is a comparison, by using terms such as ‘whereas’, ‘although’,
•
‘in contrast’, and ‘unlike’.
• If the question asks for a set number of comparisons, discuss one item in each
•
comparison. For example:
A plant cell has chloroplasts, whereas an animal cell does not.
A plant cell has a cell wall, but an animal cell does not.
▶ Avoid comparing multiple items at the same time, because if one item is wrong, it
▶
will make the whole comparison wrong. It can also mean that you run out of items
to compare.
• Keep your comparisons succinct and do not repeat the question.
•
In the example above, you would not begin your answer like this: ‘A difference
between a plant cell and an animal cell is that …’. If you find that you tend to do this,
try starting your answer after ‘that’ and go from there. You could also use dot points
when answering questions.
• Within your comparison, be sure to incorporate the content that you are most
•
confident with, to increase your likelihood of gaining full marks.

cells have chloroplasts (left).

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can use evidence from a diagram to explain the structure of the plasma membrane
CODE: 1B.5

WHAT (concept explanation):
This involves interpreting a diagram of the plasma membrane and using specific features shown in it to support an explanation. For example, explaining how you distinguish a glycoprotein from a glycolipid using visual evidence.

WHY (importance):
Explain questions require more than identification. You need to use the diagram as evidence and link structure to function with comparative language.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
To explain how saturated and unsaturated fatty acids affect fluidity: unsaturated tails have kinks caused by double bonds between carbon atoms, which prevent tight packing of phospholipids and increase the fluidity of the membrane.

SUBTOPIC: Plasma membrane
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the structure and function of the plasma membrane, including the phospholipid bilayer, proteins, carbohydrates and cholesterol. It also introduces the fluid mosaic model and the concepts of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: The plasma membrane controls what enters and leaves every cell, making it essential for cell survival. Understanding its structure helps you explain how different substances cross the membrane, which connects to transport processes covered later in the course.

TOPIC: Cellular structure
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 1
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Cells are the basic structural feature of life on Earth. This topic covers the distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the structure and function of the plasma membrane, and the specialisation of organelles for distinct functions.

Introduction
Cells are the basic structural feature of life on Earth. All cells have four features: genetic material,
plasma membrane, cytosol and ribosomes. Understanding the structural components of cells will
enable you to understand how different substances are processed within each cell. The plasma
membrane controls what enters or leaves the cell, and this function is vital in maintaining the
concentrations of reactants and products that enable the cell, and the organism, to function.
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes are the two main cell types, and being able to distinguish between
them is an important skill. Plants and animals are the two main groups of eukaryotic organisms.
Specialised structures within each cell are known as organelles, and in this chapter you will explore
the structure and function of each type of organelle.
The Interactive Textbook includes a worksheet, which discusses how to look at cells by using a
light microscope and how to represent cells using scientific drawings.

The largest living things
What is the biggest organism on Earth? Did you think of a blue whale? A blue whale
(Figure 1A–1) can grow to 30 metres long, and consists of about 100 quadrillion cells.
Compare this to an elephant’s 1000 trillion (or 1 quadrillion) cells, and a human’s
37.2 trillion cells.
In fact, none of these examples is the biggest organism on Earth. The biggest is a
fungus, Armillaria, commonly known as honey fungus (Figure 1A–2). The honey
fungus is known to stretch up to 3.8 km across the Blue Mountains in Oregon, in the
United States.

unicellular organism? An aquatic alga
called Caulerpa taxifolia (Figure 1A–3)
is unicellular, and can grow up to three
metres long.

EXPLAIN
An organism is defined as something that is living. But how do you know whether
something is living or not? In junior science, you learned the acronym MRSGREN
(movement, reproduction, sensitivity, growth, respiration, excretion, nutrition).
In VCE Biology, different criteria are used to distinguish between living and
non-living. The terms biotic (living) and abiotic (not living) are used.
An organism is made up of at least one cell. The cell is the basic unit of life, and
every cell comes from a pre-existing cell. This is known as cell theory.
The cells of plants, animals, bacteria and amoebas all have the following four
common factors (Figure 1A–4):
• genetic material
•
• cytosol
•
• ribosomes
•
• a plasma membrane.

1A SKILLS
Building a glossary
In studying Biology, you are required to remember, apply and explain many terms.
Before you start applying new terms, you need to understand them. A strategy to
achieve this is creating a glossary of your own, which will sharpen your skills
in defining terms.
To define is to state the precise nature or function of something. For example:
Question: Define ‘biotic’.
Answer: Living
You can elaborate on your response by explaining what ‘living’ means in a biological
setting.
Improved answer: ‘Biotic’ means living. A living thing consists of at least one cell,
which has a plasma membrane, genetic material, ribosomes and cytosol.
In both these instances, the define response does not go into detail with an example.
It simply explains what the term means, in the correct context.
Even if the answer is a single word, it can require you to use your understanding, as
shown in this example:
Question: Provide an example of a biotic factor essential for the survival of a
blue whale.
Answer: Krill
This answer requires an understanding of what ‘biotic’ means, and that the term does
not include other things that are also essential for survival, such as oxygen, which is an
abiotic factor.
To start creating your own glossary, you can use the highlighted glossary terms in
this textbook or download the online document, which has a list of key terms for
each chapter.

Separating internal and external
The plasma membrane (also known as the cell membrane) acts as a boundary between
the internal environment of a cell and its external environment. Figures 1B–1 and
1B–2 illustrate how the plasma membrane helps to determine the two different
environments. Without a plasma membrane a cell would not exist, because the
survival of the cell depends on how substances are exchanged between the internal
and external environments. Remember that a plasma membrane is one of four

EXPLAIN
Structure and function of the plasma membrane
The structure of the plasma membrane relates to its function and the type
of cell it is in. The plasma membrane is a semi-permeable membrane that
allows substances to be transported between the internal and external
environments of the cell (Figure 1B–3). It consists of a phospholipid bilayer,
proteins, carbohydrates and cholesterol.
The functions of the plasma membrane include but are not limited to:
• recognising other cells when forming tissue, or determining whether cells are foreign
•
during an immune response
• communicating with other cells
•
• selectively controlling which substances are transported into or out of the cell.
•
The process of transporting substances across the plasma membrane is explored in detail in
Chapter 2.

LINK
The phospholipid bilayer is arranged with the hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails facing
inwards and the hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads on the outsides of the membrane,
towards the watery internal and external environments. Because the plasma membrane
is made up of phospholipids, it is able to selectively allow different substances to enter
and leave the cell. Water-soluble (hydrophilic) substances need the assistance of a protein
channel to cross the phospholipid part of the membrane. Lipid-soluble (hydrophobic)
substances are able to cross through the phospholipids of the plasma membrane.

2 List the key components of a plasma membrane.
3 Which part of the plasma membrane is hydrophilic?
Fluid mosaic model
A plasma membrane is made up of different types (a mosaic) of molecules. It is also fluid –
that is, the phospholipids and proteins are able to move around within each layer. Referring
to plasma membranes in this way is known as the fluid mosaic model (see Figure 1B–4 on the
previous page).
Recall that a phospholipid consists of a head and two tails, and the tails consist of fatty
acids. If these fatty acids only have single bonds between the carbon atoms (i.e. they are
‘saturated’), then they can pack together tightly. If the fatty acids have some double bonds
between carbon atoms (‘unsaturated’), then they pack together less tightly. If there are
unsaturated fatty acids in the tails, they have some double bonds between carbon atoms and
this makes them pack together less tightly. So more unsaturated fatty acids in the tails of
the phospholipids increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane (Figure 1B–5).

The difference between ‘identify’ and ‘explain’
The ability to identify the components of a plasma
membrane is a key skill. It is important that you
become familiar with a variety of representations
of the plasma membrane, as different diagrams can
be used during an assessment.
Figure 1B–6 is a representation of a plasma
membrane. If the question asks you to identify
some or all of the components, be succinct and
specific. If the question asks you to explain, this is
the time to elaborate on your answer.

glycoprotein or a glycolipid.
Answer: A glycoprotein consists of a carbohydrate chain attached to a protein
molecule, as indicated by C in the diagram. A glycolipid, by comparison, consists of a
carbohydrate chain attached to a phospholipid, as indicated by B in the diagram.
This answer gives an elaborated response that demonstrates the ability to differentiate
between the two components of the plasma membrane. To ensure that the answer is
clear, a comparative term is included (‘by comparison’). The answer also incorporates
specific evidence from the diagram to further demonstrate the correct understanding of
the difference between the two components of the plasma membrane.

Prokaryotes and eukaryotes
Organisms can be classified into one of two groups: prokaryotes and eukaryotes (see

Prokaryotic cells do not contain membrane-bound organelles. Examples of prokaryotic
organisms are bacteria and archaea.
Eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular organisms, and are made up of eukaryotic
cells. Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles. Examples of eukaryotic
organisms are protists, fungi, plants and animals.

QUESTIONS
Using diagrams to answer questions
When providing examples of organisms that are either eukaryotic or prokaryotic, it is
important to use cellular features as your justification. A key cellular feature is the
presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles. If the cell contains a membrane-
bound organelle, then it is a eukaryote.
One type of organism that often causes confusion is protists. A protist is unicellular
but it is not a prokaryote. It is important to remember that some unicellular
organisms, such as paramecium, contain membrane-bound organelles, as shown in
Figure 1C–6. For this reason, a paramecium is classified as a eukaryote.

You could be asked to identify which of the examples are either a prokaryote or
a eukaryote. When a question asks you to identify, there is no need to include a
justification or explanation. All you need to do is put the example into a category, or
label it as either prokaryote or eukaryote.

Answer: C
As you can see, the answer consists of just the letter associated with the correct diagram.
This is in contrast to a question that asks you to justify your choice. For example:
Question: Provide a justification for why you have identified your answer as a
prokaryote.
Answer: C lacks membrane-bound organelles. The other two diagrams show a
nucleus or another membrane-bound organelle. Hence C is a prokaryote.
Note that the answer does not repeat the question, and it gives a specific piece of
evidence as the reason for the choice. The response also finishes by coming back to the
context of the question, re-stating that the chosen option is a prokaryote.

Symbiosis and endosymbiosis
Why does a mitochondrion have a double membrane, its own ribosomes and its own set
of DNA? Mitochondria are believed to have arisen as a result of one prokaryote engulfing
another, aerobic, prokaryote. An aerobic prokaryote is able to use oxygen to respire. The
first prokaryote – the one doing the engulfing – was then able to take on the respiratory
function of the aerobic prokaryote that it engulfed. The first prokaryote did not break
down the aerobic prokaryote; instead, it retained it and gained its aerobic function. This
kind of beneficial relationship between two organisms is called symbiosis, and if one of the
organisms lives inside the other it is referred to as endosymbiosis.
EXPLAIN
Benefits of compartmentalisation within cells
A cell can be thought of as a ‘reaction factory’, a place where many molecules (reactants)
interact to release new products. For a successful reaction, the molecules need to move into
and around the cell at the correct rate. They also need to be in the correct concentration for
specific chemical reactions to occur.
A eukaryotic cell is relatively large, making it more difficult for chemical reactions to occur
efficiently within it. This problem is overcome by having smaller compartments within the
cell. Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within a cell that perform specific
functions. Each individual organelle (except ribosomes) has a plasma membrane. This
membrane enables the organelle to maintain the concentrations of molecules at levels that
allow the reactants to interact with each other at optimal rates. The compartmentalisation
within organelles also allows various chemical reactions to occur simultaneously in different
places without interfering with each other (Figure 1D–1).
Reactant molecules
spread out in a large
compartment.
If the reactant molecules are
restricted to a smaller space by
being enclosed in an organelle,
they are more likely to bump
into each other and react.
More organelles allow other
specialised reactions to
take place without being
affected by the presence
of other reactants.

It is important to realise that cells do not all have the same types and numbers of organelles.
The types and numbers of organelles present in a cell are specific to the type of tissue in
which the cell is found. For example, a sperm cell requires a lot of energy, so you would
expect to find a large number of mitochondria in it, as mitochondria provide energy for the
cell. The secretory cells that line the stomach are part of the digestive system, and hence
they require a lot of Golgi apparatus to enable them to release enzymes (proteins) that aid
in the breakdown of food molecules.

Comparison of plant and animal cells
Plant cells and animal cells have many organelles in common, but there are some
differences (Figure 1D–4).
A misconception is that plant cells only perform photosynthesis and do not respire. In fact,
plant cells perform both photosynthesis and aerobic cellular respiration, and so a plant
cell has both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Not all the cells in a plant photosynthesise
(e.g. root cells do not photosynthesise), but they do all respire. In contrast, animal cells do
not have any chloroplasts, and do not photosynthesise.
Two further key differences between plant cells and animal cells:
• Cell wall – plant cells have a cell wall to aid with structural support for the whole plant,
•
whereas animal cells do not. Animals have other features, such as an exoskeleton or
bones, to provide support.
• Permanent vacuole – plant cells have a permanent large vacuole for the storage of
•
water, minerals and ions. The vacuole also assists with the structural support of the
cell through turgor pressure (pressure exerted by water). Animal cells do have vacuoles
but they are small and are not permanently present, and they do not provide structural
support to the cell.

Understanding processes through linked steps
A way to remember the function of different organelles is to include them in a series of
linked steps that form a process. For example, you can use steps to describe the process
of protein synthesis. You will meet this process in detail in Unit 3. Using steps in this way
will enable you to deepen your understanding and boost your ability to remember the key
organelles and their functions.

Figure 1D–5 Outline of protein synthesis
The process of protein synthesis is outlined in diagrammatic form in Figure 1D–5. The
steps in this process are as follows:
1 Conversion of DNA to RNA
• Within the nucleus, which contains the genetic material, the DNA is transcribed
•
to build RNA, which leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore.
2 Conversion of RNA to protein (translation)
• RNA is translated at a ribosome, which synthesises the corresponding protein. If the
•
protein is destined for the outside of the cell or the plasma membrane, the ribosome
is attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
3 Transportation of protein
• The rough endoplasmic reticulum transports the protein in a vesicle to the Golgi
•
apparatus.
4 Packaging of protein
• The Golgi apparatus modifies and packages the protein into a vesicle, ready for
•
exporting out of the cell.
5 Secretion of protein (exocytosis)
• The protein is released to the extracellular environment of the cell.
•
Creating flashcards
A further strategy to help you remember the functions of the organelles is to use the
diagrams and definitions from Table 1D–1 to create flip cards (flashcards). The more
you use images associated with terms and definitions, the easier it will be for you to
correctly recall the organelle functions.

ANSWERING
COMPARATIVE
QUESTIONS
Answering comparative questions
Answering comparison-based questions is a vital skill. Here is an example of how to
approach a comparative question in relation to animal and plant cells:
Question: What are two differences between the structure of a plant cell and the
structure of an animal cell?
Answer: A plant cell contains chloroplasts to perform photosynthesis, whereas
animal cells do not have chloroplasts. Also, a plant cell has a cell wall that surrounds
the plasma membrane, while an animal cell only has a plasma membrane as the
outermost layer of the cell.
Key points to remember when answering comparative questions:
• Make it clear that there is a comparison, by using terms such as ‘whereas’, ‘although’,
•
‘in contrast’, and ‘unlike’.
• If the question asks for a set number of comparisons, discuss one item in each
•
comparison. For example:
A plant cell has chloroplasts, whereas an animal cell does not.
A plant cell has a cell wall, but an animal cell does not.
▶ Avoid comparing multiple items at the same time, because if one item is wrong, it
▶
will make the whole comparison wrong. It can also mean that you run out of items
to compare.
• Keep your comparisons succinct and do not repeat the question.
•
In the example above, you would not begin your answer like this: ‘A difference
between a plant cell and an animal cell is that …’. If you find that you tend to do this,
try starting your answer after ‘that’ and go from there. You could also use dot points
when answering questions.
• Within your comparison, be sure to incorporate the content that you are most
•
confident with, to increase your likelihood of gaining full marks.

TARGET: Demonstrate comprehension of concepts.
TEST: Can student explain ideas in their own words or recognise examples?
QUESTION TYPES: Explain concepts, interpret meanings, classify examples, summarise relationships.
STEMS: "Which statement best explains...", "What does X mean...", "An example of X would be...", "Why does..."
AVOID: Direct recall of definitions. Require paraphrasing or recognition in new contexts.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can use evidence from a diagram to explain the structure of the plasma membrane
CODE: 1B.5

WHAT (concept explanation):
This involves interpreting a diagram of the plasma membrane and using specific features shown in it to support an explanation. For example, explaining how you distinguish a glycoprotein from a glycolipid using visual evidence.

WHY (importance):
Explain questions require more than identification. You need to use the diagram as evidence and link structure to function with comparative language.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
To explain how saturated and unsaturated fatty acids affect fluidity: unsaturated tails have kinks caused by double bonds between carbon atoms, which prevent tight packing of phospholipids and increase the fluidity of the membrane.

SUBTOPIC: Plasma membrane
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the structure and function of the plasma membrane, including the phospholipid bilayer, proteins, carbohydrates and cholesterol. It also introduces the fluid mosaic model and the concepts of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: The plasma membrane controls what enters and leaves every cell, making it essential for cell survival. Understanding its structure helps you explain how different substances cross the membrane, which connects to transport processes covered later in the course.

TOPIC: Cellular structure
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 1
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Cells are the basic structural feature of life on Earth. This topic covers the distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the structure and function of the plasma membrane, and the specialisation of organelles for distinct functions.

Introduction
Cells are the basic structural feature of life on Earth. All cells have four features: genetic material,
plasma membrane, cytosol and ribosomes. Understanding the structural components of cells will
enable you to understand how different substances are processed within each cell. The plasma
membrane controls what enters or leaves the cell, and this function is vital in maintaining the
concentrations of reactants and products that enable the cell, and the organism, to function.
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes are the two main cell types, and being able to distinguish between
them is an important skill. Plants and animals are the two main groups of eukaryotic organisms.
Specialised structures within each cell are known as organelles, and in this chapter you will explore
the structure and function of each type of organelle.
The Interactive Textbook includes a worksheet, which discusses how to look at cells by using a
light microscope and how to represent cells using scientific drawings.

The largest living things
What is the biggest organism on Earth? Did you think of a blue whale? A blue whale
(Figure 1A–1) can grow to 30 metres long, and consists of about 100 quadrillion cells.
Compare this to an elephant’s 1000 trillion (or 1 quadrillion) cells, and a human’s
37.2 trillion cells.
In fact, none of these examples is the biggest organism on Earth. The biggest is a
fungus, Armillaria, commonly known as honey fungus (Figure 1A–2). The honey
fungus is known to stretch up to 3.8 km across the Blue Mountains in Oregon, in the
United States.

The examples given so far are multicellular
organisms. But what is the biggest
unicellular organism? An aquatic alga
called Caulerpa taxifolia (Figure 1A–3)
is unicellular, and can grow up to three
metres long.

EXPLAIN
An organism is defined as something that is living. But how do you know whether
something is living or not? In junior science, you learned the acronym MRSGREN
(movement, reproduction, sensitivity, growth, respiration, excretion, nutrition).
In VCE Biology, different criteria are used to distinguish between living and
non-living. The terms biotic (living) and abiotic (not living) are used.
An organism is made up of at least one cell. The cell is the basic unit of life, and
every cell comes from a pre-existing cell. This is known as cell theory.
The cells of plants, animals, bacteria and amoebas all have the following four
common factors (Figure 1A–4):
• genetic material
•
• cytosol
•
• ribosomes
•
• a plasma membrane.

1A SKILLS
Building a glossary
In studying Biology, you are required to remember, apply and explain many terms.
Before you start applying new terms, you need to understand them. A strategy to
achieve this is creating a glossary of your own, which will sharpen your skills
in defining terms.
To define is to state the precise nature or function of something. For example:
Question: Define ‘biotic’.
Answer: Living
You can elaborate on your response by explaining what ‘living’ means in a biological
setting.
Improved answer: ‘Biotic’ means living. A living thing consists of at least one cell,
which has a plasma membrane, genetic material, ribosomes and cytosol.
In both these instances, the define response does not go into detail with an example.
It simply explains what the term means, in the correct context.
Even if the answer is a single word, it can require you to use your understanding, as
shown in this example:
Question: Provide an example of a biotic factor essential for the survival of a
blue whale.
Answer: Krill
This answer requires an understanding of what ‘biotic’ means, and that the term does
not include other things that are also essential for survival, such as oxygen, which is an
abiotic factor.
To start creating your own glossary, you can use the highlighted glossary terms in
this textbook or download the online document, which has a list of key terms for
each chapter.

Separating internal and external
The plasma membrane (also known as the cell membrane) acts as a boundary between
the internal environment of a cell and its external environment. Figures 1B–1 and
1B–2 illustrate how the plasma membrane helps to determine the two different
environments. Without a plasma membrane a cell would not exist, because the
survival of the cell depends on how substances are exchanged between the internal
and external environments. Remember that a plasma membrane is one of four
common features of all cell types.

Structure and function of the plasma membrane
The structure of the plasma membrane relates to its function and the type
of cell it is in. The plasma membrane is a semi-permeable membrane that
allows substances to be transported between the internal and external
environments of the cell (Figure 1B–3). It consists of a phospholipid bilayer,
proteins, carbohydrates and cholesterol.
The functions of the plasma membrane include but are not limited to:
• recognising other cells when forming tissue, or determining whether cells are foreign
•
during an immune response
• communicating with other cells
•
• selectively controlling which substances are transported into or out of the cell.
•
The process of transporting substances across the plasma membrane is explored in detail in
Chapter 2.

LINK
The phospholipid bilayer is arranged with the hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails facing
inwards and the hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads on the outsides of the membrane,
towards the watery internal and external environments. Because the plasma membrane
is made up of phospholipids, it is able to selectively allow different substances to enter
and leave the cell. Water-soluble (hydrophilic) substances need the assistance of a protein
channel to cross the phospholipid part of the membrane. Lipid-soluble (hydrophobic)
substances are able to cross through the phospholipids of the plasma membrane.

dissolves easily
in water; also
called lipophobic

2 List the key components of a plasma membrane.
3 Which part of the plasma membrane is hydrophilic?
Fluid mosaic model
A plasma membrane is made up of different types (a mosaic) of molecules. It is also fluid –
that is, the phospholipids and proteins are able to move around within each layer. Referring
to plasma membranes in this way is known as the fluid mosaic model (see Figure 1B–4 on the
previous page).
Recall that a phospholipid consists of a head and two tails, and the tails consist of fatty
acids. If these fatty acids only have single bonds between the carbon atoms (i.e. they are
‘saturated’), then they can pack together tightly. If the fatty acids have some double bonds
between carbon atoms (‘unsaturated’), then they pack together less tightly. If there are
unsaturated fatty acids in the tails, they have some double bonds between carbon atoms and
this makes them pack together less tightly. So more unsaturated fatty acids in the tails of
the phospholipids increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane (Figure 1B–5).

The difference between ‘identify’ and ‘explain’
The ability to identify the components of a plasma
membrane is a key skill. It is important that you
become familiar with a variety of representations
of the plasma membrane, as different diagrams can
be used during an assessment.
Figure 1B–6 is a representation of a plasma
membrane. If the question asks you to identify
some or all of the components, be succinct and
specific. If the question asks you to explain, this is
the time to elaborate on your answer.

12 CHAPTER 1 CELLULAR STRUCTURE
For example:
Question: Identify components A and E from the diagram of the plasma membrane
(Figure 1B–6).
Answer: A = phospholipid, E = cholesterol
This sample response has done exactly what the question required, without elaboration.
Question: Explain how you know whether a component of a plasma membrane is a
glycoprotein or a glycolipid.
Answer: A glycoprotein consists of a carbohydrate chain attached to a protein
molecule, as indicated by C in the diagram. A glycolipid, by comparison, consists of a
carbohydrate chain attached to a phospholipid, as indicated by B in the diagram.
This answer gives an elaborated response that demonstrates the ability to differentiate
between the two components of the plasma membrane. To ensure that the answer is
clear, a comparative term is included (‘by comparison’). The answer also incorporates
specific evidence from the diagram to further demonstrate the correct understanding of
the difference between the two components of the plasma membrane.

QUESTIONS
Using diagrams to answer questions
When providing examples of organisms that are either eukaryotic or prokaryotic, it is
important to use cellular features as your justification. A key cellular feature is the
presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles. If the cell contains a membrane-
bound organelle, then it is a eukaryote.
One type of organism that often causes confusion is protists. A protist is unicellular
but it is not a prokaryote. It is important to remember that some unicellular
organisms, such as paramecium, contain membrane-bound organelles, as shown in
Figure 1C–6. For this reason, a paramecium is classified as a eukaryote.

You could be asked to identify which of the examples are either a prokaryote or
a eukaryote. When a question asks you to identify, there is no need to include a
justification or explanation. All you need to do is put the example into a category, or
label it as either prokaryote or eukaryote.

Answer: C
As you can see, the answer consists of just the letter associated with the correct diagram.
This is in contrast to a question that asks you to justify your choice. For example:
Question: Provide a justification for why you have identified your answer as a
prokaryote.
Answer: C lacks membrane-bound organelles. The other two diagrams show a
nucleus or another membrane-bound organelle. Hence C is a prokaryote.
Note that the answer does not repeat the question, and it gives a specific piece of
evidence as the reason for the choice. The response also finishes by coming back to the
context of the question, re-stating that the chosen option is a prokaryote.

Symbiosis and endosymbiosis
Why does a mitochondrion have a double membrane, its own ribosomes and its own set
of DNA? Mitochondria are believed to have arisen as a result of one prokaryote engulfing
another, aerobic, prokaryote. An aerobic prokaryote is able to use oxygen to respire. The
first prokaryote – the one doing the engulfing – was then able to take on the respiratory
function of the aerobic prokaryote that it engulfed. The first prokaryote did not break
down the aerobic prokaryote; instead, it retained it and gained its aerobic function. This
kind of beneficial relationship between two organisms is called symbiosis, and if one of the
organisms lives inside the other it is referred to as endosymbiosis.
EXPLAIN
Benefits of compartmentalisation within cells
A cell can be thought of as a ‘reaction factory’, a place where many molecules (reactants)
interact to release new products. For a successful reaction, the molecules need to move into
and around the cell at the correct rate. They also need to be in the correct concentration for
specific chemical reactions to occur.
A eukaryotic cell is relatively large, making it more difficult for chemical reactions to occur
efficiently within it. This problem is overcome by having smaller compartments within the
cell. Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within a cell that perform specific
functions. Each individual organelle (except ribosomes) has a plasma membrane. This
membrane enables the organelle to maintain the concentrations of molecules at levels that
allow the reactants to interact with each other at optimal rates. The compartmentalisation
within organelles also allows various chemical reactions to occur simultaneously in different
places without interfering with each other (Figure 1D–1).
Reactant molecules
spread out in a large
compartment.
If the reactant molecules are
restricted to a smaller space by
being enclosed in an organelle,
they are more likely to bump
into each other and react.
More organelles allow other
specialised reactions to
take place without being
affected by the presence
of other reactants.

It is important to realise that cells do not all have the same types and numbers of organelles.
The types and numbers of organelles present in a cell are specific to the type of tissue in
which the cell is found. For example, a sperm cell requires a lot of energy, so you would
expect to find a large number of mitochondria in it, as mitochondria provide energy for the
cell. The secretory cells that line the stomach are part of the digestive system, and hence
they require a lot of Golgi apparatus to enable them to release enzymes (proteins) that aid
in the breakdown of food molecules.

Comparison of plant and animal cells
Plant cells and animal cells have many organelles in common, but there are some
differences (Figure 1D–4).
A misconception is that plant cells only perform photosynthesis and do not respire. In fact,
plant cells perform both photosynthesis and aerobic cellular respiration, and so a plant
cell has both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Not all the cells in a plant photosynthesise
(e.g. root cells do not photosynthesise), but they do all respire. In contrast, animal cells do
not have any chloroplasts, and do not photosynthesise.
Two further key differences between plant cells and animal cells:
• Cell wall – plant cells have a cell wall to aid with structural support for the whole plant,
•
whereas animal cells do not. Animals have other features, such as an exoskeleton or
bones, to provide support.
• Permanent vacuole – plant cells have a permanent large vacuole for the storage of
•
water, minerals and ions. The vacuole also assists with the structural support of the
cell through turgor pressure (pressure exerted by water). Animal cells do have vacuoles
but they are small and are not permanently present, and they do not provide structural
support to the cell.

1D SKILLS
Understanding processes through linked steps
A way to remember the function of different organelles is to include them in a series of
linked steps that form a process. For example, you can use steps to describe the process
of protein synthesis. You will meet this process in detail in Unit 3. Using steps in this way
will enable you to deepen your understanding and boost your ability to remember the key
organelles and their functions.

Figure 1D–5 Outline of protein synthesis
The process of protein synthesis is outlined in diagrammatic form in Figure 1D–5. The
steps in this process are as follows:
1 Conversion of DNA to RNA
• Within the nucleus, which contains the genetic material, the DNA is transcribed
•
to build RNA, which leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore.
2 Conversion of RNA to protein (translation)
• RNA is translated at a ribosome, which synthesises the corresponding protein. If the
•
protein is destined for the outside of the cell or the plasma membrane, the ribosome
is attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
3 Transportation of protein
• The rough endoplasmic reticulum transports the protein in a vesicle to the Golgi
•
apparatus.
4 Packaging of protein
• The Golgi apparatus modifies and packages the protein into a vesicle, ready for
•
exporting out of the cell.
5 Secretion of protein (exocytosis)
• The protein is released to the extracellular environment of the cell.
•
Creating flashcards
A further strategy to help you remember the functions of the organelles is to use the
diagrams and definitions from Table 1D–1 to create flip cards (flashcards). The more
you use images associated with terms and definitions, the easier it will be for you to
correctly recall the organelle functions.

ANSWERING
COMPARATIVE
QUESTIONS
Answering comparative questions
Answering comparison-based questions is a vital skill. Here is an example of how to
approach a comparative question in relation to animal and plant cells:
Question: What are two differences between the structure of a plant cell and the
structure of an animal cell?
Answer: A plant cell contains chloroplasts to perform photosynthesis, whereas
animal cells do not have chloroplasts. Also, a plant cell has a cell wall that surrounds
the plasma membrane, while an animal cell only has a plasma membrane as the
outermost layer of the cell.
Key points to remember when answering comparative questions:
• Make it clear that there is a comparison, by using terms such as ‘whereas’, ‘although’,
•
‘in contrast’, and ‘unlike’.
• If the question asks for a set number of comparisons, discuss one item in each
•
comparison. For example:
A plant cell has chloroplasts, whereas an animal cell does not.
A plant cell has a cell wall, but an animal cell does not.
▶ Avoid comparing multiple items at the same time, because if one item is wrong, it
▶
will make the whole comparison wrong. It can also mean that you run out of items
to compare.
• Keep your comparisons succinct and do not repeat the question.
•
In the example above, you would not begin your answer like this: ‘A difference
between a plant cell and an animal cell is that …’. If you find that you tend to do this,
try starting your answer after ‘that’ and go from there. You could also use dot points
when answering questions.
• Within your comparison, be sure to incorporate the content that you are most
•
confident with, to increase your likelihood of gaining full marks.

cells have chloroplasts (left).

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can use evidence from a diagram to explain the structure of the plasma membrane
CODE: 1B.5

WHAT (concept explanation):
This involves interpreting a diagram of the plasma membrane and using specific features shown in it to support an explanation. For example, explaining how you distinguish a glycoprotein from a glycolipid using visual evidence.

WHY (importance):
Explain questions require more than identification. You need to use the diagram as evidence and link structure to function with comparative language.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
To explain how saturated and unsaturated fatty acids affect fluidity: unsaturated tails have kinks caused by double bonds between carbon atoms, which prevent tight packing of phospholipids and increase the fluidity of the membrane.

SUBTOPIC: Plasma membrane
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the structure and function of the plasma membrane, including the phospholipid bilayer, proteins, carbohydrates and cholesterol. It also introduces the fluid mosaic model and the concepts of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: The plasma membrane controls what enters and leaves every cell, making it essential for cell survival. Understanding its structure helps you explain how different substances cross the membrane, which connects to transport processes covered later in the course.

TOPIC: Cellular structure
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 1
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Cells are the basic structural feature of life on Earth. This topic covers the distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the structure and function of the plasma membrane, and the specialisation of organelles for distinct functions.

Introduction
Cells are the basic structural feature of life on Earth. All cells have four features: genetic material,
plasma membrane, cytosol and ribosomes. Understanding the structural components of cells will
enable you to understand how different substances are processed within each cell. The plasma
membrane controls what enters or leaves the cell, and this function is vital in maintaining the
concentrations of reactants and products that enable the cell, and the organism, to function.
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes are the two main cell types, and being able to distinguish between
them is an important skill. Plants and animals are the two main groups of eukaryotic organisms.
Specialised structures within each cell are known as organelles, and in this chapter you will explore
the structure and function of each type of organelle.
The Interactive Textbook includes a worksheet, which discusses how to look at cells by using a
light microscope and how to represent cells using scientific drawings.

The largest living things
What is the biggest organism on Earth? Did you think of a blue whale? A blue whale
(Figure 1A–1) can grow to 30 metres long, and consists of about 100 quadrillion cells.
Compare this to an elephant’s 1000 trillion (or 1 quadrillion) cells, and a human’s
37.2 trillion cells.
In fact, none of these examples is the biggest organism on Earth. The biggest is a
fungus, Armillaria, commonly known as honey fungus (Figure 1A–2). The honey
fungus is known to stretch up to 3.8 km across the Blue Mountains in Oregon, in the
United States.

The examples given so far are multicellular
organisms. But what is the biggest
unicellular organism? An aquatic alga
called Caulerpa taxifolia (Figure 1A–3)
is unicellular, and can grow up to three
metres long.

EXPLAIN
An organism is defined as something that is living. But how do you know whether
something is living or not? In junior science, you learned the acronym MRSGREN
(movement, reproduction, sensitivity, growth, respiration, excretion, nutrition).
In VCE Biology, different criteria are used to distinguish between living and
non-living. The terms biotic (living) and abiotic (not living) are used.
An organism is made up of at least one cell. The cell is the basic unit of life, and
every cell comes from a pre-existing cell. This is known as cell theory.
The cells of plants, animals, bacteria and amoebas all have the following four
common factors (Figure 1A–4):
• genetic material
•
• cytosol
•
• ribosomes
•
• a plasma membrane.

1A SKILLS
Building a glossary
In studying Biology, you are required to remember, apply and explain many terms.
Before you start applying new terms, you need to understand them. A strategy to
achieve this is creating a glossary of your own, which will sharpen your skills
in defining terms.
To define is to state the precise nature or function of something. For example:
Question: Define ‘biotic’.
Answer: Living
You can elaborate on your response by explaining what ‘living’ means in a biological
setting.
Improved answer: ‘Biotic’ means living. A living thing consists of at least one cell,
which has a plasma membrane, genetic material, ribosomes and cytosol.
In both these instances, the define response does not go into detail with an example.
It simply explains what the term means, in the correct context.
Even if the answer is a single word, it can require you to use your understanding, as
shown in this example:
Question: Provide an example of a biotic factor essential for the survival of a
blue whale.
Answer: Krill
This answer requires an understanding of what ‘biotic’ means, and that the term does
not include other things that are also essential for survival, such as oxygen, which is an
abiotic factor.
To start creating your own glossary, you can use the highlighted glossary terms in
this textbook or download the online document, which has a list of key terms for
each chapter.

Structure and function of the plasma membrane
The structure of the plasma membrane relates to its function and the type
of cell it is in. The plasma membrane is a semi-permeable membrane that
allows substances to be transported between the internal and external
environments of the cell (Figure 1B–3). It consists of a phospholipid bilayer,
proteins, carbohydrates and cholesterol.
The functions of the plasma membrane include but are not limited to:
• recognising other cells when forming tissue, or determining whether cells are foreign
•
during an immune response
• communicating with other cells
•
• selectively controlling which substances are transported into or out of the cell.
•
The process of transporting substances across the plasma membrane is explored in detail in
Chapter 2.

TRANSPORT
LINK
The phospholipid bilayer is arranged with the hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails facing
inwards and the hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads on the outsides of the membrane,
towards the watery internal and external environments. Because the plasma membrane
is made up of phospholipids, it is able to selectively allow different substances to enter
and leave the cell. Water-soluble (hydrophilic) substances need the assistance of a protein
channel to cross the phospholipid part of the membrane. Lipid-soluble (hydrophobic)
substances are able to cross through the phospholipids of the plasma membrane.

called lipophobic

3 Which part of the plasma membrane is hydrophilic?
Fluid mosaic model
A plasma membrane is made up of different types (a mosaic) of molecules. It is also fluid –
that is, the phospholipids and proteins are able to move around within each layer. Referring
to plasma membranes in this way is known as the fluid mosaic model (see Figure 1B–4 on the
previous page).
Recall that a phospholipid consists of a head and two tails, and the tails consist of fatty
acids. If these fatty acids only have single bonds between the carbon atoms (i.e. they are
‘saturated’), then they can pack together tightly. If the fatty acids have some double bonds
between carbon atoms (‘unsaturated’), then they pack together less tightly. If there are
unsaturated fatty acids in the tails, they have some double bonds between carbon atoms and
this makes them pack together less tightly. So more unsaturated fatty acids in the tails of
the phospholipids increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane (Figure 1B–5).

The difference between ‘identify’ and ‘explain’
The ability to identify the components of a plasma
membrane is a key skill. It is important that you
become familiar with a variety of representations
of the plasma membrane, as different diagrams can
be used during an assessment.
Figure 1B–6 is a representation of a plasma
membrane. If the question asks you to identify
some or all of the components, be succinct and
specific. If the question asks you to explain, this is
the time to elaborate on your answer.

12 CHAPTER 1 CELLULAR STRUCTURE
For example:
Question: Identify components A and E from the diagram of the plasma membrane
(Figure 1B–6).
Answer: A = phospholipid, E = cholesterol
This sample response has done exactly what the question required, without elaboration.
Question: Explain how you know whether a component of a plasma membrane is a
glycoprotein or a glycolipid.
Answer: A glycoprotein consists of a carbohydrate chain attached to a protein
molecule, as indicated by C in the diagram. A glycolipid, by comparison, consists of a
carbohydrate chain attached to a phospholipid, as indicated by B in the diagram.
This answer gives an elaborated response that demonstrates the ability to differentiate
between the two components of the plasma membrane. To ensure that the answer is
clear, a comparative term is included (‘by comparison’). The answer also incorporates
specific evidence from the diagram to further demonstrate the correct understanding of
the difference between the two components of the plasma membrane.

QUESTIONS
Using diagrams to answer questions
When providing examples of organisms that are either eukaryotic or prokaryotic, it is
important to use cellular features as your justification. A key cellular feature is the
presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles. If the cell contains a membrane-
bound organelle, then it is a eukaryote.
One type of organism that often causes confusion is protists. A protist is unicellular
but it is not a prokaryote. It is important to remember that some unicellular
organisms, such as paramecium, contain membrane-bound organelles, as shown in
Figure 1C–6. For this reason, a paramecium is classified as a eukaryote.

justification or explanation. All you need to do is put the example into a category, or
label it as either prokaryote or eukaryote.

Symbiosis and endosymbiosis
Why does a mitochondrion have a double membrane, its own ribosomes and its own set
of DNA? Mitochondria are believed to have arisen as a result of one prokaryote engulfing
another, aerobic, prokaryote. An aerobic prokaryote is able to use oxygen to respire. The
first prokaryote – the one doing the engulfing – was then able to take on the respiratory
function of the aerobic prokaryote that it engulfed. The first prokaryote did not break
down the aerobic prokaryote; instead, it retained it and gained its aerobic function. This
kind of beneficial relationship between two organisms is called symbiosis, and if one of the
organisms lives inside the other it is referred to as endosymbiosis.
EXPLAIN
Benefits of compartmentalisation within cells
A cell can be thought of as a ‘reaction factory’, a place where many molecules (reactants)
interact to release new products. For a successful reaction, the molecules need to move into
and around the cell at the correct rate. They also need to be in the correct concentration for
specific chemical reactions to occur.
A eukaryotic cell is relatively large, making it more difficult for chemical reactions to occur
efficiently within it. This problem is overcome by having smaller compartments within the
cell. Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within a cell that perform specific
functions. Each individual organelle (except ribosomes) has a plasma membrane. This
membrane enables the organelle to maintain the concentrations of molecules at levels that
allow the reactants to interact with each other at optimal rates. The compartmentalisation
within organelles also allows various chemical reactions to occur simultaneously in different
places without interfering with each other (Figure 1D–1).
Reactant molecules
spread out in a large
compartment.
If the reactant molecules are
restricted to a smaller space by
being enclosed in an organelle,
they are more likely to bump
into each other and react.
More organelles allow other
specialised reactions to
take place without being
affected by the presence
of other reactants.

It is important to realise that cells do not all have the same types and numbers of organelles.
The types and numbers of organelles present in a cell are specific to the type of tissue in
which the cell is found. For example, a sperm cell requires a lot of energy, so you would
expect to find a large number of mitochondria in it, as mitochondria provide energy for the
cell. The secretory cells that line the stomach are part of the digestive system, and hence
they require a lot of Golgi apparatus to enable them to release enzymes (proteins) that aid
in the breakdown of food molecules.

Comparison of plant and animal cells
Plant cells and animal cells have many organelles in common, but there are some
differences (Figure 1D–4).
A misconception is that plant cells only perform photosynthesis and do not respire. In fact,
plant cells perform both photosynthesis and aerobic cellular respiration, and so a plant
cell has both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Not all the cells in a plant photosynthesise
(e.g. root cells do not photosynthesise), but they do all respire. In contrast, animal cells do
not have any chloroplasts, and do not photosynthesise.
Two further key differences between plant cells and animal cells:
• Cell wall – plant cells have a cell wall to aid with structural support for the whole plant,
•
whereas animal cells do not. Animals have other features, such as an exoskeleton or
bones, to provide support.
• Permanent vacuole – plant cells have a permanent large vacuole for the storage of
•
water, minerals and ions. The vacuole also assists with the structural support of the
cell through turgor pressure (pressure exerted by water). Animal cells do have vacuoles
but they are small and are not permanently present, and they do not provide structural
support to the cell.

1D SKILLS
Understanding processes through linked steps
A way to remember the function of different organelles is to include them in a series of
linked steps that form a process. For example, you can use steps to describe the process
of protein synthesis. You will meet this process in detail in Unit 3. Using steps in this way
will enable you to deepen your understanding and boost your ability to remember the key
organelles and their functions.

Figure 1D–5 Outline of protein synthesis
The process of protein synthesis is outlined in diagrammatic form in Figure 1D–5. The
steps in this process are as follows:
1 Conversion of DNA to RNA
• Within the nucleus, which contains the genetic material, the DNA is transcribed
•
to build RNA, which leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore.
2 Conversion of RNA to protein (translation)
• RNA is translated at a ribosome, which synthesises the corresponding protein. If the
•
protein is destined for the outside of the cell or the plasma membrane, the ribosome
is attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
3 Transportation of protein
• The rough endoplasmic reticulum transports the protein in a vesicle to the Golgi
•
apparatus.
4 Packaging of protein
• The Golgi apparatus modifies and packages the protein into a vesicle, ready for
•
exporting out of the cell.
5 Secretion of protein (exocytosis)
• The protein is released to the extracellular environment of the cell.
•
Creating flashcards
A further strategy to help you remember the functions of the organelles is to use the
diagrams and definitions from Table 1D–1 to create flip cards (flashcards). The more
you use images associated with terms and definitions, the easier it will be for you to
correctly recall the organelle functions.

ANSWERING
COMPARATIVE
QUESTIONS
Answering comparative questions
Answering comparison-based questions is a vital skill. Here is an example of how to
approach a comparative question in relation to animal and plant cells:
Question: What are two differences between the structure of a plant cell and the
structure of an animal cell?
Answer: A plant cell contains chloroplasts to perform photosynthesis, whereas
animal cells do not have chloroplasts. Also, a plant cell has a cell wall that surrounds
the plasma membrane, while an animal cell only has a plasma membrane as the
outermost layer of the cell.
Key points to remember when answering comparative questions:
• Make it clear that there is a comparison, by using terms such as ‘whereas’, ‘although’,
•
‘in contrast’, and ‘unlike’.
• If the question asks for a set number of comparisons, discuss one item in each
•
comparison. For example:
A plant cell has chloroplasts, whereas an animal cell does not.
A plant cell has a cell wall, but an animal cell does not.
▶ Avoid comparing multiple items at the same time, because if one item is wrong, it
▶
will make the whole comparison wrong. It can also mean that you run out of items
to compare.
• Keep your comparisons succinct and do not repeat the question.
•
In the example above, you would not begin your answer like this: ‘A difference
between a plant cell and an animal cell is that …’. If you find that you tend to do this,
try starting your answer after ‘that’ and go from there. You could also use dot points
when answering questions.
• Within your comparison, be sure to incorporate the content that you are most
•
confident with, to increase your likelihood of gaining full marks.

cells have chloroplasts (left).

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
