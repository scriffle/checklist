      "correct": "Genetic material instructs ribosomes, which make proteins in the cytosol, contained by the membrane",
      "correctExplanation": "This chain of events shows how all four features are interconnected: DNA provides instructions, ribosomes execute them in cytosol, within the membrane boundary.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Each feature operates completely independently of the other three", "explanation": "The features are deeply interdependent; removing one disrupts the entire system." },

      "correct": "Loss of the plasma membrane, as cell contents would immediately disperse",
      "correctExplanation": "Without the membrane, the physical integrity of the cell is lost instantly, while loss of other features would show effects more gradually.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "All four losses would show effects at exactly the same rate", "explanation": "Membrane loss causes immediate physical disintegration, while other losses allow gradual decline." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Having all four features automatically makes it alive with certainty", "explanation": "Life requires active processes like metabolism; simply having structures is not enough." },

        { "answer": "Both mutations would have identical outcomes for cell survival always", "explanation": "The severity differs greatly; reduced efficiency is survivable while total membrane loss is not." },
