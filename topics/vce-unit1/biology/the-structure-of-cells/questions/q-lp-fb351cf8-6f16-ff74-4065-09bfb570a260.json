      "correct": "Both respire, but only the leaf cell photosynthesises",

      "correct": "During the day, photosynthesis absorbs more CO2 than respiration releases",
      "correctExplanation": "The net absorption of CO2 during the day shows that the rate of photosynthesis exceeds the rate of respiration. At night, only respiration occurs.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The plant stops respiring during the day completely", "explanation": "Respiration continues during the day; photosynthesis simply uses more CO2 than respiration produces." },
        { "answer": "The plant photosynthesises at night and respires during the day", "explanation": "This is reversed; photosynthesis requires light and occurs during the day." },

      "correct": "Shade plants may have more chloroplasts per cell to maximise light capture",
