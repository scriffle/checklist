      "why": "Reading chemical formulas correctly is essential for understanding what substances are made of and how they react with each other.",

      "why": "Knowing whether a compound is ionic or covalent determines how you name it and write its formula, since they follow different rules.",

      "why": "Recognising whether a change is physical or chemical helps predict whether the original substances can be recovered and what properties the result will have.",

      "example": "When nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂) react during a lightning strike, the bonds in N₂ and O₂ break, and the atoms recombine to form nitrogen oxide (NO). The nitrogen and oxygen atoms are rearranged but not created or destroyed.",

      "why": "A systematic approach helps solve equations that cannot be balanced by trial and error alone.",
      "example": "For CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O: Balance C first (1 on each side). Balance H next: 4 H on left needs 2H₂O on right. Balance O last: 2 O in CO₂ + 2 O in 2H₂O = 4 O total, so need 2O₂. Final: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O.",

      "why": "Understanding this distinction prevents errors in balancing and ensures equations represent the actual substances involved.",
      "example": "Changing H₂O to H₂O₂ would change water into hydrogen peroxide, a completely different chemical. But changing H₂O to 2H₂O just means two water molecules, which is valid for balancing.",

      "example": "When charcoal burns, it reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide gas. The charcoal appears to lose mass because the CO₂ escapes. If you could capture and weigh all the CO₂, the total mass would be unchanged.",

      "example": "Using coloured balls for atoms: to model N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃, you start with 2 blue nitrogen balls bonded together and 6 white hydrogen balls in 3 pairs. You rearrange them into 2 ammonia molecules, each with 1 nitrogen and 3 hydrogens.",
