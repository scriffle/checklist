      "why": "Knowing particle properties helps you understand why atoms are electrically neutral and how ions form when electrons are gained or lost.",
      "example": "A carbon atom has 6 protons (+6 charge) and 6 electrons (-6 charge) in the nucleus, giving it no overall charge. The 6 neutrons add mass but no charge.",
