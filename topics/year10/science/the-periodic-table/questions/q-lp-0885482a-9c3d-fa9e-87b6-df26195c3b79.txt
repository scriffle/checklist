TITLE: I can write electron configurations using comma notation
CODE: 2.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
Electron configuration notation lists the number of electrons in each shell, separated by commas. For example, chlorine with 17 electrons has the configuration 2,8,7.

WHY (importance):
This notation provides a quick way to communicate electron arrangement without drawing diagrams.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Potassium has 19 electrons. Its electron configuration is 2,8,8,1 showing electrons distributed across four shells.

SUBTOPIC: Electron Configuration
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers how electrons are arranged in shells around the nucleus. You will learn the rules for filling electron shells and how to represent electron arrangements using shell diagrams and electron configuration notation.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Electron configuration determines an element's chemical behaviour. Elements react to achieve stable, full outer shells, so knowing how electrons are arranged lets you predict how elements will bond and react.

TOPIC: The Periodic Table
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: Year 10
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Understanding how atomic structure and properties of elements are used to organise them in the periodic table, and how position predicts chemical behaviour.

Characteristics of atoms

	Atoms are _____________________________________
	Atoms of the same element have the same number of negative _____________ and positive _______________
	Atomic number of an element = number of _____________________ (Symbol = Z)
	Mass number of an element = number of ___________ and number of ____________ (Symbol = A)
	Isotopes = atoms with the same number of protons, different number of neutrons
Representing elements 

The following diagram is typical of how one element is represented on a periodic table.












	
	
	

From the periodic table representation
	we can get the number of ___________________________ (atomic number)
	we can get number of _______________________________ (atoms are neutral)

	All atoms have the same number of protons and electrons. Why is it important for there to be the same number of electrons and protons in an atom?

Atoms form ions when they gain or lose electrons

	A neutral atom has the same number of ____________________ and ____________________.
	Ions result from atoms that have ____________________ or ____________________ electrons. 
	An atom which has lost one or more electrons has an overall ____________________ charge. It is known as a cation. 
	An atom which has gained one or more electrons has an overall ____________________ charge. It is known as an anion.
THE NUMBER OF PROTONS IS ALWAYS UNCHANGED – ONLY ELECTRONS ARE LOST OR GAINED TO FORM IONS

Lesson 4: Family Groupings 1:
Metals and the Periodic Table
Taking Note

Why does the periodic table look like it does?
It is no accident that the elements in the periodic table are arranged as you see them in the periodic table below.

Let’s review
















	How many electrons are in the outer (valence) shell of 
	the group 1 metal?	____________________
	the group 2 metals?	____________________
	the group 17 halogens? 	____________________
	the group 18 noble gases?	____________________

	What is the link between group number and electron arrangement?  _________________________________________
	What is the link between period number and electron arrangement?  ________________________________________

All elements in the periodic table want to be a noble gas!
This means they want:
	to be _________________________________________
	to have _______________________________________
Metals and the Periodic Table
There are only 1 or 2 electrons in the valence shell (outer shell) of the atoms of most metals. 
Metals want to be __________________ and want to have a _______________ outer shell (2, 8) electrons like the stable _________________ gases.

They readily give away their electrons.
 
Complete the diagram below.
 

With _____________electrons in its outer shell, magnesium loses them to get the same electronic configuration of the noble gas ___________________ and is stable as a __________ ion. 

	Metals will be more reactive when _____________________________________________________________________.
	Electrons are held more weakly when they are ________________________________________________________.
	Hence, metallic elements with BIGGER atoms are MORE REACTIVE.

Practice what you know.
What do you need to remember about the metals in group 1 and 2 of the periodic table?
Complete the following summary tables.
	Softness	Reactivity
 	
The metals of group 1 and 2 become softer as you go down the group because the metallic bonding is stronger/weaker (circle one). 

This is because the valence electrons are closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.	
The metals of group 1 and 2 become
more reactive/less reactive (circle one) down the group.

This is because the valence electrons are closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.

Valence electrons that are further from the nucleus are given way 
more easily/less easily (circle one) and, hence, react more readily.

Common Reaction Pattern

The type of reaction taking place between a group 1 and 2 metals and water is always the same. 
These reactions can be described by word equations such as:

metal (solid) + water (liquid) → metal hydroxide (solution) + hydrogen (gas)

For example: 
lithium (solid) + water (liquid) → lithium hydroxide (solution) + hydrogen (gas)

1.	Complete the word equations for the other metals observed in this demonstration. (4 marks)

sodium (solid) + water (liquid)  →  


potassium (solid) + water (liquid)  →


magnesium (solid) + water (liquid)  →             


calcium (solid) + water (liquid)  →                 


Observations

2.	Considering the reactions that take place, what can the following observations be attributed to? Identify the key chemical that is evident by this observation. 

a.	Fizzing (2 marks)


b.	The phenolphthalein indicator turned from colorless to pink when the pH of the solutions becomes basic. (2 marks)


Different Reactivity

The main difference in these metals is how vigorously they reacted with the water.

3.	List the names of the group 1 metals from least reactive to most reactive. (1 mark)


Least reactive	   	               Most reactive





What do we see this pattern of reactivity in group 1 and group 2 metals?

Complete these sentences: (7 marks)

•	Group 1 and group 2 metals become more reactive as we go down a ______________________________. 

•	Group 1 metals have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	Group 2 metals have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	Elements are stable when they have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	To become stable, group 1 elements easily lose 1 electron/gain 7 electrons (circle one).

•	To become stable, group 2 elements easily lose 2 electron/gain 6 electrons (circle one).


How easily elements can lose or gain electrons to become stable determines their reactivity. 

•	For group 1 and group 2, this depends on how close the negative/positive (circle one) valence electron is to the negative/positive (circle one) nucleus of the atom.

•	As we go down a group, the period number decrease/increase (circle one) and so does the number of filled electron _______________.

•	As the number of electrons shells increases, the valence electrons get closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.

•	The further from the nucleus, the less/more (circle one) strongly the negative valence electron is held to the positive nucleus and the easier/harder (circle one) it is lose electrons to become stable, and the less/more reactive the atom is.

4.	Use the sentences above to write a summary sentence explaining the relative reactivity of group 1 and group 2 elements as you go down a group (2 marks).






Part 2: Reaction with Chlorine gas

Group 1 and 2 metals react with chlorine gas to produce a metal chloride compound.  Like metals reacting with water, metals reacting with chlorine gas show different chemical reactivities.

Common Reaction Pattern

The type of reaction taking place between a group 1 and 2 metals and chlorine is always the same. 
These reactions can be described by word equations such as:

metal (solid) + chlorine (gas) → metal chloride (solid) 

For example: 
lithium (solid) + chlorine (gas) → lithium chloride (solid) 

5.	Complete the word equations for the other metals observed in this demonstration. (3 marks)

sodium (solid) + + chlorine (gas)   →

h.	Why do group 1 metals form MCl, while group 2 metals form MCl2 (1 mark). 




Summary: (5 marks)

•	Group 1 and group 2 metals react with water to produce a _____________ hydroxide and ______________ gas, with ___________________ reactivity down the group.

•	When reacted with water, fizzing and gas production indicate _____________________________ gas release, while phenolphthalein turning pink confirms the formation of a(n) acid/basic (circle one) solution.

•	Group 1 and 2 metals react with chlorine gas to form solid __________________ chlorides in _________________ (heat releasing) reactions, with ___________________ reactivity down the group.

•	Group 1 metals react less/more (circle one) vigorously than group 2 metals it is easier/harder (circle one) to lose a single valence electron than to lose two.

•	As atomic size increases down a group (more filled shells), valence electrons are held weakly/strongly (circle one), making them easier to lose and increasing metal reactivity.

COGNITIVE LEVEL: toLevel2 (Remember)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TARGET: Basic recall and recognition.
TEST: Can student retrieve relevant knowledge from memory?
QUESTION TYPES: Define terms, identify components, recall facts, match definitions.
STEMS: "What is...", "Which of the following is...", "The term for... is...", "Identify the..."
AVOID: Application, inference, or synthesis. Test recognition, not deeper understanding.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

LEARNING POINT CONTEXT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TITLE: I can write electron configurations using comma notation
CODE: 2.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
Electron configuration notation lists the number of electrons in each shell, separated by commas. For example, chlorine with 17 electrons has the configuration 2,8,7.

WHY (importance):
This notation provides a quick way to communicate electron arrangement without drawing diagrams.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Potassium has 19 electrons. Its electron configuration is 2,8,8,1 showing electrons distributed across four shells.

SUBTOPIC: Electron Configuration
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers how electrons are arranged in shells around the nucleus. You will learn the rules for filling electron shells and how to represent electron arrangements using shell diagrams and electron configuration notation.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Electron configuration determines an element's chemical behaviour. Elements react to achieve stable, full outer shells, so knowing how electrons are arranged lets you predict how elements will bond and react.

TOPIC: The Periodic Table
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: Year 10
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Understanding how atomic structure and properties of elements are used to organise them in the periodic table, and how position predicts chemical behaviour.

What can we know about an element just by looking at the periodic table?
The periodic table is like a map. There is a lot of information contained in it if you know what to look for and all of it links to what we know about atoms.











Review Atomic Structure

The three subatomic particles most important to Chemists are
	protons
	neutrons
	electrons

Label the following diagram of an atom and complete the table.





Particle	Symbol	Location	Charge	Mass (atomic mass units)
proton

Characteristics of atoms

	Atoms are _____________________________________
	Atoms of the same element have the same number of negative _____________ and positive _______________
	Atomic number of an element = number of _____________________ (Symbol = Z)
	Mass number of an element = number of ___________ and number of ____________ (Symbol = A)
	Isotopes = atoms with the same number of protons, different number of neutrons
Representing elements 

The following diagram is typical of how one element is represented on a periodic table.












	
	
	

From the periodic table representation
	we can get the number of ___________________________ (atomic number)
	we can get number of _______________________________ (atoms are neutral)
	we cannot get the number of ___________________________
The atoms of the elements in periodic table can be represented in other ways too.

	Which subatomic particle is used to identify an element?


	What does the atomic number tell us about the subatomic particles of this element?


	What does the mass number indicate about the atoms of this element?


	All atoms have the same number of protons and electrons. Why is it important for there to be the same number of electrons and protons in an atom?

Atoms form ions when they gain or lose electrons

	A neutral atom has the same number of ____________________ and ____________________.
	Ions result from atoms that have ____________________ or ____________________ electrons. 
	An atom which has lost one or more electrons has an overall ____________________ charge. It is known as a cation. 
	An atom which has gained one or more electrons has an overall ____________________ charge. It is known as an anion.
THE NUMBER OF PROTONS IS ALWAYS UNCHANGED – ONLY ELECTRONS ARE LOST OR GAINED TO FORM IONS

Isotopes of elements have same atomic number but different mass numbers
	Isotopes have the same number of ______________ (therefore are the same element) but differ in the number of ____________________ in the nucleus.

	As isotopes have the same number of __________________, they have the same chemical properties – all behave in the same way chemically as each other. 

	As isotopes have different masses, they will have different physical properties such as density (mass/size), rate of diffusion, melting temperature and so on.

What do you need to remember about the metals in group 1 and 2 of the periodic table?
Complete the following summary tables.
	Softness	Reactivity
 	
The metals of group 1 and 2 become softer as you go down the group because the metallic bonding is stronger/weaker (circle one). 

This is because the valence electrons are closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.	
The metals of group 1 and 2 become
more reactive/less reactive (circle one) down the group.

This is because the valence electrons are closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.

Valence electrons that are further from the nucleus are given way 
more easily/less easily (circle one) and, hence, react more readily.

Common Reaction Pattern

The type of reaction taking place between a group 1 and 2 metals and water is always the same. 
These reactions can be described by word equations such as:

metal (solid) + water (liquid) → metal hydroxide (solution) + hydrogen (gas)

For example: 
lithium (solid) + water (liquid) → lithium hydroxide (solution) + hydrogen (gas)

1.	Complete the word equations for the other metals observed in this demonstration. (4 marks)

sodium (solid) + water (liquid)  →  


potassium (solid) + water (liquid)  →


magnesium (solid) + water (liquid)  →             


calcium (solid) + water (liquid)  →                 


Observations

2.	Considering the reactions that take place, what can the following observations be attributed to? Identify the key chemical that is evident by this observation. 

a.	Fizzing (2 marks)


b.	The phenolphthalein indicator turned from colorless to pink when the pH of the solutions becomes basic. (2 marks)


Different Reactivity

The main difference in these metals is how vigorously they reacted with the water.

3.	List the names of the group 1 metals from least reactive to most reactive. (1 mark)


Least reactive	   	               Most reactive





What do we see this pattern of reactivity in group 1 and group 2 metals?

Complete these sentences: (7 marks)

•	Group 1 and group 2 metals become more reactive as we go down a ______________________________. 

•	Group 1 metals have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	Group 2 metals have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	Elements are stable when they have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	To become stable, group 1 elements easily lose 1 electron/gain 7 electrons (circle one).

•	To become stable, group 2 elements easily lose 2 electron/gain 6 electrons (circle one).


How easily elements can lose or gain electrons to become stable determines their reactivity. 

•	For group 1 and group 2, this depends on how close the negative/positive (circle one) valence electron is to the negative/positive (circle one) nucleus of the atom.

•	As we go down a group, the period number decrease/increase (circle one) and so does the number of filled electron _______________.

•	As the number of electrons shells increases, the valence electrons get closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.

•	The further from the nucleus, the less/more (circle one) strongly the negative valence electron is held to the positive nucleus and the easier/harder (circle one) it is lose electrons to become stable, and the less/more reactive the atom is.

4.	Use the sentences above to write a summary sentence explaining the relative reactivity of group 1 and group 2 elements as you go down a group (2 marks).

Different Reactivity

List the names of the group 17 halogens from least reactive to most reactive. (1 mark)


Least reactive	   	               Most reactive

What do we see this pattern of reactivity in group 17 halogens?

•	Group 17 non-metals have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	Elements are stable when they have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	To become stable, group 17 elements easily lose 7 electrons/gain 1 electrons (circle one).


How easily elements can lose or gain electrons to become stable determines their reactivity. 

•	For group 17 elements, this depends on how close the shell that accepts a positive/negative (circle one) electron is to the negative/positive (circle one) nucleus of the atom.

•	As we go down a group, the period number decrease/increase (circle one) and so does the number of filled electron _______________.

•	As the number of electrons shells increases, the shell that accepts an electron is closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.

•	The further from the nucleus, the less/more (circle one) strongly the incoming negative valence electron is attracted to the positive nucleus and the easier/harder (circle one) it is gain electrons to become stable, and the less/more reactive the atom is.

COGNITIVE LEVEL: toLevel3 (Understand)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TARGET: Demonstrate comprehension of concepts.
TEST: Can student explain ideas in their own words or recognise examples?
QUESTION TYPES: Explain concepts, interpret meanings, classify examples, summarise relationships.
STEMS: "Which statement best explains...", "What does X mean...", "An example of X would be...", "Why does..."
AVOID: Direct recall of definitions. Require paraphrasing or recognition in new contexts.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

LEARNING POINT CONTEXT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TITLE: I can write electron configurations using comma notation
CODE: 2.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
Electron configuration notation lists the number of electrons in each shell, separated by commas. For example, chlorine with 17 electrons has the configuration 2,8,7.

WHY (importance):
This notation provides a quick way to communicate electron arrangement without drawing diagrams.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Potassium has 19 electrons. Its electron configuration is 2,8,8,1 showing electrons distributed across four shells.

SUBTOPIC: Electron Configuration
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers how electrons are arranged in shells around the nucleus. You will learn the rules for filling electron shells and how to represent electron arrangements using shell diagrams and electron configuration notation.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Electron configuration determines an element's chemical behaviour. Elements react to achieve stable, full outer shells, so knowing how electrons are arranged lets you predict how elements will bond and react.

TOPIC: The Periodic Table
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: Year 10
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Understanding how atomic structure and properties of elements are used to organise them in the periodic table, and how position predicts chemical behaviour.

Characteristics of atoms

	Atoms are _____________________________________
	Atoms of the same element have the same number of negative _____________ and positive _______________
	Atomic number of an element = number of _____________________ (Symbol = Z)
	Mass number of an element = number of ___________ and number of ____________ (Symbol = A)
	Isotopes = atoms with the same number of protons, different number of neutrons
Representing elements 

The following diagram is typical of how one element is represented on a periodic table.












	
	
	

From the periodic table representation
	we can get the number of ___________________________ (atomic number)
	we can get number of _______________________________ (atoms are neutral)

Lesson 4: Family Groupings 1:
Metals and the Periodic Table
Taking Note

Why does the periodic table look like it does?
It is no accident that the elements in the periodic table are arranged as you see them in the periodic table below.

Let’s review
















	How many electrons are in the outer (valence) shell of 
	the group 1 metal?	____________________
	the group 2 metals?	____________________
	the group 17 halogens? 	____________________
	the group 18 noble gases?	____________________

	What is the link between group number and electron arrangement?  _________________________________________
	What is the link between period number and electron arrangement?  ________________________________________

All elements in the periodic table want to be a noble gas!
This means they want:
	to be _________________________________________
	to have _______________________________________
Metals and the Periodic Table
There are only 1 or 2 electrons in the valence shell (outer shell) of the atoms of most metals. 
Metals want to be __________________ and want to have a _______________ outer shell (2, 8) electrons like the stable _________________ gases.

They readily give away their electrons.
 
Complete the diagram below.
 

With _____________electrons in its outer shell, magnesium loses them to get the same electronic configuration of the noble gas ___________________ and is stable as a __________ ion. 

	Metals will be more reactive when _____________________________________________________________________.
	Electrons are held more weakly when they are ________________________________________________________.
	Hence, metallic elements with BIGGER atoms are MORE REACTIVE.

Predict the order, from LEAST reactive to MOST reactive in the
                                                        LEAST REACTIVE                                                     MOST REACTIVE

Complete the student response sheet in your Practical Portfolio and submit for assessment by the due date.

Practice what you know.
What do you need to remember about the metals in group 1 and 2 of the periodic table?
Complete the following summary tables.
	Softness	Reactivity
 	
The metals of group 1 and 2 become softer as you go down the group because the metallic bonding is stronger/weaker (circle one). 

This is because the valence electrons are closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.	
The metals of group 1 and 2 become
more reactive/less reactive (circle one) down the group.

This is because the valence electrons are closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.

Valence electrons that are further from the nucleus are given way 
more easily/less easily (circle one) and, hence, react more readily.

Lesson 5: Family Groupings 2:
Non-Metals and the Periodic Table

Taking Note
Recall that chemical reactivity is determined by the outer shell electron arrangement of the atoms of an element. 

In this lesson you will be looking at the electron arrangement of the elements in group 17 and 18 of the periodic table and how this influences the chemical and physical properties of these elements.	


Let’s Review

All elements in the periodic table want to be a noble gas!
This means they want:
	to be _________________________________________
	to have _______________________________________


Non-metals and the Periodic Table
There are 7 or 8 electrons in the valence shell (outer shell) of the halogens and noble gases, respectively. 
Noble gases: Group 18 non-metals
Noble gases are __________________ as they already have _______________ valence shell (2, 8) electrons. They are unreactive.
They hold onto their electrons.
 
Complete the diagram below.
 
Nobel gases are __________________, which means they are/are not (circle one) reactive.
Halogens: Group 7 non-metals
Halogens want to be __________________ and want to have _______________ valence shell (2, 8) electrons like the stable _________________ gases.

They readily accept electrons from other elements
 

Complete the diagram below.
 

With _____________electrons in its outer shell, fluorine gains electrons from other electrons to get the same electronic configuration of the noble gas ___________________ and is stable as a __________ ion. 

	Non-metals will be more reactive when the valence shell is ____________________________________
	Electrons from other elements are attracted more easily when they are ____________________________
	Hence, non-metallic elements with SMALLER atoms are MORE reactive.

Predict the order, from LEAST reactive to MOST reactive in the

b.	Using the Trends (6 marks)
Melting point is an excellent indicator of how strongly the particles in a substance are bonded together. 
In general: 
The higher the melting point,
the stronger the bonding holding the particles together in the substance.

Using this idea and the trends evident in the graphs that you produced to answer the following questions.
Does the bonding between metal atoms increase or decrease down a group? Use data to justify your answer.





Does the bonding between non-metal atoms increase or decrease down a group? Use data to justify your answer.





In general, would you consider the bonding between metal atoms to be stronger or weaker than the bonding between non-metal atoms? Use data to justify your answer.

Assessment Practical Part 3 
Patterns in the Periodic Table and Metal Reactivity

Name: _____________________________________________________________
	
It is no accident that certain elements have been arranged into the same group in the periodic table. Elements in the same group chemically react in the same way because they have the same number of electrons in the outer shell.

Common Reaction Pattern

The type of reaction taking place between a group 1 and 2 metals and water is always the same. 
These reactions can be described by word equations such as:

metal (solid) + water (liquid) → metal hydroxide (solution) + hydrogen (gas)

For example: 
lithium (solid) + water (liquid) → lithium hydroxide (solution) + hydrogen (gas)

1.	Complete the word equations for the other metals observed in this demonstration. (4 marks)

sodium (solid) + water (liquid)  →  


potassium (solid) + water (liquid)  →


magnesium (solid) + water (liquid)  →             


calcium (solid) + water (liquid)  →                 


Observations

2.	Considering the reactions that take place, what can the following observations be attributed to? Identify the key chemical that is evident by this observation. 

a.	Fizzing (2 marks)


b.	The phenolphthalein indicator turned from colorless to pink when the pH of the solutions becomes basic. (2 marks)


Different Reactivity

The main difference in these metals is how vigorously they reacted with the water.

3.	List the names of the group 1 metals from least reactive to most reactive. (1 mark)


Least reactive	   	               Most reactive





What do we see this pattern of reactivity in group 1 and group 2 metals?

Complete these sentences: (7 marks)

•	Group 1 and group 2 metals become more reactive as we go down a ______________________________. 

•	Group 1 metals have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	Group 2 metals have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	Elements are stable when they have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	To become stable, group 1 elements easily lose 1 electron/gain 7 electrons (circle one).

•	To become stable, group 2 elements easily lose 2 electron/gain 6 electrons (circle one).


How easily elements can lose or gain electrons to become stable determines their reactivity. 

•	For group 1 and group 2, this depends on how close the negative/positive (circle one) valence electron is to the negative/positive (circle one) nucleus of the atom.

•	As we go down a group, the period number decrease/increase (circle one) and so does the number of filled electron _______________.

•	As the number of electrons shells increases, the valence electrons get closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.

•	The further from the nucleus, the less/more (circle one) strongly the negative valence electron is held to the positive nucleus and the easier/harder (circle one) it is lose electrons to become stable, and the less/more reactive the atom is.

4.	Use the sentences above to write a summary sentence explaining the relative reactivity of group 1 and group 2 elements as you go down a group (2 marks).






Part 2: Reaction with Chlorine gas

Group 1 and 2 metals react with chlorine gas to produce a metal chloride compound.  Like metals reacting with water, metals reacting with chlorine gas show different chemical reactivities. 
You can see these reactions in the following videos. These can be accessed in STILE Year 10 Chemistry 2025 module under the tab Assessment Practical Part 3 (Links and Videos)

Reaction of Chlorine with Potassium https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRHZIir1Uno&t=13s
Reaction of Chlorine with Magnesium https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIH0M0eoDhE


Common Reaction Pattern

The type of reaction taking place between a group 1 and 2 metals and chlorine is always the same. 
These reactions can be described by word equations such as:

metal (solid) + chlorine (gas) → metal chloride (solid) 

For example: 
lithium (solid) + chlorine (gas) → lithium chloride (solid) 

5.	Complete the word equations for the other metals observed in this demonstration. (3 marks)

sodium (solid) + + chlorine (gas)   →

Summary: (5 marks)

•	Group 1 and group 2 metals react with water to produce a _____________ hydroxide and ______________ gas, with ___________________ reactivity down the group.

•	When reacted with water, fizzing and gas production indicate _____________________________ gas release, while phenolphthalein turning pink confirms the formation of a(n) acid/basic (circle one) solution.

•	Group 1 and 2 metals react with chlorine gas to form solid __________________ chlorides in _________________ (heat releasing) reactions, with ___________________ reactivity down the group.

•	Group 1 metals react less/more (circle one) vigorously than group 2 metals it is easier/harder (circle one) to lose a single valence electron than to lose two.

•	As atomic size increases down a group (more filled shells), valence electrons are held weakly/strongly (circle one), making them easier to lose and increasing metal reactivity.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COGNITIVE LEVEL: toLevel4 (Apply)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TARGET: Use knowledge in new situations.
TEST: Can student use procedures, concepts, or principles in unfamiliar contexts?
QUESTION TYPES: Predict outcomes, solve problems, apply procedures, use in scenarios.
STEMS: "What would happen if...", "In this situation, you would...", "Apply X to solve...", "Predict the result..."
REQUIRE: Novel scenarios not seen in teaching materials. Test transfer of learning.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can write electron configurations using comma notation
CODE: 2.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
Electron configuration notation lists the number of electrons in each shell, separated by commas. For example, chlorine with 17 electrons has the configuration 2,8,7.

WHY (importance):
This notation provides a quick way to communicate electron arrangement without drawing diagrams.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Potassium has 19 electrons. Its electron configuration is 2,8,8,1 showing electrons distributed across four shells.

SUBTOPIC: Electron Configuration
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers how electrons are arranged in shells around the nucleus. You will learn the rules for filling electron shells and how to represent electron arrangements using shell diagrams and electron configuration notation.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Electron configuration determines an element's chemical behaviour. Elements react to achieve stable, full outer shells, so knowing how electrons are arranged lets you predict how elements will bond and react.

TOPIC: The Periodic Table
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: Year 10
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Understanding how atomic structure and properties of elements are used to organise them in the periodic table, and how position predicts chemical behaviour.

Lesson 4: Family Groupings 1:
Metals and the Periodic Table
Taking Note

Why does the periodic table look like it does?
It is no accident that the elements in the periodic table are arranged as you see them in the periodic table below.

Let’s review
















	How many electrons are in the outer (valence) shell of 
	the group 1 metal?	____________________
	the group 2 metals?	____________________
	the group 17 halogens? 	____________________
	the group 18 noble gases?	____________________

	What is the link between group number and electron arrangement?  _________________________________________
	What is the link between period number and electron arrangement?  ________________________________________

All elements in the periodic table want to be a noble gas!
This means they want:
	to be _________________________________________
	to have _______________________________________
Metals and the Periodic Table
There are only 1 or 2 electrons in the valence shell (outer shell) of the atoms of most metals. 
Metals want to be __________________ and want to have a _______________ outer shell (2, 8) electrons like the stable _________________ gases.

They readily give away their electrons.
 
Complete the diagram below.
 

With _____________electrons in its outer shell, magnesium loses them to get the same electronic configuration of the noble gas ___________________ and is stable as a __________ ion. 

	Metals will be more reactive when _____________________________________________________________________.
	Electrons are held more weakly when they are ________________________________________________________.
	Hence, metallic elements with BIGGER atoms are MORE REACTIVE.

Predict the order, from LEAST reactive to MOST reactive in the

Practice what you know.
What do you need to remember about the metals in group 1 and 2 of the periodic table?
Complete the following summary tables.
	Softness	Reactivity
 	
The metals of group 1 and 2 become softer as you go down the group because the metallic bonding is stronger/weaker (circle one). 

This is because the valence electrons are closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.	
The metals of group 1 and 2 become
more reactive/less reactive (circle one) down the group.

This is because the valence electrons are closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.

Valence electrons that are further from the nucleus are given way 
more easily/less easily (circle one) and, hence, react more readily.

Halogens want to be __________________ and want to have _______________ valence shell (2, 8) electrons like the stable _________________ gases.

They readily accept electrons from other elements
 

Complete the diagram below.
 

With _____________electrons in its outer shell, fluorine gains electrons from other electrons to get the same electronic configuration of the noble gas ___________________ and is stable as a __________ ion. 

	Non-metals will be more reactive when the valence shell is ____________________________________

Use the data that you collected during Assessment Practical Part 1 (Virtual) to construct a graph of        Melting Point vs Atomic Number for each of the elements in groups 1, 2, 17 and 18 of the periodic table.       (5 marks)

Notes regarding the graph. 

•	Plot four graphs with four lines on one set of axes (pay attention to what your teacher tells you).
•	The graphs be hand drawn on the grid below.
•	Graphs should have a title, the axis labelled and a line of best fit.
 
Analysing the trends

Look at your graphs and complete the following summary statements by highlighting or circling the correct alternative.

a.	Melting point trend (2 marks)
Select the correct alternative, either increase or decrease. You can do this by highlighting the correct alternative or deleting the incorrect alternative.
Group 1	The melting point of the elements in group 1 increases/decreases down the group.
Group 2	The melting point of the elements in group 2 increases/decreases down the group.
Group 17	The melting point of the elements in group 17 increases/decreases down the group.
Group 18	The melting point of the elements in group 18 increases/decreases down the group.

b.	Using the Trends (6 marks)
Melting point is an excellent indicator of how strongly the particles in a substance are bonded together. 
In general: 
The higher the melting point,
the stronger the bonding holding the particles together in the substance.

Using this idea and the trends evident in the graphs that you produced to answer the following questions.
Does the bonding between metal atoms increase or decrease down a group? Use data to justify your answer.





Does the bonding between non-metal atoms increase or decrease down a group? Use data to justify your answer.





In general, would you consider the bonding between metal atoms to be stronger or weaker than the bonding between non-metal atoms? Use data to justify your answer.

Assessment Practical Part 3 
Patterns in the Periodic Table and Metal Reactivity

Name: _____________________________________________________________
	
It is no accident that certain elements have been arranged into the same group in the periodic table. Elements in the same group chemically react in the same way because they have the same number of electrons in the outer shell. 

Part 1 Demonstration of metals reacting with water
In this demonstration you will be observing the chemical reaction between some metals and water.
Record your observations by filling in the following table. (6 marks)

Common Reaction Pattern

The type of reaction taking place between a group 1 and 2 metals and water is always the same. 
These reactions can be described by word equations such as:

metal (solid) + water (liquid) → metal hydroxide (solution) + hydrogen (gas)

For example: 
lithium (solid) + water (liquid) → lithium hydroxide (solution) + hydrogen (gas)

1.	Complete the word equations for the other metals observed in this demonstration. (4 marks)

sodium (solid) + water (liquid)  →  


potassium (solid) + water (liquid)  →


magnesium (solid) + water (liquid)  →             


calcium (solid) + water (liquid)  →                 


Observations

2.	Considering the reactions that take place, what can the following observations be attributed to? Identify the key chemical that is evident by this observation. 

a.	Fizzing (2 marks)


b.	The phenolphthalein indicator turned from colorless to pink when the pH of the solutions becomes basic. (2 marks)


Different Reactivity

The main difference in these metals is how vigorously they reacted with the water.

3.	List the names of the group 1 metals from least reactive to most reactive. (1 mark)


Least reactive	   	               Most reactive





What do we see this pattern of reactivity in group 1 and group 2 metals?

Complete these sentences: (7 marks)

•	Group 1 and group 2 metals become more reactive as we go down a ______________________________. 

•	Group 1 metals have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	Group 2 metals have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	Elements are stable when they have ___________________ valence electron(s).

•	To become stable, group 1 elements easily lose 1 electron/gain 7 electrons (circle one).

•	To become stable, group 2 elements easily lose 2 electron/gain 6 electrons (circle one).


How easily elements can lose or gain electrons to become stable determines their reactivity. 

•	For group 1 and group 2, this depends on how close the negative/positive (circle one) valence electron is to the negative/positive (circle one) nucleus of the atom.

•	As we go down a group, the period number decrease/increase (circle one) and so does the number of filled electron _______________.

•	As the number of electrons shells increases, the valence electrons get closer to/further from (circle one) the nucleus.

•	The further from the nucleus, the less/more (circle one) strongly the negative valence electron is held to the positive nucleus and the easier/harder (circle one) it is lose electrons to become stable, and the less/more reactive the atom is.

4.	Use the sentences above to write a summary sentence explaining the relative reactivity of group 1 and group 2 elements as you go down a group (2 marks).






Part 2: Reaction with Chlorine gas

Group 1 and 2 metals react with chlorine gas to produce a metal chloride compound.  Like metals reacting with water, metals reacting with chlorine gas show different chemical reactivities.

Summary: (5 marks)

•	Group 1 and group 2 metals react with water to produce a _____________ hydroxide and ______________ gas, with ___________________ reactivity down the group.

•	When reacted with water, fizzing and gas production indicate _____________________________ gas release, while phenolphthalein turning pink confirms the formation of a(n) acid/basic (circle one) solution.

•	Group 1 and 2 metals react with chlorine gas to form solid __________________ chlorides in _________________ (heat releasing) reactions, with ___________________ reactivity down the group.

•	Group 1 metals react less/more (circle one) vigorously than group 2 metals it is easier/harder (circle one) to lose a single valence electron than to lose two.

•	As atomic size increases down a group (more filled shells), valence electrons are held weakly/strongly (circle one), making them easier to lose and increasing metal reactivity.

COGNITIVE LEVEL: toLevel5 (Analyze & Evaluate)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TARGET: Break down relationships, make judgments, assess validity.
TEST: Can student compare, contrast, infer, critique, or synthesise?
QUESTION TYPES: Compare/contrast, identify relationships, evaluate claims, infer from data, critique reasoning.
STEMS: "Which conclusion is supported by...", "Compare X and Y...", "The evidence suggests...", "Evaluate the claim that..."
REQUIRE: Multi-step reasoning. May include data, scenarios, or competing claims to evaluate.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
