        { "text": "Only aluminium would float because it is the lightest metal", "correct": false, "explanation": "All three metals have densities less than mercury's 13.5 g/cm³, so they all float on mercury." },

      "options": [
        { "text": "Yes, because its density is 0.9 g/cm³ which is close to but still below 1.0 g/cm³, so it floats", "correct": true },
        { "text": "No, because 0.9 g/cm³ is too close to 1.0 g/cm³ to predict", "correct": false, "explanation": "Any density less than 1.0 g/cm³ will cause floating; 0.9 is definitively less than 1.0." },

        { "text": "The explanation is correct because the sand is inside the bottle", "correct": false, "explanation": "Sand has a density of about 2.6 g/cm³; the bottle floats because the air inside lowers the overall density." },
        { "text": "The explanation is correct because sand floats on water", "correct": false, "explanation": "Sand grains individually sink in water; the bottle floats due to the air space reducing overall density." },

      "options": [
        { "text": "No; density tells us which floats and which sinks, but the rate depends on other factors like shape and viscosity", "correct": true },
