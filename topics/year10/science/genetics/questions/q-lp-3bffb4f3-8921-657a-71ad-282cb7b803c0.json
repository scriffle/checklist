            {
              "answer": "nucleus",
              "explanation": "Mitochondria do not have a nucleus. They have their own DNA, which is circular like bacterial DNA."

              "answer": "ribosome",
              "explanation": "While mitochondria do have ribosomes, the key evidence is their independent DNA, similar to bacteria."

          "correct": "double",

            {
              "answer": "single",
              "explanation": "Mitochondria have a double membrane, not single. This is key evidence for the engulfing event."

              "answer": "triple",
              "explanation": "Mitochondria have two membranes (double), not three. The double membrane supports endosymbiotic theory."
