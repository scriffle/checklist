      "correct": "Heterozygous carriers pass the recessive allele without showing symptoms, so the disorder appears in later generations when two carriers have children",
      "correctExplanation": "Recessive disorders require two copies; carriers (heterozygotes) are unaffected but can pass the allele on, making the disorder appear to skip the carrier generation.",

        {
          "answer": "The disorder allele disappears for a generation and then reappears through spontaneous mutation",

          "answer": "Dominant alleles weaken over generations until they can no longer mask the recessive trait",

          "answer": "The disorder skips generations because DNA degrades and repairs differently in each generation",
