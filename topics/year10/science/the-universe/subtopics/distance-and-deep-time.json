  "what": "This subtopic covers how astronomers measure distances to celestial objects using parallax and standard units like lightyears and parsecs. It also explores the concept that observing distant objects means looking back in time.",
  "why": "Understanding cosmic distances is fundamental to astronomy. Without accurate distance measurements, we cannot determine the true brightness of stars, the scale of the universe, or interpret what we observe in the night sky.",

      "what": "The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere with Earth at its centre, used to map the positions of stars and planets. Historically, people believed stars were physically attached to this sphere made of ether.",
      "why": "Understanding historical models helps us appreciate how scientific understanding evolves when evidence disproves earlier ideas, such as the Michelson-Morley experiment disproving ether.",
      "example": "Ancient astronomers used the celestial sphere to predict where planets would appear each night, believing all stars were the same distance from Earth on a physical sphere.",

      "title": "I can describe how parallax is used to measure distance",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Parallax measures distance by observing how an object appears to shift position when viewed from two different locations. Your two eyes use parallax to perceive depth.",
      "why": "Parallax provides a geometric method to calculate distances without physically travelling to an object, which is essential for measuring distances in space.",
      "example": "Hold your thumb at arm's length and close one eye, then the other. Your thumb appears to shift position against the background. The amount of shift relates to the distance.",

      "code": "1.3",
      "what": "Stellar parallax measures star distances by observing their apparent shift against distant background stars as Earth orbits the Sun over six months. It only works for relatively close stars.",
      "why": "Stellar parallax provides the foundation for measuring cosmic distances, but its limitation to nearby stars meant astronomers needed other methods for more distant objects.",
      "example": "The nearest star, Proxima Centauri at 4.2 lightyears, has a parallax angle of about 0.77 arcseconds. Stars beyond about 100 parsecs have angles too small to measure accurately.",

      "code": "1.4",
      "what": "A lightyear is the distance light travels in one year (about 9 trillion km). A parsec equals 3.26 lightyears. To convert parsecs to lightyears, multiply by 3.26.",
      "why": "Both units are used in astronomy for different purposes. Being able to convert between them allows you to interpret astronomical data from various sources.",
      "example": "The Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million lightyears away. To convert to parsecs: 2,500,000 ÷ 3.26 = approximately 766,000 parsecs (0.766 million parsecs).",

      "why": "Knowing these reference distances helps you understand the vast scale of the universe and provides context for interpreting astronomical information.",
      "example": "Mars is about 13 light-minutes away on average. A message sent from a Mars rover takes 13 minutes to reach Earth, and the reply takes another 13 minutes, totalling 26 minutes round trip.",

      "code": "1.6",
      "what": "Light travels at 300,000 km/s, so light from distant objects takes time to reach us. When we observe a star 100 lightyears away, we see it as it was 100 years ago.",
      "why": "This concept allows astronomers to study the history of the universe by observing objects at different distances, effectively seeing different eras of cosmic history.",
      "example": "Light from the Sun takes 8 minutes to reach Earth. If the Sun suddenly disappeared, we would not know for 8 minutes because the last light would still be travelling toward us.",
