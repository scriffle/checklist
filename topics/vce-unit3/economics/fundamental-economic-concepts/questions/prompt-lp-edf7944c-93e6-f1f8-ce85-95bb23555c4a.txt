TITLE: I can define price elasticity of supply and identify the factors that affect it
CODE: 4.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
Price elasticity of supply (PES) measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price. Key factors affecting PES are: spare capacity (more spare capacity means more elastic), the production period (longer production times mean less elastic), and the durability or storability of the good (storable goods are more elastic as existing stock can be released).

WHY (importance):
PES determines how quickly and fully producers can respond to price changes. This affects how much of a tax is passed on to consumers, how quickly shortages are resolved, and how volatile prices are in different markets.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
The supply of fresh strawberries is inelastic in the short run because farmers cannot instantly grow more crops, even if prices spike. However, the supply of manufactured furniture is more elastic because factories with spare capacity can increase production relatively quickly by running extra shifts.

SUBTOPIC: Price Elasticity of Demand and Supply
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the meaning, measurement, and significance of price elasticity of demand (PED) and price elasticity of supply (PES). It explores the factors that determine whether demand or supply is elastic or inelastic and the implications for producers and policy-makers.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Elasticity determines how much quantity responds to a price change, which has direct implications for business revenue, the effectiveness of government taxes and subsidies, and the speed at which markets adjust. It is a tool that turns basic demand and supply analysis into something far more precise and useful.

Wants Needs Resources/ Factors of Production Mixed Economy Utility
Consumer Sovereignty – It is the ability of the consumer in a competitive market economy to direct or allocate
resources. Producers acting in their own self-interest use their scarce resources to produce what consumers demand
due to the extra dollars they can earn. Higher relative prices act as an incentive for producers to shift their resources
to the production of these goods and services due to higher profits.
i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. ix. Chapter 1 – Fundamental Economic Concepts
A definition of economic and economic activity – Economic activity is the volume (or real value) of production,
employment, incomes and expenditure in an economy
The basic economic problem – All wants and needs are infinite while resources (Land, labour and capital) are finite –
This requires individuals/ businesses and governments to make choices about how to allocate their scarce resources
All resources have competing uses – Labour can be dedicated towards manufacturing, service industries etc
Economics is about how resources are allocated among competing uses - Our resources land labour and capital are finite
or limited and can be used in a range of different ways. For example water is a land resource that can be used for a range
of competing uses including drinking, watering plants, cleaning agriculture etc. As a society we must make choices as to
how we will utilise our scarce resources to maximise living standards this is the goal of an economy.
An efficient allocation of resources is one where societies living standards are maximised, resources
are devoted to areas that will maximise utility and opportunity cost is minimised – Include
opportunity cost in your definition
The four factors of production are land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship and all have competing uses (You need
to be able to explain what these competing uses are – E.g. Labour can be used in various ways. You could become a
teacher, plumber, engineer or lawyer, however, because your time is scarce you need to make choices)
Remember to be considered a factor of production the resource must be used to make goods and services for sale. A
car is not a factor of production if it is simply being used by consumers, however a taxi or a pizza delivery car is being
used to provide a service so it would be considered a factor of production
The three economic questions are what, how and for whom to produce – Australia is a market capitalist economy and
will dedicate resources to areas that are the most profitable using the combination of land and labour that is most
efficient and profitable (Consumer sovereignty mainly dictates how resources are allocated with some government
intervention)
The government intervenes because a private market based on the profit motive would lead to a highly uneven
distribution of resources (Only those with particular skills or land would generate high incomes)
7
x. xi. xii. xiii. xiv. xv. xvi. xvii. xviii. xix. Because resources are scarce and have alternative uses economic actors must make choices. Every choice involves an
opportunity costs (The value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made)
Opportunity costs can be measures in dollars, time or external costs passed on to others
The PPF represents the production possibilities available to an economy producing 2 goods and services. Every point
on the PPF is technically efficient, points inside the PPF symbolise and inefficient allocation or resources (E.G. Idle
labour or capital) while points outside the curve are unobtainable at the current point in time
The PPF is bowed outwards because resources are not equally suited to both types of production and therefore the
opportunity cost increases the more of a good or service that is produced
The PPF is downward sloping because every decision requires a trade-off in terms of the other goods
or service (The opportunity cost)
The PPF will shift inwards if there is a fall in the quantity or quality of productive resources available to an economy
(E.g. A cyclone, drought, emigration etc.), the PPF will shift outwards if there is an increase in the quality or quantity
of resources available to an economy (E.g. Increased immigration, new technology, exploration of natural resources,
foreign investment)
The allocatively efficient point on a PPF is dependent on how much society values different goods and services
(Generally only 1 point on the PPF), dynamic efficiency is about how quickly we can shift resources towards the
allocatively efficient point
We assume all economic actors are rational, have preferences, are subject to budget constraints and think at the
margin
Rational economic actors think at the margin. They way up the net benefits and net costs of any decision and make
decisions based on the net benefits exceeding net cost
The law of diminishing marginal utility states that the more of a good or service that is consumed per period the
smaller the increase in utility that is generated from each additional unit.
Productive Capacity– The point at which production (or GDP) is occurring at the maximum level possible in an
economy (The physical limits of production). The economy is at its physical limit or potential to produce goods and
services and resources are being used to maximum efficiency. Boosting a countries productive capacity over time is
critical to boosting material living standards.
Types of Efficiency
An efficient allocation of resources occurs when the needs and wants of society are maximised. The goods and services that
people want will be produced in the best possible way (waste will be minimised and there is no better way to make the product).
When efficiency is achieved it will be impossible to make someone better off without making someone else worse off, the
opportunity cost is minimised and the goods and services that are produced provide the highest level of collective satisfaction
i. Productive/ technical efficiency- Maximising output per unit of input, achieving the least cost method of
production and minimising the use of resources in production. Obtaining the greatest possible production of goods
and services from available resources (Land, capital and labour used to their full potential). Resources are not wasted
in the production process and an economy is producing the best quality product at the lowest opportunity cost.
ii. Allocative efficiency- ensuring the most efficient allocation of scarce resources in an economy in a sense that
resources are producing the goods and services most valued by society and living standards/ welfare is being
maximized. It is represented by only one point on the PPF. Allocative efficiency is about maximizing technical
efficiency whilst also producing what consumers desire (In both the short and long term). When allocative efficiency
occurs no resources will be wasted and it will be impossible to make someone better off without making someone else
worse off. Any change in the way our resources are allocated will reduce national welfare or living standards.
iii. Dynamic efficiency– Refers to how quickly an economy can reallocate resources to achieve allocative efficiency.
Relates to firms being creative and innovative, adapting to latest technology and upgrading workers skills in response
to changing economic conditions. Is it achieved when businesses can adapt their methods of production and output
quickly in response to changes in market conditions or changes in technology (E.g. from point 1 to point 2)
iv. Inter-temporal efficiency- Achieved when an ideal balance is met between using resources (Firms, gov
’t or
nation) to satisfy needs and wants today but conserving resources for the future also. A balance between resource use
for current use and that of future generations.

How could two countries have different allocatively
efficient points on the PPF (Assuming they are
producing the same two goods and services?
Why does improving technical
efficiency help an economy achieve
allocative efficiency?
Assume an economy is achieving technical efficiency. Explain
with the use of an example how it could achieve a more efficient
allocation of resources without pushing out the PPC
- Define allocative efficiency (Maximising
societies welfare/ wants and needs)
- They may value goods differently
Provide an example
- Define technical efficiency
- Help keeps prices low (Production costs
are lower) so consumers have more
purchasing power (Can meet more of
their wants and needs)
- More goods and services available/
choice
- No idle resources/ unemployment
(Higher incomes)
- Define technical efficiency
- State that higher productivity means higher quantity/ volume of
goods and services
- Also means lower prices if markets are competitive increasing
purchasing power – Higher MLS improving Allocative efficiency
- However technical does not imply we are producing what society
values – Could be producing items nobody wants or those that reduce
living standards
- Provide an example
How can the government and businesses promote technical efficiency within the
economy? E.g. What could they do to make businesses more productive?
Government
- Remove unfair dismissal laws, tax concessions for research and development into new
technology (Businesses pay less tax if they invest)
- Build new infrastructure (New roads), lower tariffs, subsidise training programs
Businesses -Invest in capital and machinery, training, performance based pay
How can the government help
ensure inter-temporal
efficiency?
- Define inter-temporal
efficiency
- Carbon tax
- Subsidising clean energy
- Tax concessions for savings
and investment
What are some ways the gov’t can promote
allocative efficiency
- Lower tariffs
- Taxes on cigarettes/ alcohol
- Banning certain products
- Subsidising health care/ education
(Goods with positive externalities)
How can the government and businesses help increase dynamic
efficiency in the economy?
i. Lower tariffs – So we shift resources to areas of comparative advantage
ii. Multiskilling employees – So they shift labour to areas of high demand
quickly
iii. Removing unfair dismissal laws – So they can sack workers when
preferences change
iv. Deregulating the labour market – Pay based on profitability?
v. Technological advances
vi. Investing in alternative energy
vii. Removing subsidies in uncompetitive industries
How does improving
inter-temporal efficiency help
allocative efficiency
- Preserves living standards/ welfare
for future generations
Provide an example
- Research and development into
new green energy (Less floods etc.)
- Savings are needed for future
investment
- Reducing our level of NFD (Helps
to keep taxes low, interest low in
the future)
Explain why dynamic efficiency is needed to
improve allocative efficiency.
Why dynamic efficiency is important – Because it allows us
to quickly shift resources to where they are demanded
ensuring societies welfare/ living standards are increased
(Higher production of goods/ services in demand) increasing
Allocative efficiency
Example – Mining industry and shift in resources – Higher
wages/ income due to strong overseas demand (Consumer
sovereignty), faster we get resources into mining the better
for the economy – Achieve allocative efficiency
This is why market economies are good at achieving
allocative efficiency for the most part – Due to consumer
sovereignty

Really important definition:
Disposable income – The rewards received by households from their contribution to the production process (income
from working plus income from other productive resources) plus government transfers (for example, pensions and
parenting payments) minus direct taxes (i.e. income tax). It represents the total amount that consumers have to spend on
goods and services.
Chapter 2 notes
Features of perfectly competitive markets:
i. A large number of buyers and sellers with each of them having little influence on price (Sellers are Price takers). No
individual buyer or seller has the market power to influence price
ii. Products are homogenous which means they are virtually identical and easily substitutable. This means that suppliers
who offer products at the lower price will attract customers (There is no branding or product differentiation
distinguishing products)
iii. There is ease of entry and exit into the market. There are low set up costs in the industry which means if there are
profit making opportunities available new competitors can quickly enter the market and undercut existing suppliers.
This means ‘Abnormal or supernormal Profits,
’ cannot be made in the long term (Only normal profits).
Other assumptions of perfectly competitive markets:
i. Resources are mobile and can be moved quickly from one market to another which allows price signals to do their job -
Consumer sovereignty dictates where resources are allocated (High demand for products send signals to producers to
produce certain goods and services)
ii. Perfect information (Full information) in that both the buyer and seller know all the information about the product
being sold and other alternatives available in the market. They can compare prices and make rational/ informed
decisions (There is no asymmetric information which can lead to inefficiency).
iii. Both the buyer and seller seek to maximise their own wellbeing, sellers aim to maximise their profits and the
purchaser aims to maximise their utility or satisfaction
Other key information
i. Market or Price Mechanism – Describes how the forces of demand and supply interact to determine (relative)
prices of goods and services in different markets and ultimately how our productive resources are allocated in the
economy
ii. Consumer sovereignty dictates where resources are allocated in Australia’s market capitalist economy. Profit
motivated businesses will shift resources to areas in high demand as they are the most profitable ‘The invisible hand
of the market.
’
10
iii. Changes in relative prices act as signals to producers to direct resources (Land, labour, capital) to these areas of high
demand
iv. Know the law of demand and law of supply really well – The law of demand states the higher the price of a good or
service the smaller the quantity demanded and vice versa
v. Know the reasons the demand curve slopes downwards (Income effect, substitute effect, law of
diminishing marginal utility – At higher prices consumers will buy less of a good or service)
vi. The key microeconomic demand side factors – Disposable income, consumer preferences/tastes,
price of complements, price of substitutes, population, consumer sentiment, interest rates,
demographic changes and advertising
vii. The difference between normal and inferior goods – There is a decreased demand for inferior goods when consumers
disposable incomes rise
viii. Know the reasons the supply curve slopes upwards – Greater profits available at higher prices, increased opportunity
cost associated with shifting resources to other areas, firms are able to more effectively cover the marginal costs
associated with additional production
ix. The key microeconomic supply side factors – Change in capital costs, changes in the cost of
machinery, productivity, improvements in technology, changes in labour costs, changes to
government laws and regulations (Including indirect taxes), climatic conditions, subsidies, the price
of other products using similar resources
x. How a market gets back to equilibrium if the initial price is set too high or too low – The impact of price ceilings
(Causing shortages) and price floors (Causing surpluses) on markets
xi. Shifting the curves – Remember for a shift in demand to occur consumers must be more or less
willing to demand a good at any given price. For a shift in supply to occur producers must be more or
less willing/ able to supply at any given price
xii. Practice getting a market back to equilibrium after a shift in supply or demand and after a double shift in supply and
demand. Mention the initial shortage/ surplus, the change in price, the contraction and expansions and the new
equilibrium point.
xiii.Also mention the value of any shortages and the initial and new equilibrium price if you are given
figures in a graph
xiv. How each shift will impact the price and quantity demanded of a product
Shift in curve New Equilibrium Price New Equilibrium Quantity
Demand Shifts Right Demand shifts left Higher price Lower Price Higher Quantity
Lower quantity
Supply shifts right Lower price Higher quantity
Supply shifts left Higher price Lower quantity
xv. xvi. Some factors that will shift both curves – Changes in oil prices for cars, advertising, changes in interest rates, changes
in the value of the AUD
Remember any excise/ indirect taxes shift supply left not demand left
xvii. Tricky table – Be really careful about what causes a shift vs. a contraction or expansion in
demand and supply
A shift in the demand curve to
the right causes
Impact on demand A contraction in demand - due to the
higher price

11
xviii. A PED of less than 1 means that demand is inelastic (Elasticity measures the responsiveness of demand to a change
in price)
xix. Revise what is meant by elastic and inelastic demand curves and the fact that a lower price will boost revenue if a
good is ELASTIC and vice versa
xx. Revise the factors that impact elasticity of demand – Degree of necessity, number of substitutes,
time, cost and relative importance (Percentage of income), minor complementary product
xxi. The price of petrol fell significantly in 2015. With reference to the concept of elasticity explain the
impact lower petrol prices are likely to have on household budgets in 2015
Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the percentage change in quantity demanded resulting from a given
percentage change in price. Petrol is generally associated with a low PED because petrol is deemed by consumers and
households to be a necessity with few substitutes.
Lower prices for petrol will not generally result in consumers choosing to drive their car further or more frequently
(because demand is price inelastic), so the total amount spent on petrol is likely to fall. Therefore, lower prices will free up
more of the weekly household budget for savings or other discretionary purchasing decisions, possibly improving the
material living standards of Australian households.
xxii. Revise the factors that impact elasticity of supply – Storability/ perishability, spare capacity/
resource mobility, time
xxiii. Remember that even if a good is INELASTIC the quantity demanded will still change when the price changes – The
proportional change in price will just be greater than the proportional change in demand
xxiv. Spend lots of time on relative prices – Relative prices refer to the price of one good or service in terms of the price
of another good or service
xxv. Key words – Forces of demand and supply, profit motive, price signals, consumer sovereignty,
resources (Land, labour and capital)
xxvi. ALL RELATIVE PRICE ANSWERS MUST USE EXAMPLES TO SHOW HOW RESOURCES SHIFT!
xxvii. Factors causing a change in relative prices – Advertising, fashion tastes, unfavourable supply side conditions, taxes,
demographic changes, tariffs, government assistance (Subsidies)
xxviii. Remember producers will shift resources to areas where there is higher relative profits not higher
relative prices – If higher prices are caused by poor supply side conditions resources will move out
of that industry
xxix. Use the mining boom to show how resources shift from one industry to another in response to
changing prices - More resources were allocated to expanding existing mines and building new mines (Capital
resources reallocated to mining and away from other forms of investment) – Capital reallocated. It also lead to the
reallocation of labour to the mining sector (Builders, surveyors, engineers, truck drivers. IT specialists quickly
applied for jobs and moved to W.A.)
xxx. Relative prices determine how to produce – Producers will use the combination of land and capital that is most cost
effective
xxxi. For whom to produce is determined by people’s relative wages determining their access to goods and services
From CPAP Study Guide: Examples of factors changing relative prices (VOD) Streaming of Content
Consumer tastes and preferences:
Another example of the impact of changing consumer tastes and preferences is in the rapidly growing preference for
video-on-demand (VOD) streaming of content. VOD means that viewers can watch a variety of TV programmes, as
well as subscription services and other digital content online.
This includes catch-up TV services such as iView and SBS on Demand. All of the free-to-air TV stations have a
downloadable app, so that viewers can watch content on many types of devices –including computers, tablets and
smartphones.
12
Changing consumer tastes and preferences have contributed to this shift in demand – people want to watch what
they want, when they want it and how they want it.
The Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) reported that in the six months to June 2016, 63% of
adult Australians had content online.
Furthermore, as of July 2016, there were 2.7 million paid SVOD subscriptions in Australia. This means that 2.7
million subscribers joined subscription video services within two years of the launch of such services in Australia.
In fact, 32% of Australians watch SVOD content. Subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix, Stan and
Presto are also relatively low cost, compared to average incomes. For example, a subscriber can access each service’s
whole catalogue of TV and films for $10 a month.
What have these changed consumer preferences meant for entertainment markets in Australia?
As a consequence of changing preferences, there has been a gradual decline in free-to-air TV viewing, and particularly at
the time of broadcast.
As keen students of economics, you will be aware that resources have been reallocated into those markets where
consumers have shown increased preference (demand) for products.
Traffic to iView doubles roughly every 18 months, and the service continues to command an ever growing proportion of
the ABC budget to keep it up and running.
On the other hand, forecasts from ACMA indicate that SVOD paid subscribers will overtake the number of Foxtel
subscribers by 2019, as Foxtel is a relatively more expensive option. (In order to compete, Foxtel has also been forced to
offer a simpler version of its service- Foxtel Play – with subscriptions starting at $10 month.)
The increasing popularity of SVOD services has also seen the end of other Australian online video-on-demand services.
Quickflix went into administration in early 2016, following on from the closure of locally owned on-demand service
EzyFlix in August 2015.
The ready and cheap availability of complementary products- such as unlimited data packages from telecommunications
providers – has also driven demand for SVOD services.
In addition, the devices required to access SVOD services – computers, mobile devices, Apple TVs, Google’s Chromecast,
and Smart TVs – have all been falling in price.

The nature of and conditions for a perfectly competitive market
There are very few markets in Australia that meet the preconditions for being a perfectly competitive market – namely,
the market has a large number of buyers and sellers such that no buyer or seller has the power to influence price, the
products being sold are largely identical and easy to substitute for each other (homogenous), and it is easy to enter and
leave the market when profit opportunities exist, because there are low set up costs.
Reasons the introduction of Uber makes the ride sharing industry closer to perfect competition:
Until the arrival of the ride sharing service, UberX in April 2014, the market for point-to-point passenger travel (the
taxi market) showed characteristics of a monopoly or duopoly– a very small number of providers dominated the
market.
In Victoria, that was 13Cabs and Silvertop Taxis. To provide services, a driver would have to purchase a taxi license
(which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each) and register with one of the two taxi companies. Fares (prices)
were largely unresponsive to demand.
As mentioned earlier, UberX is a ridesharing service using a mobile application that connects passengers to willing
private drivers. It provides a service similar to a taxi.
The Uber Corporation provides the app and overseas the services, but ultimately the drivers are working for
themselves. This type of service is often referred to as ‘point-to-point’ passenger travel.
The arrival of UberX has transformed the market for point-to-point passenger travel – and had the effect of increasing
the level of competition in the market, such that it now more closely resembles perfect competition.
Reasons the market now resembles perfect competition
i. Low barriers to entry:
Drivers can register with UberX without significant barriers to entry. They must possess a valid driver’s licence and a
registered, roadworthy vehicle, and pass a basic background check, but generally the set-up costs are relatively low,
and hence the barriers to entry (and exit) in the market have been reduced.
ii. Lots of buyers and sellers and increased homogeneity
The arrival of Uber on the global market has led to the emergence of other ride sharing platforms – including Lyft,
DiDi Kuaidi (China’s largest lift sharing service) and Ingog
These services have begun to imitate each other, such that increasingly the product being offered is becoming more
homogenous.
In addition, as the product offered by ride sharing services becomes similar, the companies are increasingly competing
on price - bidding each other’s prices down – just as we would expect in a more competitive market.
17
As the popularity and profile of UberX has increased in Australia, larger and larger number of individuals have signed
up to offer their service as Uber drivers and more and more consumers have become UberX customers.
Figures from an Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal survey in February 2015 found around one in 10
Sydneysiders had used ride-sharing services. This has meant the market further replicates another condition of perfect
competition – a large number of buyers and sellers.
iii.Perfect information
A rating system for drivers and riders (passengers) of UberX has contributed to transparency in the market, and
improved the level of information for both participants in the transaction.
In economics, we refer to this as reducing the information asymmetries in the market, or increasing the degree to
which ‘perfect information’ exists in the market.
Once again, this has helped both consumers (passengers) and producers (drivers) to make more efficient decisions and
results in a more competitive market.
iv.Surge pricing (Demand and supply determine prices)
One further key feature of ride sharing services which replicates the predicted conditions and consequences of a
perfectly competitive market is the use of ‘surge pricing.
’
During periods of peak demand, the prices for rides charged by Uber increase substantially. For example, prior to New
Year’s Eve 2016, Uber warned that there would be an increase in prices of its services.
As an Uber spokesperson said at the time ‘During times of peak demand - on New Year’s Eve that’s around between
midnight and 3am, fares increase via an algorithm to help ensure a driver is always nearby and you can get a ride if you
need one.
’
According to economic theory this should work – an increase in the price of a product will lead to an increase in supply
of that product, without any other changes in supply conditions for the product. On a D/S diagram, this would be
represented by an expansion along the existing supply curve.
Competitive Markets and Efficiency
i. Market structures refers to the way particular industries are structured/ organised in terms of the number of firms,
degree of competition, level of efficiency and ease of entry and exit into the market etc.
ii. Perfect competition – Many buyers and sellers with perfect information meaning firms are price takers, homogenous
products (Explain what this means), firms can enter and exit the market freely (No large exit fees), licences or set up
costs, all buyers and sellers have perfect information and all resources are mobile
iii. If a perfectly competitive market is making abnormal profits new competitors enter the market and force prices down
until firms only make normal profits (This may not be the case with oligopolies
iv. Perfect markets are generally the most efficient because
- Resources will be allocated to areas of societies best interest (Consumer sovereignty) in the right quantities (No body
has the power to restrict supply – Allocative efficiency), competition ensure businesses strive to be as technically
efficient as possible to stay competitive
- Businesses must invest in new technology and better production techniques to remain competitive), factor mobility
ensures dynamic and allocative efficiency, suppliers need to pay close attention to price signals or you can become
uncompetitive
v. More concentrated markets like monopolies are less efficient because
- A lack of competition amongst suppliers can lead to businesses abusing their power and charging excessive prices
(Price makers), producers can restrict output leading to under allocation of resources to certain areas valued by society
(Less allocative efficiency, decreasing NMLS)
- Consumers have little choice but to buy the product from them leading to reduced allocative efficiency– May not use
the best production techniques or inputs as there is less pressure to cut costs (Technical efficiency).
18
Competitive markets and efficiency
Key features (Must be explained in detail)– Many buyers and sellers (Price takers), homogenous products, ease of entry and exit, perfect information, mobile resources, buyers and
sellers are rational and aim to maximise their well-being, consumer sovereignty dictates resource allocation and only normal profits are made
Competitive markets and allocative efficiency
Competitive markets and technical efficiency
Definition - The combination of goods and services (Produced and consumed)
which achieves the highest level of collective satisfaction for a society.
Definition- Technical efficiency is the effectiveness with which a given set of inputs is used to produce an
output. A firm is said to be technically efficient if a firm is producing the maximum output from the
minimum quantity of inputs, such as labour, capital and technology.
Reasons free markets promote allocative efficiency
Reasons free markets promote technical efficiency
i. Producers pay close attention to price signals and therefore meet
consumers demand – Shortage, increased prices, higher profits etc.
There is a discipline to seek the least cost method of production (Because products are very
similar and only competing on price)
ii. Production is not constrained when there is high demand (No
barriers to entry) so they produce enough and meet demand
ii. Great incentive to keep expenses down and reduce waste
Prices are lower due to competition and incentive to invest in better
production techniques, minimise waste and boost productivity
(Increased MLS)
Firms are always looking for better production techniques, better management practices and
ways to more effectively utilise technology
Improving productivity means existing resources can achieve high production volumes
Factor mobility ensure resources are quickly switched to meet
consumer’s needs (Dynamic efficiency)
This boosts allocative efficiency as products are cheaper and consumers have more choice
(Maximising welfare)
iii. iv. i. iii. iv. v. Competitive markets and dynamic efficiency
Dynamic efficiency– The ability of an economic system to move to a new allocatively
efficient point following a change in conditions of demand and/or supply. How quickly the
market responds to changes in relative prices by reallocating resources into the now relatively
more profitable (More desired) areas of production.
Reasons free markets promote dynamic efficiency
i. In competitive markets the movement to the new equilibrium prices happens quickly.
ii. Suppliers constantly monitor price changes to maximise their profits and move
resources as quickly as possible to areas of production that are the most profitable.
iii. Resources are mobile and can be substituted into different areas of production because
of low set up costs making it easier to shift resources into profitable areas.
iv. Demand will often be met because new competitors will enter the market as the relative
price of a product increases (Unlike in some other markets where it can be difficult for
new companies to enter the market).
v. Firms will constantly change the types of products they produce if it is in their best
interest/ if it’s profitable.
Competitive markets and inter-temporal efficiency
Definition- Achieving a balance between current and future levels of societal satisfaction. If
we achieving inter-temporal efficiency the living standards of future generations should not be
jeopardised by the current generation.
Pro’s and con’s of free markets for inter-temporal efficiency
Pro - If there is excessive spending and not enough saving the ‘Money market’ may
experience a shortage of funds for investment (Not enough money for borrowing).
Demand for funds will outweigh supply leading to a shortage and increased interest rates
helping to rebalance the level of spending in the economy (Encouraging savings and
discouraging spending due to the higher opportunity cost associated with spending).
Con – Essential infrastructure can be neglected
Con – People value the present more than the future leading to sustainability issues. Relative
prices don’t always reflect the true costs and benefits of products.
Products with ‘Negative externalities’ like coal based electricity may be overproduced if they
are more profitable for firms causing climate change (Harming future generations)
19
i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. Market Failure
Definition of market failure - When the unregulated market is unable to allocate resources to maximise welfare or living
standards of society. When the price system, self-interest and consumer sovereignty are unsuccessful or inefficient in directing
resources into areas that promote the public interest (Allocative efficiency not achieved – Net benefits not maximised)
Four types of market failure you need to be aware of – Externalities (Positive and negative), public goods, asymmetric
information and common access resources
You also need to be aware of how the government intervenes to prevent or limit the impact of each of the 4 market failures
Characteristics of public goods (Non-excludable and non-rivalrous), why public goods and under allocated in a free market
(The free rider effect), examples, the Government solution to the inefficient allocation is to provide the public good at
approximately the level that the population values it with taxpayers money.
Definitions of both positive and negative externalities - Externalities arise when a person is engaged in a transaction (or
activity) that affects the wellbeing of a third party who is not involved in the transaction or activity.
They can be positive or negative and can occur in production or consumption. Producers and consumers often ignore these
third party externalities leading to an inefficient market
Externalities create a divergence between the private and social costs or benefits of production. Social cost includes all the
costs of production and the third party (external) costs arising, for example, from pollution of the atmosphere.

ix. x. xi. xii. xiii. xiv. xv. xvi. How the government intervene to prevent negative externalities - Governments use their power to regulate the market and
use taxes to affect relative prices – Taxes aim is to force the producer or consumer to internalise (pay for) the external cost
that has been imposed on a third party (Make private cost = social cost. Higher prices will generally decrease demand, shift
demand to substitutes that have smaller external costs
Other ways to prevent negative externalities – Age identification, licences, laws, government inspectors
Positive externalities - This occurs when the consumption or production of a good causes a benefit to a third party. In free
markets producers often under-allocate resources to areas where there are positive third party externalities
Merit Goods: Some goods and services are highly desirable. It is felt that all people should have access to them, and as such
even though they are provided by the free market the total level of demand is not satisfied E.g. Schools, Hospitals, Libraries
The government can help provide merit goods like education via – Subsidies, direct production, research
grants, minimum school leaving ages, legislation to ensure sufficient resources are allocated to these areas
Asymmetric information occurs when one party to a transaction has more information about the good or service (Occurs
when a consumer or supplier cannot gain full information about a product) leading to an inefficient allocation of resources-
It can lead to adverse selection and moral hazard
Hidden action is when one person in a transaction can act in a way that cannot be observed by the other party. Hidden
Characteristics occur when one side of the market knows more than the other about the product’s characteristics that are
relevant to the transaction.
Adverse selection occurs when one party knows more about the product than the other does. Thus the uninformed party may
therefore purchase adversely, resulting in an over or under allocation of resources to the production of that good or service. It
happens in the used car market and can lead to an over-allocation of resources to poor second hand cars and
under-allocation of resources to quality second hand cars
20
xvii. xviii. xix. i. Moral hazard is when economic agents adjust their behaviour to one that is less efficient from society
’s point of view due to
unobservable actions.
E.g. Health Insurance, Drivers, Workers, Banks. It leads to a change in incentives and a decrease in the efficiency of resource
allocation. It can also lead to safe drivers having to pay more for car insurance that they should because insurance companies
need to cover the extra claims of unsafe drivers, driving recklessly because they have insurance.
The private sector can help prevent asymmetric information via screening and signalling, independent reviews using the
internet and removing unfair dismissal laws (Preventing the principal agent problem)
The government can help prevent asymmetric information via - Trade practices legislation (Consumer
Law) preventing misleading and deceptive conduct ($250,000 fine), laws relating to warranties and
defective products, product disclosures and employment and contract laws that provide protection to
employers and employees that may face principal/agent problems (6 month trial periods, individual
contracts, removal of unfair dismissal laws)
Government Failure
Government failure occurs when governments intervene in the free operation of markets and in doing so cause inefficiencies,
reducing the satisfaction of society
’s needs and wants and lowering living standards. They make mistakes and reduce competition
Identify what is meant by the term government failure and explain one example of how government
intervention in the market can unintentionally lead to a less efficient allocation of resources (4 marks)
MINIMUM WAGES
Government failure is a situation where government intervention fails to improve the allocation of resources or actually
makes the allocation of resources less efficient compared to the free market outcome. Gov
’t failure can arise because it was
unnecessary for the gov
’t to intervene and their actions have led to a distortion of the price mechanism unnecessarily to alter
the allocation of resources in such a manner that it has reduced society
’s overall satisfaction
An efficient allocation of resources in the economy requires that all resources (e.g. labour and capital) are used in
combinations and applications such that national welfare is at a maximum.
The minimum wage is designed to protect workers with weak bargaining power from exploitation in the workforce. It is a
safety net so those on the minimum wage are above the poverty line and can afford basic goods and services.
The minimum wage however, can lead to undesirable consequences including the fact that many markets will not be in
equilibrium. When the minimum wage is set above the market clearing wage labour supply is greater than labour demand
which leads to unemployment in many industries. This is an inefficient allocation of resources as valuable labour is not being
utilised in the production process. This will lead to a country working inside its PPF and the maximum volume of production
and satisfaction cannot be achieved (Reducing technical and allocative efficiency).
Higher minimum wages can also reduce the gap between wages in high and low skilled professions covered by the minimum
wage which can lead to relative wages not being reflective of market conditions. This could potentially cause an under
allocation of scarce labour resources to certain profession because the relatively higher wage does not justify the extra
training or effort. This could lead to a more uneducated workforce and a drop in technical efficiency.
SUBSIDIES AND PROTECTIONISM
A government subsidy can unintentionally penalise other producers for a number of reasons. For example, the subsidy to
Alcoa enables it to bid up the price of resources such as labour and other inputs, which effectively increases the costs of
production for other producers. In addition, to the extent that the subsidies force governments [both state and federal] to
raise (business) taxes in order to fund the subsidy, it once more leads to an increase in the costs of production for other
businesses.
An efficient allocation of resources in the economy requires that all resources (e.g. labour and capital) are used in
combinations and applications such that national welfare is at a maximum. If subsidies are not specifically used to rectify a
market failure (e.g. to promote the production of goods or services with positive externalities in production or consumption)
then they can lead to a less efficient allocation of resources.
In the case of subsidies in general, they have typically led to a less efficient allocation of resources, by diverting resources
away from those industries or activities in which Australia has a comparative advantage (e.g. tourism and education) and
towards those industries (e.g. manufacturing) in which Australia is relatively less [technically] efficient. Like protection more
generally, subsidies worked to protect local firms from the rigours of international competition and allowed many relatively
‘inefficient’ businesses to remain viable. As highlighted in the first paragraph, this penalised other producers, raising their
costs of production and prices, which ultimately led to a misallocation of the nation’s resources and a reduction in economic
(allocative) efficiency.
21
Positive and Negative externalities Most of the information on positive and negative
externalities is above
It is important that you clearly state that the private and
social costs or benefits differ in transactions with
positive or negative externalities
Education is a key positive externality in consumption –
The third party benefits include a more productive
workforce, lower unemployment rates (Helping the
gov’t), lower crime rates, better health outcomes,
increased taxes.
There is an under allocation of resources to education
because consumers don’t receive all these benefits and
in a free market the private cost may outweigh the
private benefit (Even if the social benefit exceeds the
private cost)
Gov’t intervenes – Minimum school leaving age,
subsidising private schools, providing public schools
free of charge to internalise the social benefits
Government intervention
Government regulation
- Laws banning certain activities and making others
mandatory (E.g. Bike helmets), compulsory
education (Shifting demand right), No Jab No Pay
for vaccinations (Stripping childcare subsidies for
those who don’t vaccinate their children)
Advertising (Very important) – Shifts demand
right for pos. externalities and left for neg. ext.
- Programs on healthy eating and staying active to
reduce the number of days lost to sickness and boost
productivity and boosting allocative efficiency,
promotion of cancer screening, Flight Flu campaign,
SunSmart
- QUIT campaigns, black balloon climate change adds
Subsidies for education (HECS help) and R and
D, indirect taxation
Types of Market Failure and government intervention
Asymmetric information
Sometimes the producers or consumer does not possesses full information about a good or service which can lead to a less efficient
allocation of resources
Asymmetric information– A market transaction when one party has access to more information than the other
Seller has more information than buyer – Lemon cars, fake jewellery
Leads to adverse selection– Individuals buys a faulty car (Hurting their welfare – Less allocatively efficient)
- Those with second hand cars hold on to their cars longer than they should because they know they won’t get a fair price for them
- Reputable sellers cannot get a fair price for their second hand car because consumers become more cautious about buying second
hand cars
- Not enough resources are allocated towards good second hand cars
Other situations– Dentists overcharging or undertaking unnecessary procedures to make more money reducing consumers material
living standards and their ability to purchase other goods and services, mechanics over-charging leading to significant transactions costs
as people search for fair/ reasonable mechanics
Buyer has more information than seller
Insurance contracts. Low risk customers effectively subsidise high risk customers
Moral hazard – Consumers change their behaviour in a way that is less efficient for society as the costs are transferred to other parties
- Some healthy citizens or safe drivers don’t get insurance as it is too expensive leading to an under allocation to insurance
services
- Another example is an employment contract (Reduced productivity once you are guaranteed a job)
Market Responses
Signalling - Previous experience, place of education, referees
Screening – Checking resumes for simple errors, psychological tests, hidden cameras, trial periods, performance based pay
Independent reviews – Choice, RACV, the internet, excess for insurance claims
Government responses
Government regulation – Consumer Law banning misleading and deceptive conduct, warranties and refunds are law if products
come with faults, food-labelling laws (Nutrition information),
Government advertising– Making consumers more aware of the benefits of merit goods and the external costs of demerit goods,
health campaigns highlighting the benefits of fruit and vegetables or the risks of smoking

STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.

TITLE: I can define price elasticity of supply and identify the factors that affect it
CODE: 4.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
Price elasticity of supply (PES) measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price. Key factors affecting PES are: spare capacity (more spare capacity means more elastic), the production period (longer production times mean less elastic), and the durability or storability of the good (storable goods are more elastic as existing stock can be released).

WHY (importance):
PES determines how quickly and fully producers can respond to price changes. This affects how much of a tax is passed on to consumers, how quickly shortages are resolved, and how volatile prices are in different markets.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
The supply of fresh strawberries is inelastic in the short run because farmers cannot instantly grow more crops, even if prices spike. However, the supply of manufactured furniture is more elastic because factories with spare capacity can increase production relatively quickly by running extra shifts.

SUBTOPIC: Price Elasticity of Demand and Supply
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the meaning, measurement, and significance of price elasticity of demand (PED) and price elasticity of supply (PES). It explores the factors that determine whether demand or supply is elastic or inelastic and the implications for producers and policy-makers.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Elasticity determines how much quantity responds to a price change, which has direct implications for business revenue, the effectiveness of government taxes and subsidies, and the speed at which markets adjust. It is a tool that turns basic demand and supply analysis into something far more precise and useful.

Wants Needs Resources/ Factors of Production Mixed Economy Utility
Consumer Sovereignty – It is the ability of the consumer in a competitive market economy to direct or allocate
resources. Producers acting in their own self-interest use their scarce resources to produce what consumers demand
due to the extra dollars they can earn. Higher relative prices act as an incentive for producers to shift their resources
to the production of these goods and services due to higher profits.
i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. ix. Chapter 1 – Fundamental Economic Concepts
A definition of economic and economic activity – Economic activity is the volume (or real value) of production,
employment, incomes and expenditure in an economy
The basic economic problem – All wants and needs are infinite while resources (Land, labour and capital) are finite –
This requires individuals/ businesses and governments to make choices about how to allocate their scarce resources
All resources have competing uses – Labour can be dedicated towards manufacturing, service industries etc
Economics is about how resources are allocated among competing uses - Our resources land labour and capital are finite
or limited and can be used in a range of different ways. For example water is a land resource that can be used for a range
of competing uses including drinking, watering plants, cleaning agriculture etc. As a society we must make choices as to
how we will utilise our scarce resources to maximise living standards this is the goal of an economy.
An efficient allocation of resources is one where societies living standards are maximised, resources
are devoted to areas that will maximise utility and opportunity cost is minimised – Include
opportunity cost in your definition
The four factors of production are land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship and all have competing uses (You need
to be able to explain what these competing uses are – E.g. Labour can be used in various ways. You could become a
teacher, plumber, engineer or lawyer, however, because your time is scarce you need to make choices)
Remember to be considered a factor of production the resource must be used to make goods and services for sale. A
car is not a factor of production if it is simply being used by consumers, however a taxi or a pizza delivery car is being
used to provide a service so it would be considered a factor of production
The three economic questions are what, how and for whom to produce – Australia is a market capitalist economy and
will dedicate resources to areas that are the most profitable using the combination of land and labour that is most
efficient and profitable (Consumer sovereignty mainly dictates how resources are allocated with some government
intervention)
The government intervenes because a private market based on the profit motive would lead to a highly uneven
distribution of resources (Only those with particular skills or land would generate high incomes)
7
x. xi. xii. xiii. xiv. xv. xvi. xvii. xviii. xix. Because resources are scarce and have alternative uses economic actors must make choices. Every choice involves an
opportunity costs (The value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made)
Opportunity costs can be measures in dollars, time or external costs passed on to others
The PPF represents the production possibilities available to an economy producing 2 goods and services. Every point
on the PPF is technically efficient, points inside the PPF symbolise and inefficient allocation or resources (E.G. Idle
labour or capital) while points outside the curve are unobtainable at the current point in time
The PPF is bowed outwards because resources are not equally suited to both types of production and therefore the
opportunity cost increases the more of a good or service that is produced
The PPF is downward sloping because every decision requires a trade-off in terms of the other goods
or service (The opportunity cost)
The PPF will shift inwards if there is a fall in the quantity or quality of productive resources available to an economy
(E.g. A cyclone, drought, emigration etc.), the PPF will shift outwards if there is an increase in the quality or quantity
of resources available to an economy (E.g. Increased immigration, new technology, exploration of natural resources,
foreign investment)
The allocatively efficient point on a PPF is dependent on how much society values different goods and services
(Generally only 1 point on the PPF), dynamic efficiency is about how quickly we can shift resources towards the
allocatively efficient point
We assume all economic actors are rational, have preferences, are subject to budget constraints and think at the
margin
Rational economic actors think at the margin. They way up the net benefits and net costs of any decision and make
decisions based on the net benefits exceeding net cost
The law of diminishing marginal utility states that the more of a good or service that is consumed per period the
smaller the increase in utility that is generated from each additional unit.
Productive Capacity– The point at which production (or GDP) is occurring at the maximum level possible in an
economy (The physical limits of production). The economy is at its physical limit or potential to produce goods and
services and resources are being used to maximum efficiency. Boosting a countries productive capacity over time is
critical to boosting material living standards.
Types of Efficiency
An efficient allocation of resources occurs when the needs and wants of society are maximised. The goods and services that
people want will be produced in the best possible way (waste will be minimised and there is no better way to make the product).
When efficiency is achieved it will be impossible to make someone better off without making someone else worse off, the
opportunity cost is minimised and the goods and services that are produced provide the highest level of collective satisfaction
i. Productive/ technical efficiency- Maximising output per unit of input, achieving the least cost method of
production and minimising the use of resources in production. Obtaining the greatest possible production of goods
and services from available resources (Land, capital and labour used to their full potential). Resources are not wasted
in the production process and an economy is producing the best quality product at the lowest opportunity cost.
ii. Allocative efficiency- ensuring the most efficient allocation of scarce resources in an economy in a sense that
resources are producing the goods and services most valued by society and living standards/ welfare is being
maximized. It is represented by only one point on the PPF. Allocative efficiency is about maximizing technical
efficiency whilst also producing what consumers desire (In both the short and long term). When allocative efficiency
occurs no resources will be wasted and it will be impossible to make someone better off without making someone else
worse off. Any change in the way our resources are allocated will reduce national welfare or living standards.
iii. Dynamic efficiency– Refers to how quickly an economy can reallocate resources to achieve allocative efficiency.
Relates to firms being creative and innovative, adapting to latest technology and upgrading workers skills in response
to changing economic conditions. Is it achieved when businesses can adapt their methods of production and output
quickly in response to changes in market conditions or changes in technology (E.g. from point 1 to point 2)
iv. Inter-temporal efficiency- Achieved when an ideal balance is met between using resources (Firms, gov
’t or
nation) to satisfy needs and wants today but conserving resources for the future also. A balance between resource use
for current use and that of future generations.

How could two countries have different allocatively
efficient points on the PPF (Assuming they are
producing the same two goods and services?
Why does improving technical
efficiency help an economy achieve
allocative efficiency?
Assume an economy is achieving technical efficiency. Explain
with the use of an example how it could achieve a more efficient
allocation of resources without pushing out the PPC
- Define allocative efficiency (Maximising
societies welfare/ wants and needs)
- They may value goods differently
Provide an example
- Define technical efficiency
- Help keeps prices low (Production costs
are lower) so consumers have more
purchasing power (Can meet more of
their wants and needs)
- More goods and services available/
choice
- No idle resources/ unemployment
(Higher incomes)
- Define technical efficiency
- State that higher productivity means higher quantity/ volume of
goods and services
- Also means lower prices if markets are competitive increasing
purchasing power – Higher MLS improving Allocative efficiency
- However technical does not imply we are producing what society
values – Could be producing items nobody wants or those that reduce
living standards
- Provide an example
How can the government and businesses promote technical efficiency within the
economy? E.g. What could they do to make businesses more productive?
Government
- Remove unfair dismissal laws, tax concessions for research and development into new
technology (Businesses pay less tax if they invest)
- Build new infrastructure (New roads), lower tariffs, subsidise training programs
Businesses -Invest in capital and machinery, training, performance based pay
How can the government help
ensure inter-temporal
efficiency?
- Define inter-temporal
efficiency
- Carbon tax
- Subsidising clean energy
- Tax concessions for savings
and investment
What are some ways the gov’t can promote
allocative efficiency
- Lower tariffs
- Taxes on cigarettes/ alcohol
- Banning certain products
- Subsidising health care/ education
(Goods with positive externalities)
How can the government and businesses help increase dynamic
efficiency in the economy?
i. Lower tariffs – So we shift resources to areas of comparative advantage
ii. Multiskilling employees – So they shift labour to areas of high demand
quickly
iii. Removing unfair dismissal laws – So they can sack workers when
preferences change
iv. Deregulating the labour market – Pay based on profitability?
v. Technological advances
vi. Investing in alternative energy
vii. Removing subsidies in uncompetitive industries
How does improving
inter-temporal efficiency help
allocative efficiency
- Preserves living standards/ welfare
for future generations
Provide an example
- Research and development into
new green energy (Less floods etc.)
- Savings are needed for future
investment
- Reducing our level of NFD (Helps
to keep taxes low, interest low in
the future)
Explain why dynamic efficiency is needed to
improve allocative efficiency.
Why dynamic efficiency is important – Because it allows us
to quickly shift resources to where they are demanded
ensuring societies welfare/ living standards are increased
(Higher production of goods/ services in demand) increasing
Allocative efficiency
Example – Mining industry and shift in resources – Higher
wages/ income due to strong overseas demand (Consumer
sovereignty), faster we get resources into mining the better
for the economy – Achieve allocative efficiency
This is why market economies are good at achieving
allocative efficiency for the most part – Due to consumer
sovereignty

Really important definition:
Disposable income – The rewards received by households from their contribution to the production process (income
from working plus income from other productive resources) plus government transfers (for example, pensions and
parenting payments) minus direct taxes (i.e. income tax). It represents the total amount that consumers have to spend on
goods and services.
Chapter 2 notes
Features of perfectly competitive markets:
i. A large number of buyers and sellers with each of them having little influence on price (Sellers are Price takers). No
individual buyer or seller has the market power to influence price
ii. Products are homogenous which means they are virtually identical and easily substitutable. This means that suppliers
who offer products at the lower price will attract customers (There is no branding or product differentiation
distinguishing products)
iii. There is ease of entry and exit into the market. There are low set up costs in the industry which means if there are
profit making opportunities available new competitors can quickly enter the market and undercut existing suppliers.
This means ‘Abnormal or supernormal Profits,
’ cannot be made in the long term (Only normal profits).
Other assumptions of perfectly competitive markets:
i. Resources are mobile and can be moved quickly from one market to another which allows price signals to do their job -
Consumer sovereignty dictates where resources are allocated (High demand for products send signals to producers to
produce certain goods and services)
ii. Perfect information (Full information) in that both the buyer and seller know all the information about the product
being sold and other alternatives available in the market. They can compare prices and make rational/ informed
decisions (There is no asymmetric information which can lead to inefficiency).
iii. Both the buyer and seller seek to maximise their own wellbeing, sellers aim to maximise their profits and the
purchaser aims to maximise their utility or satisfaction
Other key information
i. Market or Price Mechanism – Describes how the forces of demand and supply interact to determine (relative)
prices of goods and services in different markets and ultimately how our productive resources are allocated in the
economy
ii. Consumer sovereignty dictates where resources are allocated in Australia’s market capitalist economy. Profit
motivated businesses will shift resources to areas in high demand as they are the most profitable ‘The invisible hand
of the market.
’
10
iii. Changes in relative prices act as signals to producers to direct resources (Land, labour, capital) to these areas of high
demand
iv. Know the law of demand and law of supply really well – The law of demand states the higher the price of a good or
service the smaller the quantity demanded and vice versa
v. Know the reasons the demand curve slopes downwards (Income effect, substitute effect, law of
diminishing marginal utility – At higher prices consumers will buy less of a good or service)
vi. The key microeconomic demand side factors – Disposable income, consumer preferences/tastes,
price of complements, price of substitutes, population, consumer sentiment, interest rates,
demographic changes and advertising
vii. The difference between normal and inferior goods – There is a decreased demand for inferior goods when consumers
disposable incomes rise
viii. Know the reasons the supply curve slopes upwards – Greater profits available at higher prices, increased opportunity
cost associated with shifting resources to other areas, firms are able to more effectively cover the marginal costs
associated with additional production
ix. The key microeconomic supply side factors – Change in capital costs, changes in the cost of
machinery, productivity, improvements in technology, changes in labour costs, changes to
government laws and regulations (Including indirect taxes), climatic conditions, subsidies, the price
of other products using similar resources
x. How a market gets back to equilibrium if the initial price is set too high or too low – The impact of price ceilings
(Causing shortages) and price floors (Causing surpluses) on markets
xi. Shifting the curves – Remember for a shift in demand to occur consumers must be more or less
willing to demand a good at any given price. For a shift in supply to occur producers must be more or
less willing/ able to supply at any given price
xii. Practice getting a market back to equilibrium after a shift in supply or demand and after a double shift in supply and
demand. Mention the initial shortage/ surplus, the change in price, the contraction and expansions and the new
equilibrium point.
xiii.Also mention the value of any shortages and the initial and new equilibrium price if you are given
figures in a graph
xiv. How each shift will impact the price and quantity demanded of a product
Shift in curve New Equilibrium Price New Equilibrium Quantity
Demand Shifts Right Demand shifts left Higher price Lower Price Higher Quantity
Lower quantity
Supply shifts right Lower price Higher quantity
Supply shifts left Higher price Lower quantity
xv. xvi. Some factors that will shift both curves – Changes in oil prices for cars, advertising, changes in interest rates, changes
in the value of the AUD
Remember any excise/ indirect taxes shift supply left not demand left
xvii. Tricky table – Be really careful about what causes a shift vs. a contraction or expansion in
demand and supply
A shift in the demand curve to
the right causes
Impact on demand A contraction in demand - due to the
higher price

xviii. A PED of less than 1 means that demand is inelastic (Elasticity measures the responsiveness of demand to a change
in price)
xix. Revise what is meant by elastic and inelastic demand curves and the fact that a lower price will boost revenue if a
good is ELASTIC and vice versa
xx. Revise the factors that impact elasticity of demand – Degree of necessity, number of substitutes,
time, cost and relative importance (Percentage of income), minor complementary product
xxi. The price of petrol fell significantly in 2015. With reference to the concept of elasticity explain the
impact lower petrol prices are likely to have on household budgets in 2015
Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the percentage change in quantity demanded resulting from a given
percentage change in price. Petrol is generally associated with a low PED because petrol is deemed by consumers and
households to be a necessity with few substitutes.
Lower prices for petrol will not generally result in consumers choosing to drive their car further or more frequently
(because demand is price inelastic), so the total amount spent on petrol is likely to fall. Therefore, lower prices will free up
more of the weekly household budget for savings or other discretionary purchasing decisions, possibly improving the
material living standards of Australian households.
xxii. Revise the factors that impact elasticity of supply – Storability/ perishability, spare capacity/
resource mobility, time
xxiii. Remember that even if a good is INELASTIC the quantity demanded will still change when the price changes – The
proportional change in price will just be greater than the proportional change in demand
xxiv. Spend lots of time on relative prices – Relative prices refer to the price of one good or service in terms of the price
of another good or service
xxv. Key words – Forces of demand and supply, profit motive, price signals, consumer sovereignty,
resources (Land, labour and capital)
xxvi. ALL RELATIVE PRICE ANSWERS MUST USE EXAMPLES TO SHOW HOW RESOURCES SHIFT!
xxvii. Factors causing a change in relative prices – Advertising, fashion tastes, unfavourable supply side conditions, taxes,
demographic changes, tariffs, government assistance (Subsidies)
xxviii. Remember producers will shift resources to areas where there is higher relative profits not higher
relative prices – If higher prices are caused by poor supply side conditions resources will move out
of that industry
xxix. Use the mining boom to show how resources shift from one industry to another in response to
changing prices - More resources were allocated to expanding existing mines and building new mines (Capital
resources reallocated to mining and away from other forms of investment) – Capital reallocated. It also lead to the
reallocation of labour to the mining sector (Builders, surveyors, engineers, truck drivers. IT specialists quickly
applied for jobs and moved to W.A.)
xxx. Relative prices determine how to produce – Producers will use the combination of land and capital that is most cost
effective
xxxi. For whom to produce is determined by people’s relative wages determining their access to goods and services
From CPAP Study Guide: Examples of factors changing relative prices (VOD) Streaming of Content
Consumer tastes and preferences:
Another example of the impact of changing consumer tastes and preferences is in the rapidly growing preference for
video-on-demand (VOD) streaming of content. VOD means that viewers can watch a variety of TV programmes, as
well as subscription services and other digital content online.
This includes catch-up TV services such as iView and SBS on Demand. All of the free-to-air TV stations have a
downloadable app, so that viewers can watch content on many types of devices –including computers, tablets and
smartphones.
12
Changing consumer tastes and preferences have contributed to this shift in demand – people want to watch what
they want, when they want it and how they want it.
The Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) reported that in the six months to June 2016, 63% of
adult Australians had content online.
Furthermore, as of July 2016, there were 2.7 million paid SVOD subscriptions in Australia. This means that 2.7
million subscribers joined subscription video services within two years of the launch of such services in Australia.
In fact, 32% of Australians watch SVOD content. Subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix, Stan and
Presto are also relatively low cost, compared to average incomes. For example, a subscriber can access each service’s
whole catalogue of TV and films for $10 a month.
What have these changed consumer preferences meant for entertainment markets in Australia?
As a consequence of changing preferences, there has been a gradual decline in free-to-air TV viewing, and particularly at
the time of broadcast.
As keen students of economics, you will be aware that resources have been reallocated into those markets where
consumers have shown increased preference (demand) for products.
Traffic to iView doubles roughly every 18 months, and the service continues to command an ever growing proportion of
the ABC budget to keep it up and running.
On the other hand, forecasts from ACMA indicate that SVOD paid subscribers will overtake the number of Foxtel
subscribers by 2019, as Foxtel is a relatively more expensive option. (In order to compete, Foxtel has also been forced to
offer a simpler version of its service- Foxtel Play – with subscriptions starting at $10 month.)
The increasing popularity of SVOD services has also seen the end of other Australian online video-on-demand services.
Quickflix went into administration in early 2016, following on from the closure of locally owned on-demand service
EzyFlix in August 2015.
The ready and cheap availability of complementary products- such as unlimited data packages from telecommunications
providers – has also driven demand for SVOD services.
In addition, the devices required to access SVOD services – computers, mobile devices, Apple TVs, Google’s Chromecast,
and Smart TVs – have all been falling in price.

The nature of and conditions for a perfectly competitive market
There are very few markets in Australia that meet the preconditions for being a perfectly competitive market – namely,
the market has a large number of buyers and sellers such that no buyer or seller has the power to influence price, the
products being sold are largely identical and easy to substitute for each other (homogenous), and it is easy to enter and
leave the market when profit opportunities exist, because there are low set up costs.
Reasons the introduction of Uber makes the ride sharing industry closer to perfect competition:
Until the arrival of the ride sharing service, UberX in April 2014, the market for point-to-point passenger travel (the
taxi market) showed characteristics of a monopoly or duopoly– a very small number of providers dominated the
market.
In Victoria, that was 13Cabs and Silvertop Taxis. To provide services, a driver would have to purchase a taxi license
(which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each) and register with one of the two taxi companies. Fares (prices)
were largely unresponsive to demand.
As mentioned earlier, UberX is a ridesharing service using a mobile application that connects passengers to willing
private drivers. It provides a service similar to a taxi.
The Uber Corporation provides the app and overseas the services, but ultimately the drivers are working for
themselves. This type of service is often referred to as ‘point-to-point’ passenger travel.
The arrival of UberX has transformed the market for point-to-point passenger travel – and had the effect of increasing
the level of competition in the market, such that it now more closely resembles perfect competition.
Reasons the market now resembles perfect competition
i. Low barriers to entry:
Drivers can register with UberX without significant barriers to entry. They must possess a valid driver’s licence and a
registered, roadworthy vehicle, and pass a basic background check, but generally the set-up costs are relatively low,
and hence the barriers to entry (and exit) in the market have been reduced.
ii. Lots of buyers and sellers and increased homogeneity
The arrival of Uber on the global market has led to the emergence of other ride sharing platforms – including Lyft,
DiDi Kuaidi (China’s largest lift sharing service) and Ingog
These services have begun to imitate each other, such that increasingly the product being offered is becoming more
homogenous.
In addition, as the product offered by ride sharing services becomes similar, the companies are increasingly competing
on price - bidding each other’s prices down – just as we would expect in a more competitive market.
17
As the popularity and profile of UberX has increased in Australia, larger and larger number of individuals have signed
up to offer their service as Uber drivers and more and more consumers have become UberX customers.
Figures from an Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal survey in February 2015 found around one in 10
Sydneysiders had used ride-sharing services. This has meant the market further replicates another condition of perfect
competition – a large number of buyers and sellers.
iii.Perfect information
A rating system for drivers and riders (passengers) of UberX has contributed to transparency in the market, and
improved the level of information for both participants in the transaction.
In economics, we refer to this as reducing the information asymmetries in the market, or increasing the degree to
which ‘perfect information’ exists in the market.
Once again, this has helped both consumers (passengers) and producers (drivers) to make more efficient decisions and
results in a more competitive market.
iv.Surge pricing (Demand and supply determine prices)
One further key feature of ride sharing services which replicates the predicted conditions and consequences of a
perfectly competitive market is the use of ‘surge pricing.
’
During periods of peak demand, the prices for rides charged by Uber increase substantially. For example, prior to New
Year’s Eve 2016, Uber warned that there would be an increase in prices of its services.
As an Uber spokesperson said at the time ‘During times of peak demand - on New Year’s Eve that’s around between
midnight and 3am, fares increase via an algorithm to help ensure a driver is always nearby and you can get a ride if you
need one.
’
According to economic theory this should work – an increase in the price of a product will lead to an increase in supply
of that product, without any other changes in supply conditions for the product. On a D/S diagram, this would be
represented by an expansion along the existing supply curve.
Competitive Markets and Efficiency
i. Market structures refers to the way particular industries are structured/ organised in terms of the number of firms,
degree of competition, level of efficiency and ease of entry and exit into the market etc.
ii. Perfect competition – Many buyers and sellers with perfect information meaning firms are price takers, homogenous
products (Explain what this means), firms can enter and exit the market freely (No large exit fees), licences or set up
costs, all buyers and sellers have perfect information and all resources are mobile
iii. If a perfectly competitive market is making abnormal profits new competitors enter the market and force prices down
until firms only make normal profits (This may not be the case with oligopolies
iv. Perfect markets are generally the most efficient because
- Resources will be allocated to areas of societies best interest (Consumer sovereignty) in the right quantities (No body
has the power to restrict supply – Allocative efficiency), competition ensure businesses strive to be as technically
efficient as possible to stay competitive
- Businesses must invest in new technology and better production techniques to remain competitive), factor mobility
ensures dynamic and allocative efficiency, suppliers need to pay close attention to price signals or you can become
uncompetitive
v. More concentrated markets like monopolies are less efficient because
- A lack of competition amongst suppliers can lead to businesses abusing their power and charging excessive prices
(Price makers), producers can restrict output leading to under allocation of resources to certain areas valued by society
(Less allocative efficiency, decreasing NMLS)
- Consumers have little choice but to buy the product from them leading to reduced allocative efficiency– May not use
the best production techniques or inputs as there is less pressure to cut costs (Technical efficiency).
18
Competitive markets and efficiency
Key features (Must be explained in detail)– Many buyers and sellers (Price takers), homogenous products, ease of entry and exit, perfect information, mobile resources, buyers and
sellers are rational and aim to maximise their well-being, consumer sovereignty dictates resource allocation and only normal profits are made
Competitive markets and allocative efficiency
Competitive markets and technical efficiency
Definition - The combination of goods and services (Produced and consumed)
which achieves the highest level of collective satisfaction for a society.
Definition- Technical efficiency is the effectiveness with which a given set of inputs is used to produce an
output. A firm is said to be technically efficient if a firm is producing the maximum output from the
minimum quantity of inputs, such as labour, capital and technology.
Reasons free markets promote allocative efficiency
Reasons free markets promote technical efficiency
i. Producers pay close attention to price signals and therefore meet
consumers demand – Shortage, increased prices, higher profits etc.
There is a discipline to seek the least cost method of production (Because products are very
similar and only competing on price)
ii. Production is not constrained when there is high demand (No
barriers to entry) so they produce enough and meet demand
ii. Great incentive to keep expenses down and reduce waste
Prices are lower due to competition and incentive to invest in better
production techniques, minimise waste and boost productivity
(Increased MLS)
Firms are always looking for better production techniques, better management practices and
ways to more effectively utilise technology
Improving productivity means existing resources can achieve high production volumes
Factor mobility ensure resources are quickly switched to meet
consumer’s needs (Dynamic efficiency)
This boosts allocative efficiency as products are cheaper and consumers have more choice
(Maximising welfare)
iii. iv. i. iii. iv. v. Competitive markets and dynamic efficiency
Dynamic efficiency– The ability of an economic system to move to a new allocatively
efficient point following a change in conditions of demand and/or supply. How quickly the
market responds to changes in relative prices by reallocating resources into the now relatively
more profitable (More desired) areas of production.
Reasons free markets promote dynamic efficiency
i. In competitive markets the movement to the new equilibrium prices happens quickly.
ii. Suppliers constantly monitor price changes to maximise their profits and move
resources as quickly as possible to areas of production that are the most profitable.
iii. Resources are mobile and can be substituted into different areas of production because
of low set up costs making it easier to shift resources into profitable areas.
iv. Demand will often be met because new competitors will enter the market as the relative
price of a product increases (Unlike in some other markets where it can be difficult for
new companies to enter the market).
v. Firms will constantly change the types of products they produce if it is in their best
interest/ if it’s profitable.
Competitive markets and inter-temporal efficiency
Definition- Achieving a balance between current and future levels of societal satisfaction. If
we achieving inter-temporal efficiency the living standards of future generations should not be
jeopardised by the current generation.
Pro’s and con’s of free markets for inter-temporal efficiency
Pro - If there is excessive spending and not enough saving the ‘Money market’ may
experience a shortage of funds for investment (Not enough money for borrowing).
Demand for funds will outweigh supply leading to a shortage and increased interest rates
helping to rebalance the level of spending in the economy (Encouraging savings and
discouraging spending due to the higher opportunity cost associated with spending).
Con – Essential infrastructure can be neglected
Con – People value the present more than the future leading to sustainability issues. Relative
prices don’t always reflect the true costs and benefits of products.
Products with ‘Negative externalities’ like coal based electricity may be overproduced if they
are more profitable for firms causing climate change (Harming future generations)
19
i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. Market Failure
Definition of market failure - When the unregulated market is unable to allocate resources to maximise welfare or living
standards of society. When the price system, self-interest and consumer sovereignty are unsuccessful or inefficient in directing
resources into areas that promote the public interest (Allocative efficiency not achieved – Net benefits not maximised)
Four types of market failure you need to be aware of – Externalities (Positive and negative), public goods, asymmetric
information and common access resources
You also need to be aware of how the government intervenes to prevent or limit the impact of each of the 4 market failures
Characteristics of public goods (Non-excludable and non-rivalrous), why public goods and under allocated in a free market
(The free rider effect), examples, the Government solution to the inefficient allocation is to provide the public good at
approximately the level that the population values it with taxpayers money.
Definitions of both positive and negative externalities - Externalities arise when a person is engaged in a transaction (or
activity) that affects the wellbeing of a third party who is not involved in the transaction or activity.
They can be positive or negative and can occur in production or consumption. Producers and consumers often ignore these
third party externalities leading to an inefficient market
Externalities create a divergence between the private and social costs or benefits of production. Social cost includes all the
costs of production and the third party (external) costs arising, for example, from pollution of the atmosphere.

ix. x. xi. xii. xiii. xiv. xv. xvi. How the government intervene to prevent negative externalities - Governments use their power to regulate the market and
use taxes to affect relative prices – Taxes aim is to force the producer or consumer to internalise (pay for) the external cost
that has been imposed on a third party (Make private cost = social cost. Higher prices will generally decrease demand, shift
demand to substitutes that have smaller external costs
Other ways to prevent negative externalities – Age identification, licences, laws, government inspectors
Positive externalities - This occurs when the consumption or production of a good causes a benefit to a third party. In free
markets producers often under-allocate resources to areas where there are positive third party externalities
Merit Goods: Some goods and services are highly desirable. It is felt that all people should have access to them, and as such
even though they are provided by the free market the total level of demand is not satisfied E.g. Schools, Hospitals, Libraries
The government can help provide merit goods like education via – Subsidies, direct production, research
grants, minimum school leaving ages, legislation to ensure sufficient resources are allocated to these areas
Asymmetric information occurs when one party to a transaction has more information about the good or service (Occurs
when a consumer or supplier cannot gain full information about a product) leading to an inefficient allocation of resources-
It can lead to adverse selection and moral hazard
Hidden action is when one person in a transaction can act in a way that cannot be observed by the other party. Hidden
Characteristics occur when one side of the market knows more than the other about the product’s characteristics that are
relevant to the transaction.
Adverse selection occurs when one party knows more about the product than the other does. Thus the uninformed party may
therefore purchase adversely, resulting in an over or under allocation of resources to the production of that good or service. It
happens in the used car market and can lead to an over-allocation of resources to poor second hand cars and
under-allocation of resources to quality second hand cars
20
xvii. xviii. xix. i. Moral hazard is when economic agents adjust their behaviour to one that is less efficient from society
’s point of view due to
unobservable actions.
E.g. Health Insurance, Drivers, Workers, Banks. It leads to a change in incentives and a decrease in the efficiency of resource
allocation. It can also lead to safe drivers having to pay more for car insurance that they should because insurance companies
need to cover the extra claims of unsafe drivers, driving recklessly because they have insurance.
The private sector can help prevent asymmetric information via screening and signalling, independent reviews using the
internet and removing unfair dismissal laws (Preventing the principal agent problem)
The government can help prevent asymmetric information via - Trade practices legislation (Consumer
Law) preventing misleading and deceptive conduct ($250,000 fine), laws relating to warranties and
defective products, product disclosures and employment and contract laws that provide protection to
employers and employees that may face principal/agent problems (6 month trial periods, individual
contracts, removal of unfair dismissal laws)
Government Failure
Government failure occurs when governments intervene in the free operation of markets and in doing so cause inefficiencies,
reducing the satisfaction of society
’s needs and wants and lowering living standards. They make mistakes and reduce competition
Identify what is meant by the term government failure and explain one example of how government
intervention in the market can unintentionally lead to a less efficient allocation of resources (4 marks)
MINIMUM WAGES
Government failure is a situation where government intervention fails to improve the allocation of resources or actually
makes the allocation of resources less efficient compared to the free market outcome. Gov
’t failure can arise because it was
unnecessary for the gov
’t to intervene and their actions have led to a distortion of the price mechanism unnecessarily to alter
the allocation of resources in such a manner that it has reduced society
’s overall satisfaction
An efficient allocation of resources in the economy requires that all resources (e.g. labour and capital) are used in
combinations and applications such that national welfare is at a maximum.
The minimum wage is designed to protect workers with weak bargaining power from exploitation in the workforce. It is a
safety net so those on the minimum wage are above the poverty line and can afford basic goods and services.
The minimum wage however, can lead to undesirable consequences including the fact that many markets will not be in
equilibrium. When the minimum wage is set above the market clearing wage labour supply is greater than labour demand
which leads to unemployment in many industries. This is an inefficient allocation of resources as valuable labour is not being
utilised in the production process. This will lead to a country working inside its PPF and the maximum volume of production
and satisfaction cannot be achieved (Reducing technical and allocative efficiency).
Higher minimum wages can also reduce the gap between wages in high and low skilled professions covered by the minimum
wage which can lead to relative wages not being reflective of market conditions. This could potentially cause an under
allocation of scarce labour resources to certain profession because the relatively higher wage does not justify the extra
training or effort. This could lead to a more uneducated workforce and a drop in technical efficiency.
SUBSIDIES AND PROTECTIONISM
A government subsidy can unintentionally penalise other producers for a number of reasons. For example, the subsidy to
Alcoa enables it to bid up the price of resources such as labour and other inputs, which effectively increases the costs of
production for other producers. In addition, to the extent that the subsidies force governments [both state and federal] to
raise (business) taxes in order to fund the subsidy, it once more leads to an increase in the costs of production for other
businesses.
An efficient allocation of resources in the economy requires that all resources (e.g. labour and capital) are used in
combinations and applications such that national welfare is at a maximum. If subsidies are not specifically used to rectify a
market failure (e.g. to promote the production of goods or services with positive externalities in production or consumption)
then they can lead to a less efficient allocation of resources.
In the case of subsidies in general, they have typically led to a less efficient allocation of resources, by diverting resources
away from those industries or activities in which Australia has a comparative advantage (e.g. tourism and education) and
towards those industries (e.g. manufacturing) in which Australia is relatively less [technically] efficient. Like protection more
generally, subsidies worked to protect local firms from the rigours of international competition and allowed many relatively
‘inefficient’ businesses to remain viable. As highlighted in the first paragraph, this penalised other producers, raising their
costs of production and prices, which ultimately led to a misallocation of the nation’s resources and a reduction in economic
(allocative) efficiency.
21
Positive and Negative externalities Most of the information on positive and negative
externalities is above
It is important that you clearly state that the private and
social costs or benefits differ in transactions with
positive or negative externalities
Education is a key positive externality in consumption –
The third party benefits include a more productive
workforce, lower unemployment rates (Helping the
gov’t), lower crime rates, better health outcomes,
increased taxes.
There is an under allocation of resources to education
because consumers don’t receive all these benefits and
in a free market the private cost may outweigh the
private benefit (Even if the social benefit exceeds the
private cost)
Gov’t intervenes – Minimum school leaving age,
subsidising private schools, providing public schools
free of charge to internalise the social benefits
Government intervention
Government regulation
- Laws banning certain activities and making others
mandatory (E.g. Bike helmets), compulsory
education (Shifting demand right), No Jab No Pay
for vaccinations (Stripping childcare subsidies for
those who don’t vaccinate their children)
Advertising (Very important) – Shifts demand
right for pos. externalities and left for neg. ext.
- Programs on healthy eating and staying active to
reduce the number of days lost to sickness and boost
productivity and boosting allocative efficiency,
promotion of cancer screening, Flight Flu campaign,
SunSmart
- QUIT campaigns, black balloon climate change adds
Subsidies for education (HECS help) and R and
D, indirect taxation
Types of Market Failure and government intervention
Asymmetric information
Sometimes the producers or consumer does not possesses full information about a good or service which can lead to a less efficient
allocation of resources
Asymmetric information– A market transaction when one party has access to more information than the other
Seller has more information than buyer – Lemon cars, fake jewellery
Leads to adverse selection– Individuals buys a faulty car (Hurting their welfare – Less allocatively efficient)
- Those with second hand cars hold on to their cars longer than they should because they know they won’t get a fair price for them
- Reputable sellers cannot get a fair price for their second hand car because consumers become more cautious about buying second
hand cars
- Not enough resources are allocated towards good second hand cars
Other situations– Dentists overcharging or undertaking unnecessary procedures to make more money reducing consumers material
living standards and their ability to purchase other goods and services, mechanics over-charging leading to significant transactions costs
as people search for fair/ reasonable mechanics
Buyer has more information than seller
Insurance contracts. Low risk customers effectively subsidise high risk customers
Moral hazard – Consumers change their behaviour in a way that is less efficient for society as the costs are transferred to other parties
- Some healthy citizens or safe drivers don’t get insurance as it is too expensive leading to an under allocation to insurance
services
- Another example is an employment contract (Reduced productivity once you are guaranteed a job)
Market Responses
Signalling - Previous experience, place of education, referees
Screening – Checking resumes for simple errors, psychological tests, hidden cameras, trial periods, performance based pay
Independent reviews – Choice, RACV, the internet, excess for insurance claims
Government responses
Government regulation – Consumer Law banning misleading and deceptive conduct, warranties and refunds are law if products
come with faults, food-labelling laws (Nutrition information),
Government advertising– Making consumers more aware of the benefits of merit goods and the external costs of demerit goods,
health campaigns highlighting the benefits of fruit and vegetables or the risks of smoking

TITLE: I can define price elasticity of supply and identify the factors that affect it
CODE: 4.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
Price elasticity of supply (PES) measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price. Key factors affecting PES are: spare capacity (more spare capacity means more elastic), the production period (longer production times mean less elastic), and the durability or storability of the good (storable goods are more elastic as existing stock can be released).

WHY (importance):
PES determines how quickly and fully producers can respond to price changes. This affects how much of a tax is passed on to consumers, how quickly shortages are resolved, and how volatile prices are in different markets.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
The supply of fresh strawberries is inelastic in the short run because farmers cannot instantly grow more crops, even if prices spike. However, the supply of manufactured furniture is more elastic because factories with spare capacity can increase production relatively quickly by running extra shifts.

SUBTOPIC: Price Elasticity of Demand and Supply
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the meaning, measurement, and significance of price elasticity of demand (PED) and price elasticity of supply (PES). It explores the factors that determine whether demand or supply is elastic or inelastic and the implications for producers and policy-makers.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Elasticity determines how much quantity responds to a price change, which has direct implications for business revenue, the effectiveness of government taxes and subsidies, and the speed at which markets adjust. It is a tool that turns basic demand and supply analysis into something far more precise and useful.

Wants Needs Resources/ Factors of Production Mixed Economy Utility
Consumer Sovereignty – It is the ability of the consumer in a competitive market economy to direct or allocate
resources. Producers acting in their own self-interest use their scarce resources to produce what consumers demand
due to the extra dollars they can earn. Higher relative prices act as an incentive for producers to shift their resources
to the production of these goods and services due to higher profits.
i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. ix. Chapter 1 – Fundamental Economic Concepts
A definition of economic and economic activity – Economic activity is the volume (or real value) of production,
employment, incomes and expenditure in an economy
The basic economic problem – All wants and needs are infinite while resources (Land, labour and capital) are finite –
This requires individuals/ businesses and governments to make choices about how to allocate their scarce resources
All resources have competing uses – Labour can be dedicated towards manufacturing, service industries etc
Economics is about how resources are allocated among competing uses - Our resources land labour and capital are finite
or limited and can be used in a range of different ways. For example water is a land resource that can be used for a range
of competing uses including drinking, watering plants, cleaning agriculture etc. As a society we must make choices as to
how we will utilise our scarce resources to maximise living standards this is the goal of an economy.
An efficient allocation of resources is one where societies living standards are maximised, resources
are devoted to areas that will maximise utility and opportunity cost is minimised – Include
opportunity cost in your definition
The four factors of production are land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship and all have competing uses (You need
to be able to explain what these competing uses are – E.g. Labour can be used in various ways. You could become a
teacher, plumber, engineer or lawyer, however, because your time is scarce you need to make choices)
Remember to be considered a factor of production the resource must be used to make goods and services for sale. A
car is not a factor of production if it is simply being used by consumers, however a taxi or a pizza delivery car is being
used to provide a service so it would be considered a factor of production
The three economic questions are what, how and for whom to produce – Australia is a market capitalist economy and
will dedicate resources to areas that are the most profitable using the combination of land and labour that is most
efficient and profitable (Consumer sovereignty mainly dictates how resources are allocated with some government
intervention)
The government intervenes because a private market based on the profit motive would lead to a highly uneven
distribution of resources (Only those with particular skills or land would generate high incomes)
7
x. xi. xii. xiii. xiv. xv. xvi. xvii. xviii. xix. Because resources are scarce and have alternative uses economic actors must make choices. Every choice involves an
opportunity costs (The value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made)
Opportunity costs can be measures in dollars, time or external costs passed on to others
The PPF represents the production possibilities available to an economy producing 2 goods and services. Every point
on the PPF is technically efficient, points inside the PPF symbolise and inefficient allocation or resources (E.G. Idle
labour or capital) while points outside the curve are unobtainable at the current point in time
The PPF is bowed outwards because resources are not equally suited to both types of production and therefore the
opportunity cost increases the more of a good or service that is produced
The PPF is downward sloping because every decision requires a trade-off in terms of the other goods
or service (The opportunity cost)
The PPF will shift inwards if there is a fall in the quantity or quality of productive resources available to an economy
(E.g. A cyclone, drought, emigration etc.), the PPF will shift outwards if there is an increase in the quality or quantity
of resources available to an economy (E.g. Increased immigration, new technology, exploration of natural resources,
foreign investment)
The allocatively efficient point on a PPF is dependent on how much society values different goods and services
(Generally only 1 point on the PPF), dynamic efficiency is about how quickly we can shift resources towards the
allocatively efficient point
We assume all economic actors are rational, have preferences, are subject to budget constraints and think at the
margin
Rational economic actors think at the margin. They way up the net benefits and net costs of any decision and make
decisions based on the net benefits exceeding net cost
The law of diminishing marginal utility states that the more of a good or service that is consumed per period the
smaller the increase in utility that is generated from each additional unit.
Productive Capacity– The point at which production (or GDP) is occurring at the maximum level possible in an
economy (The physical limits of production). The economy is at its physical limit or potential to produce goods and
services and resources are being used to maximum efficiency. Boosting a countries productive capacity over time is
critical to boosting material living standards.
Types of Efficiency
An efficient allocation of resources occurs when the needs and wants of society are maximised. The goods and services that
people want will be produced in the best possible way (waste will be minimised and there is no better way to make the product).
When efficiency is achieved it will be impossible to make someone better off without making someone else worse off, the
opportunity cost is minimised and the goods and services that are produced provide the highest level of collective satisfaction
i. Productive/ technical efficiency- Maximising output per unit of input, achieving the least cost method of
production and minimising the use of resources in production. Obtaining the greatest possible production of goods
and services from available resources (Land, capital and labour used to their full potential). Resources are not wasted
in the production process and an economy is producing the best quality product at the lowest opportunity cost.
ii. Allocative efficiency- ensuring the most efficient allocation of scarce resources in an economy in a sense that
resources are producing the goods and services most valued by society and living standards/ welfare is being
maximized. It is represented by only one point on the PPF. Allocative efficiency is about maximizing technical
efficiency whilst also producing what consumers desire (In both the short and long term). When allocative efficiency
occurs no resources will be wasted and it will be impossible to make someone better off without making someone else
worse off. Any change in the way our resources are allocated will reduce national welfare or living standards.
iii. Dynamic efficiency– Refers to how quickly an economy can reallocate resources to achieve allocative efficiency.
Relates to firms being creative and innovative, adapting to latest technology and upgrading workers skills in response
to changing economic conditions. Is it achieved when businesses can adapt their methods of production and output
quickly in response to changes in market conditions or changes in technology (E.g. from point 1 to point 2)
iv. Inter-temporal efficiency- Achieved when an ideal balance is met between using resources (Firms, gov
’t or
nation) to satisfy needs and wants today but conserving resources for the future also. A balance between resource use
for current use and that of future generations.

How could two countries have different allocatively
efficient points on the PPF (Assuming they are
producing the same two goods and services?
Why does improving technical
efficiency help an economy achieve
allocative efficiency?
Assume an economy is achieving technical efficiency. Explain
with the use of an example how it could achieve a more efficient
allocation of resources without pushing out the PPC
- Define allocative efficiency (Maximising
societies welfare/ wants and needs)
- They may value goods differently
Provide an example
- Define technical efficiency
- Help keeps prices low (Production costs
are lower) so consumers have more
purchasing power (Can meet more of
their wants and needs)
- More goods and services available/
choice
- No idle resources/ unemployment
(Higher incomes)
- Define technical efficiency
- State that higher productivity means higher quantity/ volume of
goods and services
- Also means lower prices if markets are competitive increasing
purchasing power – Higher MLS improving Allocative efficiency
- However technical does not imply we are producing what society
values – Could be producing items nobody wants or those that reduce
living standards
- Provide an example
How can the government and businesses promote technical efficiency within the
economy? E.g. What could they do to make businesses more productive?
Government
- Remove unfair dismissal laws, tax concessions for research and development into new
technology (Businesses pay less tax if they invest)
- Build new infrastructure (New roads), lower tariffs, subsidise training programs
Businesses -Invest in capital and machinery, training, performance based pay
How can the government help
ensure inter-temporal
efficiency?
- Define inter-temporal
efficiency
- Carbon tax
- Subsidising clean energy
- Tax concessions for savings
and investment
What are some ways the gov’t can promote
allocative efficiency
- Lower tariffs
- Taxes on cigarettes/ alcohol
- Banning certain products
- Subsidising health care/ education
(Goods with positive externalities)
How can the government and businesses help increase dynamic
efficiency in the economy?
i. Lower tariffs – So we shift resources to areas of comparative advantage
ii. Multiskilling employees – So they shift labour to areas of high demand
quickly
iii. Removing unfair dismissal laws – So they can sack workers when
preferences change
iv. Deregulating the labour market – Pay based on profitability?
v. Technological advances
vi. Investing in alternative energy
vii. Removing subsidies in uncompetitive industries
How does improving
inter-temporal efficiency help
allocative efficiency
- Preserves living standards/ welfare
for future generations
Provide an example
- Research and development into
new green energy (Less floods etc.)
- Savings are needed for future
investment
- Reducing our level of NFD (Helps
to keep taxes low, interest low in
the future)
Explain why dynamic efficiency is needed to
improve allocative efficiency.
Why dynamic efficiency is important – Because it allows us
to quickly shift resources to where they are demanded
ensuring societies welfare/ living standards are increased
(Higher production of goods/ services in demand) increasing
Allocative efficiency
Example – Mining industry and shift in resources – Higher
wages/ income due to strong overseas demand (Consumer
sovereignty), faster we get resources into mining the better
for the economy – Achieve allocative efficiency
This is why market economies are good at achieving
allocative efficiency for the most part – Due to consumer
sovereignty

Really important definition:
Disposable income – The rewards received by households from their contribution to the production process (income
from working plus income from other productive resources) plus government transfers (for example, pensions and
parenting payments) minus direct taxes (i.e. income tax). It represents the total amount that consumers have to spend on
goods and services.
Chapter 2 notes
Features of perfectly competitive markets:
i. A large number of buyers and sellers with each of them having little influence on price (Sellers are Price takers). No
individual buyer or seller has the market power to influence price
ii. Products are homogenous which means they are virtually identical and easily substitutable. This means that suppliers
who offer products at the lower price will attract customers (There is no branding or product differentiation
distinguishing products)
iii. There is ease of entry and exit into the market. There are low set up costs in the industry which means if there are
profit making opportunities available new competitors can quickly enter the market and undercut existing suppliers.
This means ‘Abnormal or supernormal Profits,
’ cannot be made in the long term (Only normal profits).
Other assumptions of perfectly competitive markets:
i. Resources are mobile and can be moved quickly from one market to another which allows price signals to do their job -
Consumer sovereignty dictates where resources are allocated (High demand for products send signals to producers to
produce certain goods and services)
ii. Perfect information (Full information) in that both the buyer and seller know all the information about the product
being sold and other alternatives available in the market. They can compare prices and make rational/ informed
decisions (There is no asymmetric information which can lead to inefficiency).
iii. Both the buyer and seller seek to maximise their own wellbeing, sellers aim to maximise their profits and the
purchaser aims to maximise their utility or satisfaction
Other key information
i. Market or Price Mechanism – Describes how the forces of demand and supply interact to determine (relative)
prices of goods and services in different markets and ultimately how our productive resources are allocated in the
economy
ii. Consumer sovereignty dictates where resources are allocated in Australia’s market capitalist economy. Profit
motivated businesses will shift resources to areas in high demand as they are the most profitable ‘The invisible hand
of the market.
’
10
iii. Changes in relative prices act as signals to producers to direct resources (Land, labour, capital) to these areas of high
demand
iv. Know the law of demand and law of supply really well – The law of demand states the higher the price of a good or
service the smaller the quantity demanded and vice versa
v. Know the reasons the demand curve slopes downwards (Income effect, substitute effect, law of
diminishing marginal utility – At higher prices consumers will buy less of a good or service)
vi. The key microeconomic demand side factors – Disposable income, consumer preferences/tastes,
price of complements, price of substitutes, population, consumer sentiment, interest rates,
demographic changes and advertising
vii. The difference between normal and inferior goods – There is a decreased demand for inferior goods when consumers
disposable incomes rise
viii. Know the reasons the supply curve slopes upwards – Greater profits available at higher prices, increased opportunity
cost associated with shifting resources to other areas, firms are able to more effectively cover the marginal costs
associated with additional production
ix. The key microeconomic supply side factors – Change in capital costs, changes in the cost of
machinery, productivity, improvements in technology, changes in labour costs, changes to
government laws and regulations (Including indirect taxes), climatic conditions, subsidies, the price
of other products using similar resources
x. How a market gets back to equilibrium if the initial price is set too high or too low – The impact of price ceilings
(Causing shortages) and price floors (Causing surpluses) on markets
xi. Shifting the curves – Remember for a shift in demand to occur consumers must be more or less
willing to demand a good at any given price. For a shift in supply to occur producers must be more or
less willing/ able to supply at any given price
xii. Practice getting a market back to equilibrium after a shift in supply or demand and after a double shift in supply and
demand. Mention the initial shortage/ surplus, the change in price, the contraction and expansions and the new
equilibrium point.
xiii.Also mention the value of any shortages and the initial and new equilibrium price if you are given
figures in a graph
xiv. How each shift will impact the price and quantity demanded of a product
Shift in curve New Equilibrium Price New Equilibrium Quantity
Demand Shifts Right Demand shifts left Higher price Lower Price Higher Quantity
Lower quantity
Supply shifts right Lower price Higher quantity
Supply shifts left Higher price Lower quantity
xv. xvi. Some factors that will shift both curves – Changes in oil prices for cars, advertising, changes in interest rates, changes
in the value of the AUD
Remember any excise/ indirect taxes shift supply left not demand left
xvii. Tricky table – Be really careful about what causes a shift vs. a contraction or expansion in
demand and supply
A shift in the demand curve to
the right causes
Impact on demand A contraction in demand - due to the
higher price
Impact on supply
An expansion in supply – Due to the

xviii. A PED of less than 1 means that demand is inelastic (Elasticity measures the responsiveness of demand to a change
in price)
xix. Revise what is meant by elastic and inelastic demand curves and the fact that a lower price will boost revenue if a
good is ELASTIC and vice versa
xx. Revise the factors that impact elasticity of demand – Degree of necessity, number of substitutes,
time, cost and relative importance (Percentage of income), minor complementary product
xxi. The price of petrol fell significantly in 2015. With reference to the concept of elasticity explain the
impact lower petrol prices are likely to have on household budgets in 2015
Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the percentage change in quantity demanded resulting from a given
percentage change in price. Petrol is generally associated with a low PED because petrol is deemed by consumers and
households to be a necessity with few substitutes.
Lower prices for petrol will not generally result in consumers choosing to drive their car further or more frequently
(because demand is price inelastic), so the total amount spent on petrol is likely to fall. Therefore, lower prices will free up
more of the weekly household budget for savings or other discretionary purchasing decisions, possibly improving the
material living standards of Australian households.
xxii. Revise the factors that impact elasticity of supply – Storability/ perishability, spare capacity/
resource mobility, time
xxiii. Remember that even if a good is INELASTIC the quantity demanded will still change when the price changes – The
proportional change in price will just be greater than the proportional change in demand
xxiv. Spend lots of time on relative prices – Relative prices refer to the price of one good or service in terms of the price
of another good or service
xxv. Key words – Forces of demand and supply, profit motive, price signals, consumer sovereignty,
resources (Land, labour and capital)
xxvi. ALL RELATIVE PRICE ANSWERS MUST USE EXAMPLES TO SHOW HOW RESOURCES SHIFT!
xxvii. Factors causing a change in relative prices – Advertising, fashion tastes, unfavourable supply side conditions, taxes,
demographic changes, tariffs, government assistance (Subsidies)
xxviii. Remember producers will shift resources to areas where there is higher relative profits not higher
relative prices – If higher prices are caused by poor supply side conditions resources will move out
of that industry
xxix. Use the mining boom to show how resources shift from one industry to another in response to
changing prices - More resources were allocated to expanding existing mines and building new mines (Capital
resources reallocated to mining and away from other forms of investment) – Capital reallocated. It also lead to the
reallocation of labour to the mining sector (Builders, surveyors, engineers, truck drivers. IT specialists quickly
applied for jobs and moved to W.A.)
xxx. Relative prices determine how to produce – Producers will use the combination of land and capital that is most cost
effective
xxxi. For whom to produce is determined by people’s relative wages determining their access to goods and services
From CPAP Study Guide: Examples of factors changing relative prices (VOD) Streaming of Content
Consumer tastes and preferences:
Another example of the impact of changing consumer tastes and preferences is in the rapidly growing preference for
video-on-demand (VOD) streaming of content. VOD means that viewers can watch a variety of TV programmes, as
well as subscription services and other digital content online.
This includes catch-up TV services such as iView and SBS on Demand. All of the free-to-air TV stations have a
downloadable app, so that viewers can watch content on many types of devices –including computers, tablets and
smartphones.
12
Changing consumer tastes and preferences have contributed to this shift in demand – people want to watch what
they want, when they want it and how they want it.
The Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) reported that in the six months to June 2016, 63% of
adult Australians had content online.
Furthermore, as of July 2016, there were 2.7 million paid SVOD subscriptions in Australia. This means that 2.7
million subscribers joined subscription video services within two years of the launch of such services in Australia.
In fact, 32% of Australians watch SVOD content. Subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix, Stan and
Presto are also relatively low cost, compared to average incomes. For example, a subscriber can access each service’s
whole catalogue of TV and films for $10 a month.
What have these changed consumer preferences meant for entertainment markets in Australia?
As a consequence of changing preferences, there has been a gradual decline in free-to-air TV viewing, and particularly at
the time of broadcast.
As keen students of economics, you will be aware that resources have been reallocated into those markets where
consumers have shown increased preference (demand) for products.
Traffic to iView doubles roughly every 18 months, and the service continues to command an ever growing proportion of
the ABC budget to keep it up and running.
On the other hand, forecasts from ACMA indicate that SVOD paid subscribers will overtake the number of Foxtel
subscribers by 2019, as Foxtel is a relatively more expensive option. (In order to compete, Foxtel has also been forced to
offer a simpler version of its service- Foxtel Play – with subscriptions starting at $10 month.)
The increasing popularity of SVOD services has also seen the end of other Australian online video-on-demand services.
Quickflix went into administration in early 2016, following on from the closure of locally owned on-demand service
EzyFlix in August 2015.
The ready and cheap availability of complementary products- such as unlimited data packages from telecommunications
providers – has also driven demand for SVOD services.
In addition, the devices required to access SVOD services – computers, mobile devices, Apple TVs, Google’s Chromecast,
and Smart TVs – have all been falling in price.

The nature of and conditions for a perfectly competitive market
There are very few markets in Australia that meet the preconditions for being a perfectly competitive market – namely,
the market has a large number of buyers and sellers such that no buyer or seller has the power to influence price, the
products being sold are largely identical and easy to substitute for each other (homogenous), and it is easy to enter and
leave the market when profit opportunities exist, because there are low set up costs.
Reasons the introduction of Uber makes the ride sharing industry closer to perfect competition:
Until the arrival of the ride sharing service, UberX in April 2014, the market for point-to-point passenger travel (the
taxi market) showed characteristics of a monopoly or duopoly– a very small number of providers dominated the
market.
In Victoria, that was 13Cabs and Silvertop Taxis. To provide services, a driver would have to purchase a taxi license
(which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each) and register with one of the two taxi companies. Fares (prices)
were largely unresponsive to demand.
As mentioned earlier, UberX is a ridesharing service using a mobile application that connects passengers to willing
private drivers. It provides a service similar to a taxi.
The Uber Corporation provides the app and overseas the services, but ultimately the drivers are working for
themselves. This type of service is often referred to as ‘point-to-point’ passenger travel.
The arrival of UberX has transformed the market for point-to-point passenger travel – and had the effect of increasing
the level of competition in the market, such that it now more closely resembles perfect competition.
Reasons the market now resembles perfect competition
i. Low barriers to entry:
Drivers can register with UberX without significant barriers to entry. They must possess a valid driver’s licence and a
registered, roadworthy vehicle, and pass a basic background check, but generally the set-up costs are relatively low,
and hence the barriers to entry (and exit) in the market have been reduced.
ii. Lots of buyers and sellers and increased homogeneity
The arrival of Uber on the global market has led to the emergence of other ride sharing platforms – including Lyft,
DiDi Kuaidi (China’s largest lift sharing service) and Ingog
These services have begun to imitate each other, such that increasingly the product being offered is becoming more
homogenous.
In addition, as the product offered by ride sharing services becomes similar, the companies are increasingly competing
on price - bidding each other’s prices down – just as we would expect in a more competitive market.
17
As the popularity and profile of UberX has increased in Australia, larger and larger number of individuals have signed
up to offer their service as Uber drivers and more and more consumers have become UberX customers.
Figures from an Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal survey in February 2015 found around one in 10
Sydneysiders had used ride-sharing services. This has meant the market further replicates another condition of perfect
competition – a large number of buyers and sellers.
iii.Perfect information
A rating system for drivers and riders (passengers) of UberX has contributed to transparency in the market, and
improved the level of information for both participants in the transaction.
In economics, we refer to this as reducing the information asymmetries in the market, or increasing the degree to
which ‘perfect information’ exists in the market.
Once again, this has helped both consumers (passengers) and producers (drivers) to make more efficient decisions and
results in a more competitive market.
iv.Surge pricing (Demand and supply determine prices)
One further key feature of ride sharing services which replicates the predicted conditions and consequences of a
perfectly competitive market is the use of ‘surge pricing.
’
During periods of peak demand, the prices for rides charged by Uber increase substantially. For example, prior to New
Year’s Eve 2016, Uber warned that there would be an increase in prices of its services.
As an Uber spokesperson said at the time ‘During times of peak demand - on New Year’s Eve that’s around between
midnight and 3am, fares increase via an algorithm to help ensure a driver is always nearby and you can get a ride if you
need one.
’
According to economic theory this should work – an increase in the price of a product will lead to an increase in supply
of that product, without any other changes in supply conditions for the product. On a D/S diagram, this would be
represented by an expansion along the existing supply curve.
Competitive Markets and Efficiency
i. Market structures refers to the way particular industries are structured/ organised in terms of the number of firms,
degree of competition, level of efficiency and ease of entry and exit into the market etc.
ii. Perfect competition – Many buyers and sellers with perfect information meaning firms are price takers, homogenous
products (Explain what this means), firms can enter and exit the market freely (No large exit fees), licences or set up
costs, all buyers and sellers have perfect information and all resources are mobile
iii. If a perfectly competitive market is making abnormal profits new competitors enter the market and force prices down
until firms only make normal profits (This may not be the case with oligopolies
iv. Perfect markets are generally the most efficient because
- Resources will be allocated to areas of societies best interest (Consumer sovereignty) in the right quantities (No body
has the power to restrict supply – Allocative efficiency), competition ensure businesses strive to be as technically
efficient as possible to stay competitive
- Businesses must invest in new technology and better production techniques to remain competitive), factor mobility
ensures dynamic and allocative efficiency, suppliers need to pay close attention to price signals or you can become
uncompetitive
v. More concentrated markets like monopolies are less efficient because
- A lack of competition amongst suppliers can lead to businesses abusing their power and charging excessive prices
(Price makers), producers can restrict output leading to under allocation of resources to certain areas valued by society
(Less allocative efficiency, decreasing NMLS)
- Consumers have little choice but to buy the product from them leading to reduced allocative efficiency– May not use
the best production techniques or inputs as there is less pressure to cut costs (Technical efficiency).
18
Competitive markets and efficiency
Key features (Must be explained in detail)– Many buyers and sellers (Price takers), homogenous products, ease of entry and exit, perfect information, mobile resources, buyers and
sellers are rational and aim to maximise their well-being, consumer sovereignty dictates resource allocation and only normal profits are made
Competitive markets and allocative efficiency
Competitive markets and technical efficiency
Definition - The combination of goods and services (Produced and consumed)
which achieves the highest level of collective satisfaction for a society.
Definition- Technical efficiency is the effectiveness with which a given set of inputs is used to produce an
output. A firm is said to be technically efficient if a firm is producing the maximum output from the
minimum quantity of inputs, such as labour, capital and technology.
Reasons free markets promote allocative efficiency
Reasons free markets promote technical efficiency
i. Producers pay close attention to price signals and therefore meet
consumers demand – Shortage, increased prices, higher profits etc.
There is a discipline to seek the least cost method of production (Because products are very
similar and only competing on price)
ii. Production is not constrained when there is high demand (No
barriers to entry) so they produce enough and meet demand
ii. Great incentive to keep expenses down and reduce waste
Prices are lower due to competition and incentive to invest in better
production techniques, minimise waste and boost productivity
(Increased MLS)
Firms are always looking for better production techniques, better management practices and
ways to more effectively utilise technology
Improving productivity means existing resources can achieve high production volumes
Factor mobility ensure resources are quickly switched to meet
consumer’s needs (Dynamic efficiency)
This boosts allocative efficiency as products are cheaper and consumers have more choice
(Maximising welfare)
iii. iv. i. iii. iv. v. Competitive markets and dynamic efficiency
Dynamic efficiency– The ability of an economic system to move to a new allocatively
efficient point following a change in conditions of demand and/or supply. How quickly the
market responds to changes in relative prices by reallocating resources into the now relatively
more profitable (More desired) areas of production.
Reasons free markets promote dynamic efficiency
i. In competitive markets the movement to the new equilibrium prices happens quickly.
ii. Suppliers constantly monitor price changes to maximise their profits and move
resources as quickly as possible to areas of production that are the most profitable.
iii. Resources are mobile and can be substituted into different areas of production because
of low set up costs making it easier to shift resources into profitable areas.
iv. Demand will often be met because new competitors will enter the market as the relative
price of a product increases (Unlike in some other markets where it can be difficult for
new companies to enter the market).
v. Firms will constantly change the types of products they produce if it is in their best
interest/ if it’s profitable.
Competitive markets and inter-temporal efficiency
Definition- Achieving a balance between current and future levels of societal satisfaction. If
we achieving inter-temporal efficiency the living standards of future generations should not be
jeopardised by the current generation.
Pro’s and con’s of free markets for inter-temporal efficiency
Pro - If there is excessive spending and not enough saving the ‘Money market’ may
experience a shortage of funds for investment (Not enough money for borrowing).
Demand for funds will outweigh supply leading to a shortage and increased interest rates
helping to rebalance the level of spending in the economy (Encouraging savings and
discouraging spending due to the higher opportunity cost associated with spending).
Con – Essential infrastructure can be neglected
Con – People value the present more than the future leading to sustainability issues. Relative
prices don’t always reflect the true costs and benefits of products.
Products with ‘Negative externalities’ like coal based electricity may be overproduced if they
are more profitable for firms causing climate change (Harming future generations)
19
i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. Market Failure
Definition of market failure - When the unregulated market is unable to allocate resources to maximise welfare or living
standards of society. When the price system, self-interest and consumer sovereignty are unsuccessful or inefficient in directing
resources into areas that promote the public interest (Allocative efficiency not achieved – Net benefits not maximised)
Four types of market failure you need to be aware of – Externalities (Positive and negative), public goods, asymmetric
information and common access resources
You also need to be aware of how the government intervenes to prevent or limit the impact of each of the 4 market failures
Characteristics of public goods (Non-excludable and non-rivalrous), why public goods and under allocated in a free market
(The free rider effect), examples, the Government solution to the inefficient allocation is to provide the public good at
approximately the level that the population values it with taxpayers money.
Definitions of both positive and negative externalities - Externalities arise when a person is engaged in a transaction (or
activity) that affects the wellbeing of a third party who is not involved in the transaction or activity.
They can be positive or negative and can occur in production or consumption. Producers and consumers often ignore these
third party externalities leading to an inefficient market
Externalities create a divergence between the private and social costs or benefits of production. Social cost includes all the
costs of production and the third party (external) costs arising, for example, from pollution of the atmosphere.

ix. x. xi. xii. xiii. xiv. xv. xvi. How the government intervene to prevent negative externalities - Governments use their power to regulate the market and
use taxes to affect relative prices – Taxes aim is to force the producer or consumer to internalise (pay for) the external cost
that has been imposed on a third party (Make private cost = social cost. Higher prices will generally decrease demand, shift
demand to substitutes that have smaller external costs
Other ways to prevent negative externalities – Age identification, licences, laws, government inspectors
Positive externalities - This occurs when the consumption or production of a good causes a benefit to a third party. In free
markets producers often under-allocate resources to areas where there are positive third party externalities
Merit Goods: Some goods and services are highly desirable. It is felt that all people should have access to them, and as such
even though they are provided by the free market the total level of demand is not satisfied E.g. Schools, Hospitals, Libraries
The government can help provide merit goods like education via – Subsidies, direct production, research
grants, minimum school leaving ages, legislation to ensure sufficient resources are allocated to these areas
Asymmetric information occurs when one party to a transaction has more information about the good or service (Occurs
when a consumer or supplier cannot gain full information about a product) leading to an inefficient allocation of resources-
It can lead to adverse selection and moral hazard
Hidden action is when one person in a transaction can act in a way that cannot be observed by the other party. Hidden
Characteristics occur when one side of the market knows more than the other about the product’s characteristics that are
relevant to the transaction.
Adverse selection occurs when one party knows more about the product than the other does. Thus the uninformed party may
therefore purchase adversely, resulting in an over or under allocation of resources to the production of that good or service. It
happens in the used car market and can lead to an over-allocation of resources to poor second hand cars and
under-allocation of resources to quality second hand cars
20
xvii. xviii. xix. i. Moral hazard is when economic agents adjust their behaviour to one that is less efficient from society
’s point of view due to
unobservable actions.
E.g. Health Insurance, Drivers, Workers, Banks. It leads to a change in incentives and a decrease in the efficiency of resource
allocation. It can also lead to safe drivers having to pay more for car insurance that they should because insurance companies
need to cover the extra claims of unsafe drivers, driving recklessly because they have insurance.
The private sector can help prevent asymmetric information via screening and signalling, independent reviews using the
internet and removing unfair dismissal laws (Preventing the principal agent problem)
The government can help prevent asymmetric information via - Trade practices legislation (Consumer
Law) preventing misleading and deceptive conduct ($250,000 fine), laws relating to warranties and
defective products, product disclosures and employment and contract laws that provide protection to
employers and employees that may face principal/agent problems (6 month trial periods, individual
contracts, removal of unfair dismissal laws)
Government Failure
Government failure occurs when governments intervene in the free operation of markets and in doing so cause inefficiencies,
reducing the satisfaction of society
’s needs and wants and lowering living standards. They make mistakes and reduce competition
Identify what is meant by the term government failure and explain one example of how government
intervention in the market can unintentionally lead to a less efficient allocation of resources (4 marks)
MINIMUM WAGES
Government failure is a situation where government intervention fails to improve the allocation of resources or actually
makes the allocation of resources less efficient compared to the free market outcome. Gov
’t failure can arise because it was
unnecessary for the gov
’t to intervene and their actions have led to a distortion of the price mechanism unnecessarily to alter
the allocation of resources in such a manner that it has reduced society
’s overall satisfaction
An efficient allocation of resources in the economy requires that all resources (e.g. labour and capital) are used in
combinations and applications such that national welfare is at a maximum.
The minimum wage is designed to protect workers with weak bargaining power from exploitation in the workforce. It is a
safety net so those on the minimum wage are above the poverty line and can afford basic goods and services.
The minimum wage however, can lead to undesirable consequences including the fact that many markets will not be in
equilibrium. When the minimum wage is set above the market clearing wage labour supply is greater than labour demand
which leads to unemployment in many industries. This is an inefficient allocation of resources as valuable labour is not being
utilised in the production process. This will lead to a country working inside its PPF and the maximum volume of production
and satisfaction cannot be achieved (Reducing technical and allocative efficiency).
Higher minimum wages can also reduce the gap between wages in high and low skilled professions covered by the minimum
wage which can lead to relative wages not being reflective of market conditions. This could potentially cause an under
allocation of scarce labour resources to certain profession because the relatively higher wage does not justify the extra
training or effort. This could lead to a more uneducated workforce and a drop in technical efficiency.
SUBSIDIES AND PROTECTIONISM
A government subsidy can unintentionally penalise other producers for a number of reasons. For example, the subsidy to
Alcoa enables it to bid up the price of resources such as labour and other inputs, which effectively increases the costs of
production for other producers. In addition, to the extent that the subsidies force governments [both state and federal] to
raise (business) taxes in order to fund the subsidy, it once more leads to an increase in the costs of production for other
businesses.
An efficient allocation of resources in the economy requires that all resources (e.g. labour and capital) are used in
combinations and applications such that national welfare is at a maximum. If subsidies are not specifically used to rectify a
market failure (e.g. to promote the production of goods or services with positive externalities in production or consumption)
then they can lead to a less efficient allocation of resources.
In the case of subsidies in general, they have typically led to a less efficient allocation of resources, by diverting resources
away from those industries or activities in which Australia has a comparative advantage (e.g. tourism and education) and
towards those industries (e.g. manufacturing) in which Australia is relatively less [technically] efficient. Like protection more
generally, subsidies worked to protect local firms from the rigours of international competition and allowed many relatively
‘inefficient’ businesses to remain viable. As highlighted in the first paragraph, this penalised other producers, raising their
costs of production and prices, which ultimately led to a misallocation of the nation’s resources and a reduction in economic
(allocative) efficiency.
21
Positive and Negative externalities Most of the information on positive and negative
externalities is above
It is important that you clearly state that the private and
social costs or benefits differ in transactions with
positive or negative externalities
Education is a key positive externality in consumption –
The third party benefits include a more productive
workforce, lower unemployment rates (Helping the
gov’t), lower crime rates, better health outcomes,
increased taxes.
There is an under allocation of resources to education
because consumers don’t receive all these benefits and
in a free market the private cost may outweigh the
private benefit (Even if the social benefit exceeds the
private cost)
Gov’t intervenes – Minimum school leaving age,
subsidising private schools, providing public schools
free of charge to internalise the social benefits
Government intervention
Government regulation
- Laws banning certain activities and making others
mandatory (E.g. Bike helmets), compulsory
education (Shifting demand right), No Jab No Pay
for vaccinations (Stripping childcare subsidies for
those who don’t vaccinate their children)
Advertising (Very important) – Shifts demand
right for pos. externalities and left for neg. ext.
- Programs on healthy eating and staying active to
reduce the number of days lost to sickness and boost
productivity and boosting allocative efficiency,
promotion of cancer screening, Flight Flu campaign,
SunSmart
- QUIT campaigns, black balloon climate change adds
Subsidies for education (HECS help) and R and
D, indirect taxation
Types of Market Failure and government intervention
Asymmetric information
Sometimes the producers or consumer does not possesses full information about a good or service which can lead to a less efficient
allocation of resources
Asymmetric information– A market transaction when one party has access to more information than the other
Seller has more information than buyer – Lemon cars, fake jewellery
Leads to adverse selection– Individuals buys a faulty car (Hurting their welfare – Less allocatively efficient)
- Those with second hand cars hold on to their cars longer than they should because they know they won’t get a fair price for them
- Reputable sellers cannot get a fair price for their second hand car because consumers become more cautious about buying second
hand cars
- Not enough resources are allocated towards good second hand cars
Other situations– Dentists overcharging or undertaking unnecessary procedures to make more money reducing consumers material
living standards and their ability to purchase other goods and services, mechanics over-charging leading to significant transactions costs
as people search for fair/ reasonable mechanics
Buyer has more information than seller
Insurance contracts. Low risk customers effectively subsidise high risk customers
Moral hazard – Consumers change their behaviour in a way that is less efficient for society as the costs are transferred to other parties
- Some healthy citizens or safe drivers don’t get insurance as it is too expensive leading to an under allocation to insurance
services
- Another example is an employment contract (Reduced productivity once you are guaranteed a job)
Market Responses
Signalling - Previous experience, place of education, referees
Screening – Checking resumes for simple errors, psychological tests, hidden cameras, trial periods, performance based pay
Independent reviews – Choice, RACV, the internet, excess for insurance claims
Government responses
Government regulation – Consumer Law banning misleading and deceptive conduct, warranties and refunds are law if products
come with faults, food-labelling laws (Nutrition information),
Government advertising– Making consumers more aware of the benefits of merit goods and the external costs of demerit goods,
health campaigns highlighting the benefits of fruit and vegetables or the risks of smoking

DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can define price elasticity of supply and identify the factors that affect it
CODE: 4.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
Price elasticity of supply (PES) measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price. Key factors affecting PES are: spare capacity (more spare capacity means more elastic), the production period (longer production times mean less elastic), and the durability or storability of the good (storable goods are more elastic as existing stock can be released).

WHY (importance):
PES determines how quickly and fully producers can respond to price changes. This affects how much of a tax is passed on to consumers, how quickly shortages are resolved, and how volatile prices are in different markets.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
The supply of fresh strawberries is inelastic in the short run because farmers cannot instantly grow more crops, even if prices spike. However, the supply of manufactured furniture is more elastic because factories with spare capacity can increase production relatively quickly by running extra shifts.

SUBTOPIC: Price Elasticity of Demand and Supply
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the meaning, measurement, and significance of price elasticity of demand (PED) and price elasticity of supply (PES). It explores the factors that determine whether demand or supply is elastic or inelastic and the implications for producers and policy-makers.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Elasticity determines how much quantity responds to a price change, which has direct implications for business revenue, the effectiveness of government taxes and subsidies, and the speed at which markets adjust. It is a tool that turns basic demand and supply analysis into something far more precise and useful.

Wants Needs Resources/ Factors of Production Mixed Economy Utility
Consumer Sovereignty – It is the ability of the consumer in a competitive market economy to direct or allocate
resources. Producers acting in their own self-interest use their scarce resources to produce what consumers demand
due to the extra dollars they can earn. Higher relative prices act as an incentive for producers to shift their resources
to the production of these goods and services due to higher profits.
i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. ix. Chapter 1 – Fundamental Economic Concepts
A definition of economic and economic activity – Economic activity is the volume (or real value) of production,
employment, incomes and expenditure in an economy
The basic economic problem – All wants and needs are infinite while resources (Land, labour and capital) are finite –
This requires individuals/ businesses and governments to make choices about how to allocate their scarce resources
All resources have competing uses – Labour can be dedicated towards manufacturing, service industries etc
Economics is about how resources are allocated among competing uses - Our resources land labour and capital are finite
or limited and can be used in a range of different ways. For example water is a land resource that can be used for a range
of competing uses including drinking, watering plants, cleaning agriculture etc. As a society we must make choices as to
how we will utilise our scarce resources to maximise living standards this is the goal of an economy.
An efficient allocation of resources is one where societies living standards are maximised, resources
are devoted to areas that will maximise utility and opportunity cost is minimised – Include
opportunity cost in your definition
The four factors of production are land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship and all have competing uses (You need
to be able to explain what these competing uses are – E.g. Labour can be used in various ways. You could become a
teacher, plumber, engineer or lawyer, however, because your time is scarce you need to make choices)
Remember to be considered a factor of production the resource must be used to make goods and services for sale. A
car is not a factor of production if it is simply being used by consumers, however a taxi or a pizza delivery car is being
used to provide a service so it would be considered a factor of production
The three economic questions are what, how and for whom to produce – Australia is a market capitalist economy and
will dedicate resources to areas that are the most profitable using the combination of land and labour that is most
efficient and profitable (Consumer sovereignty mainly dictates how resources are allocated with some government
intervention)
The government intervenes because a private market based on the profit motive would lead to a highly uneven
distribution of resources (Only those with particular skills or land would generate high incomes)
7
x. xi. xii. xiii. xiv. xv. xvi. xvii. xviii. xix. Because resources are scarce and have alternative uses economic actors must make choices. Every choice involves an
opportunity costs (The value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made)
Opportunity costs can be measures in dollars, time or external costs passed on to others
The PPF represents the production possibilities available to an economy producing 2 goods and services. Every point
on the PPF is technically efficient, points inside the PPF symbolise and inefficient allocation or resources (E.G. Idle
labour or capital) while points outside the curve are unobtainable at the current point in time
The PPF is bowed outwards because resources are not equally suited to both types of production and therefore the
opportunity cost increases the more of a good or service that is produced
The PPF is downward sloping because every decision requires a trade-off in terms of the other goods
or service (The opportunity cost)
The PPF will shift inwards if there is a fall in the quantity or quality of productive resources available to an economy
(E.g. A cyclone, drought, emigration etc.), the PPF will shift outwards if there is an increase in the quality or quantity
of resources available to an economy (E.g. Increased immigration, new technology, exploration of natural resources,
foreign investment)
The allocatively efficient point on a PPF is dependent on how much society values different goods and services
(Generally only 1 point on the PPF), dynamic efficiency is about how quickly we can shift resources towards the
allocatively efficient point
We assume all economic actors are rational, have preferences, are subject to budget constraints and think at the
margin
Rational economic actors think at the margin. They way up the net benefits and net costs of any decision and make
decisions based on the net benefits exceeding net cost
The law of diminishing marginal utility states that the more of a good or service that is consumed per period the
smaller the increase in utility that is generated from each additional unit.
Productive Capacity– The point at which production (or GDP) is occurring at the maximum level possible in an
economy (The physical limits of production). The economy is at its physical limit or potential to produce goods and
services and resources are being used to maximum efficiency. Boosting a countries productive capacity over time is
critical to boosting material living standards.
Types of Efficiency
An efficient allocation of resources occurs when the needs and wants of society are maximised. The goods and services that
people want will be produced in the best possible way (waste will be minimised and there is no better way to make the product).
When efficiency is achieved it will be impossible to make someone better off without making someone else worse off, the
opportunity cost is minimised and the goods and services that are produced provide the highest level of collective satisfaction
i. Productive/ technical efficiency- Maximising output per unit of input, achieving the least cost method of
production and minimising the use of resources in production. Obtaining the greatest possible production of goods
and services from available resources (Land, capital and labour used to their full potential). Resources are not wasted
in the production process and an economy is producing the best quality product at the lowest opportunity cost.
ii. Allocative efficiency- ensuring the most efficient allocation of scarce resources in an economy in a sense that
resources are producing the goods and services most valued by society and living standards/ welfare is being
maximized. It is represented by only one point on the PPF. Allocative efficiency is about maximizing technical
efficiency whilst also producing what consumers desire (In both the short and long term). When allocative efficiency
occurs no resources will be wasted and it will be impossible to make someone better off without making someone else
worse off. Any change in the way our resources are allocated will reduce national welfare or living standards.
iii. Dynamic efficiency– Refers to how quickly an economy can reallocate resources to achieve allocative efficiency.
Relates to firms being creative and innovative, adapting to latest technology and upgrading workers skills in response
to changing economic conditions. Is it achieved when businesses can adapt their methods of production and output
quickly in response to changes in market conditions or changes in technology (E.g. from point 1 to point 2)
iv. Inter-temporal efficiency- Achieved when an ideal balance is met between using resources (Firms, gov
’t or
nation) to satisfy needs and wants today but conserving resources for the future also. A balance between resource use
for current use and that of future generations.

How could two countries have different allocatively
efficient points on the PPF (Assuming they are
producing the same two goods and services?
Why does improving technical
efficiency help an economy achieve
allocative efficiency?
Assume an economy is achieving technical efficiency. Explain
with the use of an example how it could achieve a more efficient
allocation of resources without pushing out the PPC
- Define allocative efficiency (Maximising
societies welfare/ wants and needs)
- They may value goods differently
Provide an example
- Define technical efficiency
- Help keeps prices low (Production costs
are lower) so consumers have more
purchasing power (Can meet more of
their wants and needs)
- More goods and services available/
choice
- No idle resources/ unemployment
(Higher incomes)
- Define technical efficiency
- State that higher productivity means higher quantity/ volume of
goods and services
- Also means lower prices if markets are competitive increasing
purchasing power – Higher MLS improving Allocative efficiency
- However technical does not imply we are producing what society
values – Could be producing items nobody wants or those that reduce
living standards
- Provide an example
How can the government and businesses promote technical efficiency within the
economy? E.g. What could they do to make businesses more productive?
Government
- Remove unfair dismissal laws, tax concessions for research and development into new
technology (Businesses pay less tax if they invest)
- Build new infrastructure (New roads), lower tariffs, subsidise training programs
Businesses -Invest in capital and machinery, training, performance based pay
How can the government help
ensure inter-temporal
efficiency?
- Define inter-temporal
efficiency
- Carbon tax
- Subsidising clean energy
- Tax concessions for savings
and investment
What are some ways the gov’t can promote
allocative efficiency
- Lower tariffs
- Taxes on cigarettes/ alcohol
- Banning certain products
- Subsidising health care/ education
(Goods with positive externalities)
How can the government and businesses help increase dynamic
efficiency in the economy?
i. Lower tariffs – So we shift resources to areas of comparative advantage
ii. Multiskilling employees – So they shift labour to areas of high demand
quickly
iii. Removing unfair dismissal laws – So they can sack workers when
preferences change
iv. Deregulating the labour market – Pay based on profitability?
v. Technological advances
vi. Investing in alternative energy
vii. Removing subsidies in uncompetitive industries
How does improving
inter-temporal efficiency help
allocative efficiency
- Preserves living standards/ welfare
for future generations
Provide an example
- Research and development into
new green energy (Less floods etc.)
- Savings are needed for future
investment
- Reducing our level of NFD (Helps
to keep taxes low, interest low in
the future)
Explain why dynamic efficiency is needed to
improve allocative efficiency.
Why dynamic efficiency is important – Because it allows us
to quickly shift resources to where they are demanded
ensuring societies welfare/ living standards are increased
(Higher production of goods/ services in demand) increasing
Allocative efficiency
Example – Mining industry and shift in resources – Higher
wages/ income due to strong overseas demand (Consumer
sovereignty), faster we get resources into mining the better
for the economy – Achieve allocative efficiency
This is why market economies are good at achieving
allocative efficiency for the most part – Due to consumer
sovereignty

Really important definition:
Disposable income – The rewards received by households from their contribution to the production process (income
from working plus income from other productive resources) plus government transfers (for example, pensions and
parenting payments) minus direct taxes (i.e. income tax). It represents the total amount that consumers have to spend on
goods and services.
Chapter 2 notes
Features of perfectly competitive markets:
i. A large number of buyers and sellers with each of them having little influence on price (Sellers are Price takers). No
individual buyer or seller has the market power to influence price
ii. Products are homogenous which means they are virtually identical and easily substitutable. This means that suppliers
who offer products at the lower price will attract customers (There is no branding or product differentiation
distinguishing products)
iii. There is ease of entry and exit into the market. There are low set up costs in the industry which means if there are
profit making opportunities available new competitors can quickly enter the market and undercut existing suppliers.
This means ‘Abnormal or supernormal Profits,
’ cannot be made in the long term (Only normal profits).
Other assumptions of perfectly competitive markets:
i. Resources are mobile and can be moved quickly from one market to another which allows price signals to do their job -
Consumer sovereignty dictates where resources are allocated (High demand for products send signals to producers to
produce certain goods and services)
ii. Perfect information (Full information) in that both the buyer and seller know all the information about the product
being sold and other alternatives available in the market. They can compare prices and make rational/ informed
decisions (There is no asymmetric information which can lead to inefficiency).
iii. Both the buyer and seller seek to maximise their own wellbeing, sellers aim to maximise their profits and the
purchaser aims to maximise their utility or satisfaction
Other key information
i. Market or Price Mechanism – Describes how the forces of demand and supply interact to determine (relative)
prices of goods and services in different markets and ultimately how our productive resources are allocated in the
economy
ii. Consumer sovereignty dictates where resources are allocated in Australia’s market capitalist economy. Profit
motivated businesses will shift resources to areas in high demand as they are the most profitable ‘The invisible hand
of the market.
’
10
iii. Changes in relative prices act as signals to producers to direct resources (Land, labour, capital) to these areas of high
demand
iv. Know the law of demand and law of supply really well – The law of demand states the higher the price of a good or
service the smaller the quantity demanded and vice versa
v. Know the reasons the demand curve slopes downwards (Income effect, substitute effect, law of
diminishing marginal utility – At higher prices consumers will buy less of a good or service)
vi. The key microeconomic demand side factors – Disposable income, consumer preferences/tastes,
price of complements, price of substitutes, population, consumer sentiment, interest rates,
demographic changes and advertising
vii. The difference between normal and inferior goods – There is a decreased demand for inferior goods when consumers
disposable incomes rise
viii. Know the reasons the supply curve slopes upwards – Greater profits available at higher prices, increased opportunity
cost associated with shifting resources to other areas, firms are able to more effectively cover the marginal costs
associated with additional production
ix. The key microeconomic supply side factors – Change in capital costs, changes in the cost of
machinery, productivity, improvements in technology, changes in labour costs, changes to
government laws and regulations (Including indirect taxes), climatic conditions, subsidies, the price
of other products using similar resources
x. How a market gets back to equilibrium if the initial price is set too high or too low – The impact of price ceilings
(Causing shortages) and price floors (Causing surpluses) on markets
xi. Shifting the curves – Remember for a shift in demand to occur consumers must be more or less
willing to demand a good at any given price. For a shift in supply to occur producers must be more or
less willing/ able to supply at any given price
xii. Practice getting a market back to equilibrium after a shift in supply or demand and after a double shift in supply and
demand. Mention the initial shortage/ surplus, the change in price, the contraction and expansions and the new
equilibrium point.
xiii.Also mention the value of any shortages and the initial and new equilibrium price if you are given
figures in a graph
xiv. How each shift will impact the price and quantity demanded of a product
Shift in curve New Equilibrium Price New Equilibrium Quantity
Demand Shifts Right Demand shifts left Higher price Lower Price Higher Quantity
Lower quantity
Supply shifts right Lower price Higher quantity
Supply shifts left Higher price Lower quantity
xv. xvi. Some factors that will shift both curves – Changes in oil prices for cars, advertising, changes in interest rates, changes
in the value of the AUD
Remember any excise/ indirect taxes shift supply left not demand left
xvii. Tricky table – Be really careful about what causes a shift vs. a contraction or expansion in
demand and supply
A shift in the demand curve to
the right causes
Impact on demand A contraction in demand - due to the
higher price
Impact on supply
An expansion in supply – Due to the

xviii. A PED of less than 1 means that demand is inelastic (Elasticity measures the responsiveness of demand to a change
in price)
xix. Revise what is meant by elastic and inelastic demand curves and the fact that a lower price will boost revenue if a
good is ELASTIC and vice versa
xx. Revise the factors that impact elasticity of demand – Degree of necessity, number of substitutes,
time, cost and relative importance (Percentage of income), minor complementary product
xxi. The price of petrol fell significantly in 2015. With reference to the concept of elasticity explain the
impact lower petrol prices are likely to have on household budgets in 2015
Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the percentage change in quantity demanded resulting from a given
percentage change in price. Petrol is generally associated with a low PED because petrol is deemed by consumers and
households to be a necessity with few substitutes.
Lower prices for petrol will not generally result in consumers choosing to drive their car further or more frequently
(because demand is price inelastic), so the total amount spent on petrol is likely to fall. Therefore, lower prices will free up
more of the weekly household budget for savings or other discretionary purchasing decisions, possibly improving the
material living standards of Australian households.
xxii. Revise the factors that impact elasticity of supply – Storability/ perishability, spare capacity/
resource mobility, time
xxiii. Remember that even if a good is INELASTIC the quantity demanded will still change when the price changes – The
proportional change in price will just be greater than the proportional change in demand
xxiv. Spend lots of time on relative prices – Relative prices refer to the price of one good or service in terms of the price
of another good or service
xxv. Key words – Forces of demand and supply, profit motive, price signals, consumer sovereignty,
resources (Land, labour and capital)
xxvi. ALL RELATIVE PRICE ANSWERS MUST USE EXAMPLES TO SHOW HOW RESOURCES SHIFT!
xxvii. Factors causing a change in relative prices – Advertising, fashion tastes, unfavourable supply side conditions, taxes,
demographic changes, tariffs, government assistance (Subsidies)
xxviii. Remember producers will shift resources to areas where there is higher relative profits not higher
relative prices – If higher prices are caused by poor supply side conditions resources will move out
of that industry
xxix. Use the mining boom to show how resources shift from one industry to another in response to
changing prices - More resources were allocated to expanding existing mines and building new mines (Capital
resources reallocated to mining and away from other forms of investment) – Capital reallocated. It also lead to the
reallocation of labour to the mining sector (Builders, surveyors, engineers, truck drivers. IT specialists quickly
applied for jobs and moved to W.A.)
xxx. Relative prices determine how to produce – Producers will use the combination of land and capital that is most cost
effective
xxxi. For whom to produce is determined by people’s relative wages determining their access to goods and services
From CPAP Study Guide: Examples of factors changing relative prices (VOD) Streaming of Content
Consumer tastes and preferences:
Another example of the impact of changing consumer tastes and preferences is in the rapidly growing preference for
video-on-demand (VOD) streaming of content. VOD means that viewers can watch a variety of TV programmes, as
well as subscription services and other digital content online.
This includes catch-up TV services such as iView and SBS on Demand. All of the free-to-air TV stations have a
downloadable app, so that viewers can watch content on many types of devices –including computers, tablets and
smartphones.
12
Changing consumer tastes and preferences have contributed to this shift in demand – people want to watch what
they want, when they want it and how they want it.
The Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) reported that in the six months to June 2016, 63% of
adult Australians had content online.
Furthermore, as of July 2016, there were 2.7 million paid SVOD subscriptions in Australia. This means that 2.7
million subscribers joined subscription video services within two years of the launch of such services in Australia.
In fact, 32% of Australians watch SVOD content. Subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix, Stan and
Presto are also relatively low cost, compared to average incomes. For example, a subscriber can access each service’s
whole catalogue of TV and films for $10 a month.
What have these changed consumer preferences meant for entertainment markets in Australia?
As a consequence of changing preferences, there has been a gradual decline in free-to-air TV viewing, and particularly at
the time of broadcast.
As keen students of economics, you will be aware that resources have been reallocated into those markets where
consumers have shown increased preference (demand) for products.
Traffic to iView doubles roughly every 18 months, and the service continues to command an ever growing proportion of
the ABC budget to keep it up and running.
On the other hand, forecasts from ACMA indicate that SVOD paid subscribers will overtake the number of Foxtel
subscribers by 2019, as Foxtel is a relatively more expensive option. (In order to compete, Foxtel has also been forced to
offer a simpler version of its service- Foxtel Play – with subscriptions starting at $10 month.)
The increasing popularity of SVOD services has also seen the end of other Australian online video-on-demand services.
Quickflix went into administration in early 2016, following on from the closure of locally owned on-demand service
EzyFlix in August 2015.
The ready and cheap availability of complementary products- such as unlimited data packages from telecommunications
providers – has also driven demand for SVOD services.
In addition, the devices required to access SVOD services – computers, mobile devices, Apple TVs, Google’s Chromecast,
and Smart TVs – have all been falling in price.

The nature of and conditions for a perfectly competitive market
There are very few markets in Australia that meet the preconditions for being a perfectly competitive market – namely,
the market has a large number of buyers and sellers such that no buyer or seller has the power to influence price, the
products being sold are largely identical and easy to substitute for each other (homogenous), and it is easy to enter and
leave the market when profit opportunities exist, because there are low set up costs.
Reasons the introduction of Uber makes the ride sharing industry closer to perfect competition:
Until the arrival of the ride sharing service, UberX in April 2014, the market for point-to-point passenger travel (the
taxi market) showed characteristics of a monopoly or duopoly– a very small number of providers dominated the
market.
In Victoria, that was 13Cabs and Silvertop Taxis. To provide services, a driver would have to purchase a taxi license
(which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each) and register with one of the two taxi companies. Fares (prices)
were largely unresponsive to demand.
As mentioned earlier, UberX is a ridesharing service using a mobile application that connects passengers to willing
private drivers. It provides a service similar to a taxi.
The Uber Corporation provides the app and overseas the services, but ultimately the drivers are working for
themselves. This type of service is often referred to as ‘point-to-point’ passenger travel.
The arrival of UberX has transformed the market for point-to-point passenger travel – and had the effect of increasing
the level of competition in the market, such that it now more closely resembles perfect competition.
Reasons the market now resembles perfect competition
i. Low barriers to entry:
Drivers can register with UberX without significant barriers to entry. They must possess a valid driver’s licence and a
registered, roadworthy vehicle, and pass a basic background check, but generally the set-up costs are relatively low,
and hence the barriers to entry (and exit) in the market have been reduced.
ii. Lots of buyers and sellers and increased homogeneity
The arrival of Uber on the global market has led to the emergence of other ride sharing platforms – including Lyft,
DiDi Kuaidi (China’s largest lift sharing service) and Ingog
These services have begun to imitate each other, such that increasingly the product being offered is becoming more
homogenous.
In addition, as the product offered by ride sharing services becomes similar, the companies are increasingly competing
on price - bidding each other’s prices down – just as we would expect in a more competitive market.
17
As the popularity and profile of UberX has increased in Australia, larger and larger number of individuals have signed
up to offer their service as Uber drivers and more and more consumers have become UberX customers.
Figures from an Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal survey in February 2015 found around one in 10
Sydneysiders had used ride-sharing services. This has meant the market further replicates another condition of perfect
competition – a large number of buyers and sellers.
iii.Perfect information
A rating system for drivers and riders (passengers) of UberX has contributed to transparency in the market, and
improved the level of information for both participants in the transaction.
In economics, we refer to this as reducing the information asymmetries in the market, or increasing the degree to
which ‘perfect information’ exists in the market.
Once again, this has helped both consumers (passengers) and producers (drivers) to make more efficient decisions and
results in a more competitive market.
iv.Surge pricing (Demand and supply determine prices)
One further key feature of ride sharing services which replicates the predicted conditions and consequences of a
perfectly competitive market is the use of ‘surge pricing.
’
During periods of peak demand, the prices for rides charged by Uber increase substantially. For example, prior to New
Year’s Eve 2016, Uber warned that there would be an increase in prices of its services.
As an Uber spokesperson said at the time ‘During times of peak demand - on New Year’s Eve that’s around between
midnight and 3am, fares increase via an algorithm to help ensure a driver is always nearby and you can get a ride if you
need one.
’
According to economic theory this should work – an increase in the price of a product will lead to an increase in supply
of that product, without any other changes in supply conditions for the product. On a D/S diagram, this would be
represented by an expansion along the existing supply curve.
Competitive Markets and Efficiency
i. Market structures refers to the way particular industries are structured/ organised in terms of the number of firms,
degree of competition, level of efficiency and ease of entry and exit into the market etc.
ii. Perfect competition – Many buyers and sellers with perfect information meaning firms are price takers, homogenous
products (Explain what this means), firms can enter and exit the market freely (No large exit fees), licences or set up
costs, all buyers and sellers have perfect information and all resources are mobile
iii. If a perfectly competitive market is making abnormal profits new competitors enter the market and force prices down
until firms only make normal profits (This may not be the case with oligopolies
iv. Perfect markets are generally the most efficient because
- Resources will be allocated to areas of societies best interest (Consumer sovereignty) in the right quantities (No body
has the power to restrict supply – Allocative efficiency), competition ensure businesses strive to be as technically
efficient as possible to stay competitive
- Businesses must invest in new technology and better production techniques to remain competitive), factor mobility
ensures dynamic and allocative efficiency, suppliers need to pay close attention to price signals or you can become
uncompetitive
v. More concentrated markets like monopolies are less efficient because
- A lack of competition amongst suppliers can lead to businesses abusing their power and charging excessive prices
(Price makers), producers can restrict output leading to under allocation of resources to certain areas valued by society
(Less allocative efficiency, decreasing NMLS)
- Consumers have little choice but to buy the product from them leading to reduced allocative efficiency– May not use
the best production techniques or inputs as there is less pressure to cut costs (Technical efficiency).
18
Competitive markets and efficiency
Key features (Must be explained in detail)– Many buyers and sellers (Price takers), homogenous products, ease of entry and exit, perfect information, mobile resources, buyers and
sellers are rational and aim to maximise their well-being, consumer sovereignty dictates resource allocation and only normal profits are made
Competitive markets and allocative efficiency
Competitive markets and technical efficiency
Definition - The combination of goods and services (Produced and consumed)
which achieves the highest level of collective satisfaction for a society.
Definition- Technical efficiency is the effectiveness with which a given set of inputs is used to produce an
output. A firm is said to be technically efficient if a firm is producing the maximum output from the
minimum quantity of inputs, such as labour, capital and technology.
Reasons free markets promote allocative efficiency
Reasons free markets promote technical efficiency
i. Producers pay close attention to price signals and therefore meet
consumers demand – Shortage, increased prices, higher profits etc.
There is a discipline to seek the least cost method of production (Because products are very
similar and only competing on price)
ii. Production is not constrained when there is high demand (No
barriers to entry) so they produce enough and meet demand
ii. Great incentive to keep expenses down and reduce waste
Prices are lower due to competition and incentive to invest in better
production techniques, minimise waste and boost productivity
(Increased MLS)
Firms are always looking for better production techniques, better management practices and
ways to more effectively utilise technology
Improving productivity means existing resources can achieve high production volumes
Factor mobility ensure resources are quickly switched to meet
consumer’s needs (Dynamic efficiency)
This boosts allocative efficiency as products are cheaper and consumers have more choice
(Maximising welfare)
iii. iv. i. iii. iv. v. Competitive markets and dynamic efficiency
Dynamic efficiency– The ability of an economic system to move to a new allocatively
efficient point following a change in conditions of demand and/or supply. How quickly the
market responds to changes in relative prices by reallocating resources into the now relatively
more profitable (More desired) areas of production.
Reasons free markets promote dynamic efficiency
i. In competitive markets the movement to the new equilibrium prices happens quickly.
ii. Suppliers constantly monitor price changes to maximise their profits and move
resources as quickly as possible to areas of production that are the most profitable.
iii. Resources are mobile and can be substituted into different areas of production because
of low set up costs making it easier to shift resources into profitable areas.
iv. Demand will often be met because new competitors will enter the market as the relative
price of a product increases (Unlike in some other markets where it can be difficult for
new companies to enter the market).
v. Firms will constantly change the types of products they produce if it is in their best
interest/ if it’s profitable.
Competitive markets and inter-temporal efficiency
Definition- Achieving a balance between current and future levels of societal satisfaction. If
we achieving inter-temporal efficiency the living standards of future generations should not be
jeopardised by the current generation.
Pro’s and con’s of free markets for inter-temporal efficiency
Pro - If there is excessive spending and not enough saving the ‘Money market’ may
experience a shortage of funds for investment (Not enough money for borrowing).
Demand for funds will outweigh supply leading to a shortage and increased interest rates
helping to rebalance the level of spending in the economy (Encouraging savings and
discouraging spending due to the higher opportunity cost associated with spending).
Con – Essential infrastructure can be neglected
Con – People value the present more than the future leading to sustainability issues. Relative
prices don’t always reflect the true costs and benefits of products.
Products with ‘Negative externalities’ like coal based electricity may be overproduced if they
are more profitable for firms causing climate change (Harming future generations)
19
i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. Market Failure
Definition of market failure - When the unregulated market is unable to allocate resources to maximise welfare or living
standards of society. When the price system, self-interest and consumer sovereignty are unsuccessful or inefficient in directing
resources into areas that promote the public interest (Allocative efficiency not achieved – Net benefits not maximised)
Four types of market failure you need to be aware of – Externalities (Positive and negative), public goods, asymmetric
information and common access resources
You also need to be aware of how the government intervenes to prevent or limit the impact of each of the 4 market failures
Characteristics of public goods (Non-excludable and non-rivalrous), why public goods and under allocated in a free market
(The free rider effect), examples, the Government solution to the inefficient allocation is to provide the public good at
approximately the level that the population values it with taxpayers money.
Definitions of both positive and negative externalities - Externalities arise when a person is engaged in a transaction (or
activity) that affects the wellbeing of a third party who is not involved in the transaction or activity.
They can be positive or negative and can occur in production or consumption. Producers and consumers often ignore these
third party externalities leading to an inefficient market
Externalities create a divergence between the private and social costs or benefits of production. Social cost includes all the
costs of production and the third party (external) costs arising, for example, from pollution of the atmosphere.

ix. x. xi. xii. xiii. xiv. xv. xvi. How the government intervene to prevent negative externalities - Governments use their power to regulate the market and
use taxes to affect relative prices – Taxes aim is to force the producer or consumer to internalise (pay for) the external cost
that has been imposed on a third party (Make private cost = social cost. Higher prices will generally decrease demand, shift
demand to substitutes that have smaller external costs
Other ways to prevent negative externalities – Age identification, licences, laws, government inspectors
Positive externalities - This occurs when the consumption or production of a good causes a benefit to a third party. In free
markets producers often under-allocate resources to areas where there are positive third party externalities
Merit Goods: Some goods and services are highly desirable. It is felt that all people should have access to them, and as such
even though they are provided by the free market the total level of demand is not satisfied E.g. Schools, Hospitals, Libraries
The government can help provide merit goods like education via – Subsidies, direct production, research
grants, minimum school leaving ages, legislation to ensure sufficient resources are allocated to these areas
Asymmetric information occurs when one party to a transaction has more information about the good or service (Occurs
when a consumer or supplier cannot gain full information about a product) leading to an inefficient allocation of resources-
It can lead to adverse selection and moral hazard
Hidden action is when one person in a transaction can act in a way that cannot be observed by the other party. Hidden
Characteristics occur when one side of the market knows more than the other about the product’s characteristics that are
relevant to the transaction.
Adverse selection occurs when one party knows more about the product than the other does. Thus the uninformed party may
therefore purchase adversely, resulting in an over or under allocation of resources to the production of that good or service. It
happens in the used car market and can lead to an over-allocation of resources to poor second hand cars and
under-allocation of resources to quality second hand cars
20
xvii. xviii. xix. i. Moral hazard is when economic agents adjust their behaviour to one that is less efficient from society
’s point of view due to
unobservable actions.
E.g. Health Insurance, Drivers, Workers, Banks. It leads to a change in incentives and a decrease in the efficiency of resource
allocation. It can also lead to safe drivers having to pay more for car insurance that they should because insurance companies
need to cover the extra claims of unsafe drivers, driving recklessly because they have insurance.
The private sector can help prevent asymmetric information via screening and signalling, independent reviews using the
internet and removing unfair dismissal laws (Preventing the principal agent problem)
The government can help prevent asymmetric information via - Trade practices legislation (Consumer
Law) preventing misleading and deceptive conduct ($250,000 fine), laws relating to warranties and
defective products, product disclosures and employment and contract laws that provide protection to
employers and employees that may face principal/agent problems (6 month trial periods, individual
contracts, removal of unfair dismissal laws)
Government Failure
Government failure occurs when governments intervene in the free operation of markets and in doing so cause inefficiencies,
reducing the satisfaction of society
’s needs and wants and lowering living standards. They make mistakes and reduce competition
Identify what is meant by the term government failure and explain one example of how government
intervention in the market can unintentionally lead to a less efficient allocation of resources (4 marks)
MINIMUM WAGES
Government failure is a situation where government intervention fails to improve the allocation of resources or actually
makes the allocation of resources less efficient compared to the free market outcome. Gov
’t failure can arise because it was
unnecessary for the gov
’t to intervene and their actions have led to a distortion of the price mechanism unnecessarily to alter
the allocation of resources in such a manner that it has reduced society
’s overall satisfaction
An efficient allocation of resources in the economy requires that all resources (e.g. labour and capital) are used in
combinations and applications such that national welfare is at a maximum.
The minimum wage is designed to protect workers with weak bargaining power from exploitation in the workforce. It is a
safety net so those on the minimum wage are above the poverty line and can afford basic goods and services.
The minimum wage however, can lead to undesirable consequences including the fact that many markets will not be in
equilibrium. When the minimum wage is set above the market clearing wage labour supply is greater than labour demand
which leads to unemployment in many industries. This is an inefficient allocation of resources as valuable labour is not being
utilised in the production process. This will lead to a country working inside its PPF and the maximum volume of production
and satisfaction cannot be achieved (Reducing technical and allocative efficiency).
Higher minimum wages can also reduce the gap between wages in high and low skilled professions covered by the minimum
wage which can lead to relative wages not being reflective of market conditions. This could potentially cause an under
allocation of scarce labour resources to certain profession because the relatively higher wage does not justify the extra
training or effort. This could lead to a more uneducated workforce and a drop in technical efficiency.
SUBSIDIES AND PROTECTIONISM
A government subsidy can unintentionally penalise other producers for a number of reasons. For example, the subsidy to
Alcoa enables it to bid up the price of resources such as labour and other inputs, which effectively increases the costs of
production for other producers. In addition, to the extent that the subsidies force governments [both state and federal] to
raise (business) taxes in order to fund the subsidy, it once more leads to an increase in the costs of production for other
businesses.
An efficient allocation of resources in the economy requires that all resources (e.g. labour and capital) are used in
combinations and applications such that national welfare is at a maximum. If subsidies are not specifically used to rectify a
market failure (e.g. to promote the production of goods or services with positive externalities in production or consumption)
then they can lead to a less efficient allocation of resources.
In the case of subsidies in general, they have typically led to a less efficient allocation of resources, by diverting resources
away from those industries or activities in which Australia has a comparative advantage (e.g. tourism and education) and
towards those industries (e.g. manufacturing) in which Australia is relatively less [technically] efficient. Like protection more
generally, subsidies worked to protect local firms from the rigours of international competition and allowed many relatively
‘inefficient’ businesses to remain viable. As highlighted in the first paragraph, this penalised other producers, raising their
costs of production and prices, which ultimately led to a misallocation of the nation’s resources and a reduction in economic
(allocative) efficiency.
21
Positive and Negative externalities Most of the information on positive and negative
externalities is above
It is important that you clearly state that the private and
social costs or benefits differ in transactions with
positive or negative externalities
Education is a key positive externality in consumption –
The third party benefits include a more productive
workforce, lower unemployment rates (Helping the
gov’t), lower crime rates, better health outcomes,
increased taxes.
There is an under allocation of resources to education
because consumers don’t receive all these benefits and
in a free market the private cost may outweigh the
private benefit (Even if the social benefit exceeds the
private cost)
Gov’t intervenes – Minimum school leaving age,
subsidising private schools, providing public schools
free of charge to internalise the social benefits
Government intervention
Government regulation
- Laws banning certain activities and making others
mandatory (E.g. Bike helmets), compulsory
education (Shifting demand right), No Jab No Pay
for vaccinations (Stripping childcare subsidies for
those who don’t vaccinate their children)
Advertising (Very important) – Shifts demand
right for pos. externalities and left for neg. ext.
- Programs on healthy eating and staying active to
reduce the number of days lost to sickness and boost
productivity and boosting allocative efficiency,
promotion of cancer screening, Flight Flu campaign,
SunSmart
- QUIT campaigns, black balloon climate change adds
Subsidies for education (HECS help) and R and
D, indirect taxation
Types of Market Failure and government intervention
Asymmetric information
Sometimes the producers or consumer does not possesses full information about a good or service which can lead to a less efficient
allocation of resources
Asymmetric information– A market transaction when one party has access to more information than the other
Seller has more information than buyer – Lemon cars, fake jewellery
Leads to adverse selection– Individuals buys a faulty car (Hurting their welfare – Less allocatively efficient)
- Those with second hand cars hold on to their cars longer than they should because they know they won’t get a fair price for them
- Reputable sellers cannot get a fair price for their second hand car because consumers become more cautious about buying second
hand cars
- Not enough resources are allocated towards good second hand cars
Other situations– Dentists overcharging or undertaking unnecessary procedures to make more money reducing consumers material
living standards and their ability to purchase other goods and services, mechanics over-charging leading to significant transactions costs
as people search for fair/ reasonable mechanics
Buyer has more information than seller
Insurance contracts. Low risk customers effectively subsidise high risk customers
Moral hazard – Consumers change their behaviour in a way that is less efficient for society as the costs are transferred to other parties
- Some healthy citizens or safe drivers don’t get insurance as it is too expensive leading to an under allocation to insurance
services
- Another example is an employment contract (Reduced productivity once you are guaranteed a job)
Market Responses
Signalling - Previous experience, place of education, referees
Screening – Checking resumes for simple errors, psychological tests, hidden cameras, trial periods, performance based pay
Independent reviews – Choice, RACV, the internet, excess for insurance claims
Government responses
Government regulation – Consumer Law banning misleading and deceptive conduct, warranties and refunds are law if products

TARGET: Break down relationships, make judgments, assess validity.
TEST: Can student compare, contrast, infer, critique, or synthesise?
QUESTION TYPES: Compare/contrast, identify relationships, evaluate claims, infer from data, critique reasoning.
STEMS: "Which conclusion is supported by...", "Compare X and Y...", "The evidence suggests...", "Evaluate the claim that..."
REQUIRE: Multi-step reasoning. May include data, scenarios, or competing claims to evaluate.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
