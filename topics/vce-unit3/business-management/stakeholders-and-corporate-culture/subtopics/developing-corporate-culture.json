  "what": "This subtopic covers the strategies that businesses can use to develop and maintain a positive corporate culture, including mission and values statements, management structures, management styles, policies, people, physical environment, and stories and rituals.",
  "why": "A positive corporate culture does not happen by accident. Managers must deliberately implement strategies to shape culture, and understanding these strategies is essential for proposing and justifying solutions in exam scenarios.",

      "title": "I can describe how mission, vision, and values statements shape corporate culture",
      "code": "6.1",
      "what": "The mission statement defines the purpose of the business. The vision statement sets out its aspirations. The values statement outlines what the business recognises as its core values, such as integrity, honesty, and responsibility. Together, these documents act as the starting point for establishing a desired culture.",
      "why": "These statements provide the foundation upon which all business decisions should align. Without them, employees lack a shared understanding of what the business stands for.",
      "example": "Bunnings' guiding principles — integrity, respect, teamwork, achievement, and innovation — are stated as the keys to its culture and achieving its vision, giving its 50,000+ team members a clear framework for expected behaviour.",

      "version": 1,
      "title": "I can describe how management structures influence corporate culture",
      "code": "6.2",
      "what": "The structure of a business determines how work tasks are divided, who holds authority, and how communication flows. Traditional hierarchical structures have three levels (senior, middle, front-line management). Many businesses have moved to flatter structures through delayering, which increases employee involvement and reduces status distinctions.",
      "why": "Structure shapes daily interactions, decision-making, and communication. A flatter structure tends to promote a more collaborative, participative culture, while a tall hierarchy may reinforce a more formal, top-down culture.",
      "example": "A business that removes a layer of middle management (delayering) may find that employees feel more empowered to contribute ideas, communication improves, and the culture shifts from autocratic to participative.",

      "title": "I can describe how management styles affect corporate culture",
      "code": "6.3",
      "what": "Management styles range from autocratic (task-focused, manager makes decisions alone) to participative (employee-centred, workers contribute to decision-making). A more employee-centred style demonstrates that the business values workers' contributions and builds trust.",
      "why": "The management style adopted by leaders directly shapes the day-to-day experience of employees. It influences motivation, job satisfaction, and whether the real culture matches the official culture.",
      "example": "At Insentra, CEO Ronnie Altit holds weekly '45 minutes with Ronnie' calls where employees can ask questions and chat, demonstrating a participative style that reinforces the company's culture of accessibility and transparency.",

      "version": 1,
      "title": "I can describe how policies reinforce corporate culture",
      "code": "6.4",
      "what": "A policy is a written statement detailing processes, procedures, rules, and regulations for a given situation. Policies establish consistency, set out procedures, recognise rights and obligations, identify how conflicts can be resolved, and ensure compliance with desired behaviours.",
      "why": "Policies translate cultural values into enforceable standards. Without clear policies, cultural expectations remain vague and inconsistently applied.",
      "example": "A business with a 'social media usage' policy that prohibits using Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok during working hours establishes a consistent standard — any employee who breaks the rule faces the same consequence, reinforcing a culture of professionalism.",

      "title": "I can describe how people and diversity contribute to corporate culture",
      "code": "6.5",
      "what": "The culture of a business is reflected in its people. Recruitment policies can create diversity in gender, ethnicity, age, skills, and experience. Having the right people who share or are willing to embrace the business's core values builds a coherent culture. Work-life balance practices also indicate whether the culture is genuinely positive.",
      "why": "Diversity enriches corporate culture by bringing different perspectives and ideas. A business that values its workers both professionally and personally creates stronger engagement and loyalty.",
      "example": "Bunnings is well known for employing people of varying ages, backgrounds, and ability levels, which contributes to a diverse, inclusive culture that reflects the communities it serves.",

      "title": "I can describe how the physical environment and material symbols indicate corporate culture",
      "code": "6.6",
      "what": "Physical environment includes office layout (e.g. open-plan vs. closed offices), business location, and design choices. Material symbols such as office size differences between managers, separate cafeterias, staff uniforms, and office colour schemes all communicate aspects of culture.",
      "why": "The physical environment provides immediate, visible cues about what a business values. Open-plan offices signal collaboration, while large executive offices and separate facilities signal hierarchy and status.",
      "example": "At Moose Toys, employees are encouraged to scribble ideas on whiteboard walls and there is a 'no lunch at your desk' rule, creating a physical environment that promotes creativity, collaboration, and social interaction.",

      "title": "I can describe how stories, narratives, and rituals reinforce corporate culture",
      "code": "6.7",
      "what": "Stories about significant events or founders create 'heroes' for the business. Rituals such as recognition ceremonies, weekly social gatherings, and annual celebrations underscore the importance of social interaction and the celebration of achievement.",
      "why": "Stories and rituals build emotional connection to the business and reinforce shared values over time. They help newcomers understand what the business stands for and what behaviour is celebrated.",
      "example": "Moose Toys holds bi-monthly talks followed by all-team lunches, art exhibition visits, and karaoke nights — rituals that strengthen relationships across departments and reinforce the company's fun, collaborative culture.",
