      "correct": "Investors prefer limited liability structures where their risk is capped at their investment amount",
      "correctExplanation": "Venture capital firms avoid unlimited liability exposure. The partnership would likely need to incorporate to attract this level of investment.",

      "correct": "Without perpetuity, the partnership may dissolve, and finding a suitable replacement partner is complex",
      "correctExplanation": "The retiring partner's departure may dissolve the partnership legally, and the remaining partner must find someone compatible in skills, capital and working style.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The retiring partner can simply sell their share on the stock exchange to anyone", "explanation": "Partnership interests cannot be sold on a stock exchange; transfers require agreement and are much less liquid than shares." },

        { "answer": "Taking on a partner provides additional capital with no loss of control whatsoever", "explanation": "A partner has legal rights to participate in decisions; full control cannot be maintained in a general partnership." },

      "correctExplanation": "Joint and several liability in partnerships means the innocent partner can be held responsible for the full damages caused by the fraudulent partner's actions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The innocent partner is completely protected because they had no knowledge of the fraud", "explanation": "Lack of knowledge does not remove joint liability; innocent partners can still be held responsible for partnership obligations." },
