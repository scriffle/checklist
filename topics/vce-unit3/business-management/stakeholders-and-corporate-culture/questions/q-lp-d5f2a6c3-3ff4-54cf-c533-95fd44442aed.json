      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "They are personally liable for all company debts", "explanation": "Personal liability for all debts describes unlimited liability, which applies to sole traders and general partners, not company shareholders." },
        { "answer": "They cannot sell their shares under any circumstances", "explanation": "Limited liability relates to financial risk, not the ability to sell shares; shareholders can transfer shares according to company rules." },
        { "answer": "They must work for the company as paid employees", "explanation": "Shareholders are owners, not necessarily employees; limited liability concerns financial exposure, not employment obligations." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "To personally guarantee all company debts and loans", "explanation": "Directors manage the company; they do not personally guarantee debts unless they have provided a personal guarantee." },

      "correct": "Directors may be personally liable for debts incurred while trading insolvently",
      "correctExplanation": "While limited liability protects shareholders, directors who knowingly allow insolvent trading breach their legal duties and can be held personally liable for resulting debts.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Directors are completely protected by limited liability in all circumstances", "explanation": "Limited liability protects shareholders; directors can be personally liable when they breach their legal duties, such as insolvent trading." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There is no possible conflict because the founder owns the majority of shares", "explanation": "Majority ownership does not eliminate conflicts; directors must consider all shareholders' interests and the company's welfare." },

      "correct": "Creditors face higher risk because they cannot claim shareholders' personal assets if the company fails",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Perpetuity is irrelevant because all businesses automatically survive for 100 years", "explanation": "Only companies with perpetuity have guaranteed ongoing existence; sole traders and partnerships do not have this feature." },

      "correctExplanation": "Limited liability attracts investment but may encourage excessive risk-taking because shareholders' personal assets are protected, which is why director duties and regulations exist.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Limited liability always leads to responsible management without any regulation needed", "explanation": "Without regulation, limited liability could encourage reckless behaviour because personal consequences are reduced." },

      "correct": "Courts may hold directors or shareholders personally liable despite the company structure",
      "correctExplanation": "In cases of fraud, insolvent trading or misuse of the company structure, courts can look behind the company to hold individuals personally responsible.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Courts automatically dissolve the company and distribute all assets equally to shareholders", "explanation": "Piercing the veil means imposing personal liability, not dissolving the company or distributing assets." },
        { "answer": "Courts remove the company's right to enter contracts but maintain limited liability for all", "explanation": "Piercing the veil specifically removes the protection of limited liability for individuals who abused the structure." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Companies are dominant solely because governments mandate their use for all businesses", "explanation": "Businesses choose to incorporate; the popularity comes from structural advantages, not government mandates." },
