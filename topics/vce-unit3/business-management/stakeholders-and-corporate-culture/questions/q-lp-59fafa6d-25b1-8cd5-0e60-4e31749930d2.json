      "question": "Compare a corporate culture that emphasises kindness with one that emphasises aggressive competition. How might each affect employee wellbeing?",
      "correct": "A kindness-based culture supports wellbeing through positive relationships, while aggressive competition may increase stress and burnout",
      "correctExplanation": "Cultures centred on kindness foster supportive work environments, whereas highly competitive cultures can create pressure that harms employee mental health.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both cultures produce identical outcomes for employee wellbeing", "explanation": "Different cultural values create very different work environments. Kindness and aggression produce contrasting effects on employee wellbeing." },

      "question": "Evaluate why a business might struggle to maintain its corporate culture during a period of rapid growth and hiring.",
      "correct": "New employees may not share the existing values, and informal cultural transmission becomes harder at scale",
      "correctExplanation": "Rapid growth dilutes established culture because new hires bring different values and the informal ways culture is passed on become less effective in larger groups.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Corporate culture automatically strengthens as a business grows in size", "explanation": "Growth often challenges culture because more people means more diverse values and greater difficulty in maintaining shared norms." },

      "correct": "Leaders model expected behaviours and their decisions signal which values are genuinely prioritised",
      "correctExplanation": "Employees look to leaders for cues about what behaviour is truly valued. Leaders who act consistently with stated values reinforce the culture authentically.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Leaders have no influence on corporate culture because it develops entirely on its own", "explanation": "While culture is partly organic, leaders significantly shape it through their actions, decisions, and the behaviours they reward or discourage." },
        { "answer": "Leaders only affect culture when they issue written policy documents", "explanation": "Culture is shaped more by observable leader behaviour than by written documents. Actions speak louder than policies." },

      "correct": "Employees may become cynical and disengaged because they perceive hypocrisy between words and actions",
      "correctExplanation": "A gap between stated values and actual behaviour undermines trust, reduces morale, and signals that the real culture differs from the official one.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There are no consequences because employees do not notice cultural inconsistencies", "explanation": "Employees are highly aware of gaps between stated values and real behaviour. Such inconsistencies erode trust and engagement." },
        { "answer": "The stated values automatically override actual behaviour over time", "explanation": "Actions shape culture more than words. If behaviour contradicts stated values, the actual behaviour defines the real culture." },

      "correctExplanation": "When a business's internal culture aligns with what customers value, it creates authentic interactions and a brand reputation that attracts loyal customers.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "By hiding the corporate culture from customers so competitors cannot copy it", "explanation": "Visible culture strengthens brand identity. Hiding values prevents customers from connecting with the business authentically." },
        { "answer": "By changing the corporate culture every month to follow market trends", "explanation": "Frequent cultural changes appear inauthentic and create internal confusion. Customers value consistency and genuine commitment to values." },
