      "correct": "Audit current practices, retrain staff, redesign reward systems, and ensure leaders visibly model the desired values",
      "correctExplanation": "A multi-faceted approach addressing practices, training, incentives, and leadership behaviour is needed to genuinely shift real culture.",
      "distractors": [

      "question": "Evaluate the Carrington Pty Ltd case: the official culture states 'Happy clients are our first priority' but agents show poor customer service. Who bears the greatest responsibility for this gap?",
      "correct": "Management, because they are responsible for hiring, training, and enforcing the standards they publicly set",
      "correctExplanation": "While agents display the poor behaviour, it is management's role to create systems that reinforce official values through training, incentives, and accountability.",
      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [

      "correct": "Because culture evolves over time and new gaps can emerge as the business grows, changes leadership, or faces new pressures",
      "correctExplanation": "Cultural alignment is not a one-time achievement. Regular audits identify emerging gaps before they become entrenched problems.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because cultural audits are legally required every year by the Australian government", "explanation": "There is no legal requirement for annual cultural audits. Their value lies in proactive management, not compliance." },
        { "answer": "Because once culture is aligned it can never change or drift apart again in future", "explanation": "Culture is dynamic and can shift due to leadership changes, growth, or external pressures, making regular audits necessary." },
        { "answer": "Because cultural audits always confirm that no gap exists in any business", "explanation": "Audits are designed to detect gaps, and they frequently reveal areas where real culture has drifted from official values." }

      "correctExplanation": "Lowering official standards to match dysfunction accepts poor performance as the norm rather than driving improvement.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Yes, because alignment is always positive regardless of the quality of the culture", "explanation": "Alignment with a negative culture is harmful. The goal should be alignment around positive, productive values." },
