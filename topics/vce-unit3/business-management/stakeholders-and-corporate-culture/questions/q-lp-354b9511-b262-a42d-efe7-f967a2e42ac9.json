      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "A legal dispute between a business and a foreign government", "explanation": "While legal disputes can involve stakeholders, a stakeholder conflict specifically refers to disagreements between groups with an interest in the business." },
        { "answer": "A friendly agreement between all stakeholder groups", "explanation": "Conflicts involve disagreements, not agreements. Stakeholder conflicts arise when interests clash rather than align." },
        { "answer": "A marketing strategy used to attract new customers", "explanation": "Stakeholder conflicts are not a strategy. They are tensions that arise from competing interests among groups connected to the business." }

      "question": "Which of the following is the best example of a stakeholder conflict?",
      "correct": "Employees wanting higher wages while shareholders want larger dividends",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "All employees agreeing to a proposed pay increase", "explanation": "If everyone agrees, there is no conflict. Stakeholder conflicts require opposing interests between groups." },

        { "answer": "A supplier delivering materials on time as agreed", "explanation": "Successful delivery fulfils expectations and does not represent a conflict between stakeholder groups." }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Why do stakeholder conflicts arise in businesses?",
      "correct": "Because different groups have different needs and priorities",
      "correctExplanation": "Stakeholder conflicts are a natural result of diverse groups each having their own interests and expectations of the business.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because businesses deliberately create tension among groups", "explanation": "Businesses do not intentionally create conflicts. They arise naturally from differing stakeholder priorities." },
        { "answer": "Because all stakeholder groups always want the same outcome", "explanation": "If all groups wanted the same outcome, there would be no conflict. Conflicts exist because priorities differ." },

      "question": "Assess the effectiveness of Coles' strategy of offering FSC-certified alternatives when removing single-use plastic tableware.",
      "correct": "It was effective because it addressed both environmental concerns and customer needs, reducing the severity of the stakeholder conflict",
      "correctExplanation": "By providing affordable sustainable alternatives, Coles satisfied environmental stakeholders without abandoning customer expectations for convenience and affordability.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It was ineffective because no customers care about affordable alternatives", "explanation": "Customers do value affordable alternatives, and providing them was crucial to maintaining customer satisfaction during the transition." },
        { "answer": "It was ineffective because environmental stakeholders only accept zero-waste solutions", "explanation": "FSC-certified alternatives represent meaningful environmental progress. Most environmental stakeholders recognise incremental improvement as valuable." },
        { "answer": "It was unnecessary because removing the products alone would have satisfied all groups", "explanation": "Without alternatives, customers would have been dissatisfied. The alternatives were essential to balancing the competing interests." }

      "question": "Propose and justify a strategy for a business facing conflict between cost-cutting demands from shareholders and environmental protection expectations from the community.",
      "correct": "Invest in eco-efficiency measures that reduce waste and energy costs, delivering both environmental and financial benefits simultaneously",
      "correctExplanation": "Eco-efficiency strategies create shared value by lowering costs through reduced waste while meeting community environmental expectations.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Publicly commit to environmental goals but privately continue polluting to save costs", "explanation": "Greenwashing is unethical and creates severe reputational risk if exposed, worsening the conflict rather than resolving it." },
        { "answer": "Abandon all environmental efforts and focus exclusively on cost reduction", "explanation": "Ignoring community expectations leads to boycotts, negative publicity, and potential regulatory penalties that increase costs." },
        { "answer": "Ask shareholders to accept zero returns indefinitely to fund environmental programs", "explanation": "Shareholders will withdraw investment if returns are eliminated. A sustainable strategy must deliver value to both groups." }

      "question": "Evaluate the ethical implications of a business choosing to automate production, displacing 200 workers, to remain competitive in a global market.",
      "correct": "The business faces a tension between its obligation to employees and its need for long-term survival, requiring careful management of the transition",
      "correctExplanation": "Automation may be necessary for survival but creates ethical obligations to support displaced workers through retraining, redundancy packages, or transition assistance.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There are no ethical implications because automation is always beneficial for all stakeholders", "explanation": "Displacing 200 workers has significant ethical implications for those employees and their families, even if the business benefits." },
        { "answer": "The business should never automate because employee interests always outweigh competitiveness", "explanation": "Failing to remain competitive could result in business closure, which would harm all stakeholders including employees." },
        { "answer": "Automation only affects shareholders and has no impact on employees or the community", "explanation": "Automation directly displaces workers and can affect the broader community through reduced local employment and spending." }

      "question": "Compare a negotiation approach to a prioritisation approach when resolving a conflict between customers demanding lower prices and suppliers seeking higher payments.",
      "correct": "Negotiation seeks mutual agreement and preserves relationships, while prioritisation risks alienating the deprioritised group",
      "correctExplanation": "Negotiation involves dialogue to find acceptable terms for both parties, whereas prioritising one group may damage the long-term relationship with the other.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Prioritisation is always better because it produces faster decisions than negotiation", "explanation": "Faster decisions may cause greater conflict. Negotiation takes longer but produces more sustainable outcomes." },
        { "answer": "Negotiation is unnecessary because customers and suppliers never have conflicting interests", "explanation": "Customers want lower prices while suppliers want higher payments, creating a clear and common conflict." },

      "correctExplanation": "By addressing conflicts creatively, businesses can discover new products, processes, or approaches that satisfy diverse stakeholder interests and strengthen competitive advantage.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Conflicts are always destructive and can never lead to positive outcomes for any stakeholder", "explanation": "Many business innovations and improvements have emerged from the need to resolve conflicting stakeholder demands." },
        { "answer": "Businesses should welcome conflicts because they distract stakeholders from other issues", "explanation": "The value of conflicts lies in driving constructive change, not in creating distractions." },

      "question": "Evaluate the long-term sustainability of a strategy where a business resolves every stakeholder conflict by increasing prices to fund competing demands.",
      "correct": "This strategy is unsustainable because rising prices will eventually drive away customers, reducing revenue and creating new conflicts",
      "correctExplanation": "Continually raising prices to fund stakeholder demands ignores market competition and customer price sensitivity, ultimately undermining the business.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This strategy is perfectly sustainable because customers will always pay higher prices for any product", "explanation": "Customers have price thresholds and alternatives. Continuous price increases risk losing market share to competitors." },
        { "answer": "This strategy only fails if competitors also raise their prices at the same rate", "explanation": "If competitors maintain lower prices, the business loses customers regardless of what competitors do with their own pricing." },
        { "answer": "Price increases have no impact on customer behaviour or purchasing decisions", "explanation": "Price is a fundamental factor in customer purchasing decisions. Higher prices reduce demand unless offset by increased perceived value." }

      "correctExplanation": "Transparency builds trust across all groups but manifests differently: employees feel valued and included, while community and customer stakeholders see the business as trustworthy.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Transparency only benefits external stakeholders because internal groups already know all decisions", "explanation": "Employees often feel excluded from decision-making. Transparency helps internal stakeholders feel heard and valued." },
        { "answer": "Transparency makes all stakeholder conflicts worse by revealing information that causes panic", "explanation": "While transparency can surface difficult truths, it generally builds trust and reduces suspicion compared to secrecy." },
        { "answer": "Transparency has no effect on stakeholder trust because stakeholders only care about financial outcomes", "explanation": "Stakeholders value being informed and respected. Trust built through transparency can reduce conflict even when financial outcomes are unchanged." }
