      "correct": "Structure is highly influential but works alongside other factors like leadership style, policies, and people to shape culture",

      "correct": "Self-managing teams promote ownership and innovation, while departments provide specialisation and clear accountability",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Self-managing teams and departmental structures create identical workplace cultures in every context", "explanation": "The approaches produce significantly different cultural dynamics around autonomy, collaboration, and accountability." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Mergers have no cultural impact because employees immediately adapt to whatever new structure is implemented", "explanation": "Cultural integration during mergers is one of the most challenging aspects, often taking years to achieve." },
