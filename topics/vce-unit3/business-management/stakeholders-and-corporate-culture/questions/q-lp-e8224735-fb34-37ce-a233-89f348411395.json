      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There is no tension because customers are happy to share unlimited personal data for better service", "explanation": "Many customers are increasingly concerned about data privacy, creating real tension with personalisation expectations." },

      "correct": "By embedding service excellence into the corporate culture so it becomes a genuine part of how employees think and act",
      "correctExplanation": "Culture-driven service excellence is difficult to copy because it requires deep organisational commitment, training, and authentic employee engagement.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "By writing a customer service policy document and filing it in the office without implementing it", "explanation": "A policy document alone does not create competitive advantage. Real implementation through culture and practice is required." },

      "correctExplanation": "Segmenting the product range allows the business to serve both price-sensitive and values-driven customers effectively.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The business should ignore this data because 40% is not a large enough market segment", "explanation": "40% is a substantial segment. Ignoring it means missing significant revenue opportunities and competitive positioning." },
