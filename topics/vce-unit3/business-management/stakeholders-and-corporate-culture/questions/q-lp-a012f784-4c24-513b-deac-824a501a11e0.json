      "question": "A fast fashion retailer launches a clothing recycling program while continuing to produce millions of low-quality garments designed to be discarded quickly. Evaluate the effectiveness of this CSR strategy.",
      "correct": "The recycling program is undermined by the core business model, which encourages excessive consumption and waste",
      "correctExplanation": "A recycling program cannot offset the environmental damage of producing disposable clothing at massive scale. Effective CSR would require addressing the root cause of waste.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The recycling program fully compensates for the environmental impact of fast fashion production", "explanation": "Recycling programs collect only a fraction of garments produced. They cannot offset the total environmental impact of mass fast fashion production." },
        { "answer": "The business model of fast fashion has no connection to environmental sustainability", "explanation": "Fast fashion's reliance on rapid production and disposal is directly linked to environmental harm through waste and resource consumption." },
        { "answer": "All clothing retailers should adopt the same approach without changing their production model", "explanation": "Genuine CSR requires evaluating whether the core business model undermines CSR initiatives, not just adding programs on top." }

      "question": "Compare two businesses: Business A publicly commits to CSR but makes minimal actual changes, while Business B quietly implements significant sustainability improvements without publicising them. Evaluate which approach is more effective from a stakeholder perspective.",
      "correct": "Business B creates greater stakeholder benefit through real impact, but lacks the transparency that stakeholders need to make informed decisions",
      "correctExplanation": "Real impact matters most for stakeholders directly affected, but transparency and communication are also important for building trust and allowing stakeholders to evaluate business practices.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Business A is always more effective because public commitments are all that matter to stakeholders", "explanation": "Public commitments without action constitute greenwashing. Stakeholders ultimately benefit from real changes, not empty promises." },
        { "answer": "Business B's approach is perfect and needs no improvement whatsoever", "explanation": "While real impact is valuable, stakeholders also need transparency to evaluate business practices and make informed decisions." },
        { "answer": "Neither approach has any effect on stakeholders because CSR is irrelevant to business success", "explanation": "CSR significantly affects stakeholder relationships, reputation, and long-term business viability." }

      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Assess the argument that businesses should only pursue CSR strategies that also generate financial returns, rather than those that are purely philanthropic.",
      "correct": "Financially sustainable CSR strategies are more likely to endure long-term, but purely philanthropic actions may be necessary where stakeholder harm is urgent",
      "correctExplanation": "CSR strategies that generate returns are sustainable, but some stakeholder needs require action regardless of financial benefit, creating a tension businesses must manage.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Businesses should never consider financial returns when making CSR decisions", "explanation": "Financial sustainability matters because CSR strategies that drain resources cannot be maintained long-term." },
        { "answer": "All CSR activities automatically generate equal financial returns for the business", "explanation": "CSR activities vary widely in their financial impact. Some generate returns while others represent net costs to the business." },
        { "answer": "Philanthropic CSR activities always produce higher returns than strategic ones", "explanation": "Philanthropic activities often have minimal direct financial returns, which is why strategic CSR is sometimes preferred." }

      "question": "A multinational corporation operates ethically in Australia but sources materials from overseas factories with poor labour conditions. Evaluate how this affects the credibility of the corporation's CSR claims.",
      "correct": "The overseas labour practices fundamentally undermine CSR credibility because responsibility extends across the entire supply chain",
      "correctExplanation": "Genuine CSR requires consistent ethical practices across all operations. Poor conditions anywhere in the supply chain contradict claims of social responsibility.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Overseas operations are entirely separate and have no bearing on Australian CSR claims", "explanation": "Modern stakeholders and consumers expect CSR to extend across global supply chains, not just domestic operations." },
        { "answer": "The corporation is fully meeting its CSR obligations because it only needs to be ethical in Australia", "explanation": "CSR extends to all stakeholders, including overseas workers. Limiting responsibility to one country ignores global supply chain impacts." },
        { "answer": "Poor labour conditions overseas always improve a business's Australian reputation", "explanation": "When revealed, poor overseas labour conditions damage reputation and stakeholder trust, particularly among ethically aware consumers." }

      "correct": "Social media amplifies stakeholder pressure by enabling rapid, widespread scrutiny of business practices that were previously less visible",
      "correctExplanation": "Platforms allow consumers to organise campaigns, share evidence of poor practices, and hold businesses accountable in ways that were not possible before social media.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Social media has had no impact on how businesses approach CSR", "explanation": "Social media has fundamentally changed CSR by increasing transparency, enabling consumer activism, and accelerating reputational consequences." },
        { "answer": "Social media only benefits businesses by allowing them to advertise CSR initiatives without scrutiny", "explanation": "Social media also enables stakeholders to challenge misleading CSR claims and expose greenwashing, creating accountability." },
        { "answer": "Consumer campaigns on social media are always ineffective at changing business behaviour", "explanation": "Numerous examples show that social media campaigns have successfully pressured businesses to adopt CSR changes, including plastic reduction." }

      "correct": "By focusing on local community engagement, ethical sourcing within its supply chain, and reducing waste in its own operations",
      "correctExplanation": "Small businesses can implement effective CSR by concentrating on areas within their control, such as local community involvement, ethical supplier relationships, and waste reduction.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Small businesses cannot implement CSR at all because it requires millions of dollars", "explanation": "CSR does not require large budgets. Small actions like reducing waste, sourcing ethically, and supporting the local community are meaningful CSR." },
        { "answer": "Small businesses should copy every initiative of large corporations regardless of cost", "explanation": "Small businesses should tailor CSR to their scale and resources, focusing on achievable actions with genuine local impact." },
        { "answer": "Small businesses should ignore CSR entirely and focus only on maximising profit", "explanation": "Small businesses benefit from CSR through improved local reputation, customer loyalty, and employee satisfaction." }

      "question": "Justify why evaluating the effects of CSR on stakeholders requires considering both short-term costs and long-term benefits.",
      "correct": "Because CSR often involves immediate costs that are offset by sustained improvements in reputation, loyalty, and stakeholder support over time",
      "correctExplanation": "Short-term financial costs of CSR initiatives are frequently balanced by long-term gains including stronger stakeholder relationships, reduced regulatory risk, and enhanced brand value.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because CSR only ever produces short-term costs with no long-term benefits", "explanation": "Research consistently shows that well-implemented CSR generates long-term benefits including improved reputation and stakeholder loyalty." },
        { "answer": "Because long-term effects of CSR are always negative for the business", "explanation": "Long-term CSR effects are typically positive, including enhanced reputation, customer loyalty, and reduced risk of regulatory action." },
        { "answer": "Because CSR evaluation should ignore all financial considerations entirely", "explanation": "Financial considerations are an important part of CSR evaluation because they affect the sustainability and scope of CSR initiatives." }
