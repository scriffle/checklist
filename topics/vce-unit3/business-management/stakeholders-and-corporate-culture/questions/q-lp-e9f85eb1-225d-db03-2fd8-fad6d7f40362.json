        { "answer": "Because the law requires businesses to formally consult with all macro stakeholders before every decision", "explanation": "There is no such legal requirement. However, ignoring macro stakeholders can lead to reputational harm and community backlash." },
        { "answer": "Because macro stakeholders are the only group that matters for long-term profitability", "explanation": "All stakeholder groups matter. Macro stakeholders are important but not the only ones affecting long-term viability." },
        { "answer": "Because businesses have complete control over macro environment stakeholders", "explanation": "Businesses have limited or no control over macro stakeholders, which is precisely why their interests must be carefully considered." }

      "question": "Compare how a sole trader and a large public listed company might differ in their approach to stakeholder management.",
      "correct": "A sole trader has fewer stakeholder relationships to manage, while a public company faces complex demands from shareholders, regulators, and the wider community",
      "correctExplanation": "Public companies have more diverse and numerous stakeholders, including institutional shareholders, regulators, and large customer bases, requiring more formal stakeholder management.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Sole traders have more stakeholders than public companies because they are closer to their community", "explanation": "While sole traders may have close community ties, public companies have far more stakeholder groups including shareholders, regulators, and larger workforces." },
        { "answer": "Public companies have no stakeholders because they are too large for individuals to affect", "explanation": "Large companies have extensive stakeholder networks. Size increases, rather than eliminates, stakeholder relationships." },
        { "answer": "Both business types manage stakeholders in exactly the same way regardless of size", "explanation": "The scale and complexity of stakeholder management differs significantly based on business size and structure." }

      "question": "Evaluate the effectiveness of classifying stakeholders into three environment levels for a business facing a public relations crisis.",
      "correct": "The classification helps the business prioritise responses — addressing internal concerns first, then key operating partners, then broader community perception",
      "correctExplanation": "The three-level framework provides a structured approach to crisis response by identifying which groups need immediate attention and which require longer-term communication strategies.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The classification is useless in a crisis because all stakeholders react in the same way", "explanation": "Different stakeholder groups have different concerns during a crisis. Internal employees worry about job security while the community worries about safety." },
        { "answer": "The classification means the business should only communicate with internal stakeholders during a crisis", "explanation": "Effective crisis management requires communication with all stakeholder levels, not just internal ones." },
        { "answer": "The classification only applies to businesses in the manufacturing sector", "explanation": "The three-level classification applies to all businesses regardless of industry." }

      "question": "A tech company decides to automate its customer service, replacing 50 call centre workers with AI chatbots. Analyse the stakeholder implications.",
      "correct": "Employees face job losses, customers may receive faster but less personalised service, and shareholders benefit from reduced labour costs",
      "correctExplanation": "Automation creates a complex stakeholder trade-off: cost savings benefit shareholders, but employees lose jobs and customer experience changes.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "All stakeholders benefit equally from the increased efficiency of AI chatbots", "explanation": "Employees who lose their jobs clearly do not benefit. Customers may also be disadvantaged by less personalised service." },
        { "answer": "Only the technology supplier benefits from this decision", "explanation": "While the tech supplier benefits, the decision has wide-ranging impacts on employees, customers, shareholders, and the community." },
        { "answer": "The decision has no stakeholder implications because it is purely a technology change", "explanation": "Technology changes that affect employment, customer service, and costs have significant implications for multiple stakeholder groups." }

      "correct": "Growing community expectations, social media transparency, and increased regulation mean businesses face greater scrutiny from a wider range of groups",
      "correctExplanation": "Modern communication technology and societal expectations mean stakeholder concerns are more visible and impactful than ever before.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because stakeholders did not exist before the year 2000", "explanation": "Stakeholders have always existed. What has changed is the level of awareness, transparency, and expectation placed on businesses." },
        { "answer": "Because the government recently invented the concept of stakeholders for regulatory purposes", "explanation": "The stakeholder concept has been used in business theory for decades. Increased importance reflects changing societal expectations, not a new invention." },
        { "answer": "Because modern businesses have fewer stakeholders than businesses in previous decades", "explanation": "Modern businesses typically have more stakeholders and face greater scrutiny from them due to globalisation and social media." }

      "question": "A business donates profits to a local charity while simultaneously laying off workers to cut costs. Evaluate this from a stakeholder perspective.",
      "correct": "The business is prioritising its relationship with the community over its obligations to employees, creating a stakeholder inconsistency",
      "correctExplanation": "Donating to charity while laying off workers suggests misaligned priorities — internal stakeholders (employees) are being harmed while the business seeks positive community perception.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The business is acting in the best interests of all stakeholders simultaneously", "explanation": "Laying off workers directly harms employee stakeholders, which contradicts the claim of acting in everyone's best interest." },
        { "answer": "The charity donation eliminates any negative effects of the layoffs", "explanation": "Charity donations do not compensate employees for lost jobs. These are separate stakeholder impacts that must each be managed." },
        { "answer": "This scenario has no stakeholder implications because charity is always positive", "explanation": "While charity is positive for the community, the simultaneous layoffs create a significant negative impact on employee stakeholders." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Ignore employee wage demands entirely and pay all profits as dividends", "explanation": "Ignoring employee interests leads to dissatisfaction, high turnover, and ultimately lower productivity and profits." },
        { "answer": "Pay all profits as wages and eliminate dividends completely", "explanation": "Eliminating dividends would discourage investment and could threaten the business's ability to raise capital." },
