    { "type": "mc", "question": "What is a policy in a business context?", "correct": "A written statement detailing processes, procedures, rules, and regulations", "correctExplanation": "Policies are formal documents that set out how specific situations should be handled within the business.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "A verbal agreement between two employees about lunch breaks", "explanation": "Verbal agreements are informal. Policies are formal written documents that apply consistently." }, { "answer": "A customer complaint form submitted to the manager", "explanation": "Complaint forms are feedback tools. Policies are formal rules governing business processes." }, { "answer": "A monthly sales report presented to the board of directors", "explanation": "Sales reports are performance documents. Policies set out rules and procedures for the workplace." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "How do policies help reinforce corporate culture?", "correct": "By translating cultural values into consistent, enforceable standards", "correctExplanation": "Policies turn abstract values into concrete rules that guide daily behaviour and ensure consistency.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "By allowing each employee to create their own individual rules", "explanation": "Individual rules would create inconsistency. Policies ensure uniform standards across the organisation." }, { "answer": "By eliminating the need for managers to communicate with employees", "explanation": "Policies supplement communication, not replace it. Managers must still explain and model expected behaviour." }, { "answer": "By setting product prices for the business's goods and services", "explanation": "Pricing is a commercial decision. Policies address workplace behaviour and procedures." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "A business has a social media policy prohibiting Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok during work hours. What does this establish?", "correct": "A consistent standard of professionalism for all employees", "correctExplanation": "The policy ensures every employee follows the same rule, reinforcing a culture of professionalism and focus.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "A suggestion that employees might consider reducing social media use", "explanation": "Policies are mandatory standards, not optional suggestions. This rule applies to all employees equally." }, { "answer": "A requirement that only senior managers can use social media at work", "explanation": "The described policy applies to all employees equally, not just specific levels of management." }, { "answer": "A plan to block all internet access throughout the entire building", "explanation": "The policy targets specific social media platforms, not all internet use." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "What is one key benefit of having clear workplace policies?", "correct": "They ensure all employees face the same consequences for the same behaviour", "correctExplanation": "Clear policies create fairness by applying rules consistently to everyone, regardless of position or personal relationships.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "They guarantee that no employee will ever break any workplace rule", "explanation": "Policies set standards but cannot guarantee compliance. They provide a framework for addressing breaches." }, { "answer": "They eliminate the need for any form of management supervision", "explanation": "Policies support management, not replace it. Managers must still monitor compliance and address issues." }, { "answer": "They allow senior managers to be exempt from all workplace rules", "explanation": "Effective policies apply to everyone. Exemptions for senior staff undermine fairness and cultural consistency." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "How do policies help resolve workplace conflicts?", "correct": "By providing established procedures for addressing disagreements fairly", "correctExplanation": "Policies outline processes for conflict resolution, ensuring disputes are handled consistently and transparently.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "By preventing all conflicts from ever occurring in the workplace", "explanation": "Policies cannot prevent all conflicts, but they provide fair processes for resolving them when they arise." }, { "answer": "By allowing the most senior person to always win any dispute", "explanation": "Fair policies resolve conflicts based on process and merit, not seniority alone." }, { "answer": "By ignoring conflicts until they resolve themselves naturally over time", "explanation": "Ignoring conflicts typically makes them worse. Policies provide proactive resolution mechanisms." }] },

    { "type": "mc", "question": "How do policies establish consistency in a business with multiple locations?", "correct": "They ensure the same rules and expectations apply regardless of which location an employee works at", "correctExplanation": "Standardised policies create a unified culture across all sites, preventing inconsistencies between locations.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Policies cannot operate across multiple locations and only work in single-site businesses", "explanation": "Policies are designed to scale. They are particularly valuable for maintaining consistency across locations." }, { "answer": "Each location should create entirely different policies based on local manager preferences", "explanation": "While some adaptation may be needed, core policies should be consistent to maintain unified culture." }, { "answer": "Multiple locations do not need policies because each site develops its own natural culture", "explanation": "Without common policies, locations may develop inconsistent cultures that undermine the business's identity." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "Why must policies be regularly reviewed and updated to remain effective?", "correct": "Because workplace expectations, laws, and cultural priorities evolve over time", "correctExplanation": "Outdated policies fail to address current issues and can create gaps between stated rules and actual practice.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Policies never need updating because workplace rules remain constant forever", "explanation": "Workplaces change constantly. Policies must be updated to remain relevant and effective." }, { "answer": "Reviews are only necessary when the government forces the business to change its rules", "explanation": "While legal changes trigger updates, businesses should also review policies to maintain cultural relevance." }, { "answer": "Updating policies always weakens corporate culture by creating confusion about which rules apply", "explanation": "Well-communicated updates strengthen culture by ensuring policies remain relevant and meaningful." }] },

    { "type": "mc", "question": "What is the relationship between policies and employee rights?", "correct": "Policies recognise rights and obligations, ensuring employees understand both what they can expect and what is expected of them", "correctExplanation": "Well-crafted policies balance employee rights with responsibilities, creating a fair and transparent framework.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Policies only impose obligations on employees and never recognise any employee rights", "explanation": "Good policies address both rights and responsibilities, creating a balanced and fair workplace." }, { "answer": "Employee rights are not relevant to workplace policies because they are purely legal matters", "explanation": "Policies incorporate legal rights but also establish additional workplace rights that shape culture." }, { "answer": "Policies give managers unlimited rights while removing all rights from other employees", "explanation": "Effective policies apply fairly to all levels and balance rights with responsibilities for everyone." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "How does a dress code or uniform policy reflect corporate culture?", "correct": "It communicates values about professionalism, team identity, or brand image to both employees and customers", "correctExplanation": "Dress policies signal what the business values — whether it is formality, creativity, uniformity, or individual expression.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Dress codes have no cultural significance and are purely practical decisions about clothing", "explanation": "What people wear communicates cultural messages about formality, identity, and values." }, { "answer": "Only retail businesses can have dress code policies; office businesses cannot", "explanation": "Dress policies exist across all types of businesses and contribute to culture in each context." }, { "answer": "Employees always ignore dress code policies, making them completely ineffective", "explanation": "While compliance varies, dress codes shape visual culture and communicate expectations to employees and visitors." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "What happens when policies exist on paper but are not consistently enforced?", "correct": "Employees lose trust in the fairness of rules, and the real culture diverges from the official culture", "correctExplanation": "Inconsistent enforcement creates a gap between what the business says it values and what actually happens.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Inconsistent enforcement has no effect because employees understand policies are only guidelines", "explanation": "Inconsistency undermines trust and signals that stated values are not genuinely held." }, { "answer": "Employees prefer inconsistent enforcement because it gives them more personal freedom", "explanation": "While some may exploit inconsistency, most employees value fairness and predictable standards." }, { "answer": "Inconsistent enforcement only affects the specific employees involved and no one else", "explanation": "All employees observe how policies are enforced. Inconsistency affects the entire organisation's trust in fairness." }] },

The cultural benefit comes from demonstrating trust, not from the location itself." }, { "answer": "Rigid attendance policies always produce better cultures because structure is more important than flexibility", "explanation": "Rigid policies can signal distrust. The best approach depends on the business context and workforce needs." }, { "answer": "Work-from-home policies have no cultural impact because culture only exists within the physical office", "explanation": "Culture extends beyond physical location. Policies about flexibility communicate values about trust and wellbeing." }] },

    { "type": "mc", "question": "Evaluate the cultural impact of a policy that encourages employees to report unethical behaviour without fear of retaliation.", "correct": "It creates a culture of integrity and psychological safety where ethical standards are actively protected", "correctExplanation": "Whistleblower protections demonstrate that the business genuinely values ethics, encouraging open communication.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Such policies create a culture of distrust where employees constantly monitor and report each other", "explanation": "Well-designed reporting policies protect ethics without creating surveillance cultures. The focus is on serious misconduct." }, { "answer": "Ethical reporting policies have no cultural impact because no one ever reports anything", "explanation": "The existence of safe reporting mechanisms itself sends a cultural message about the business's commitment to ethics." }, { "answer": "Only government organisations need ethical reporting policies; private businesses do not", "explanation": "All organisations benefit from ethical reporting mechanisms, regardless of ownership structure." }] },

Safety needs clear rules; customer service benefits from guiding principles.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "All policies should be prescriptive because employees cannot be trusted to make their own decisions", "explanation": "Over-prescription stifles initiative. Many situations benefit from employee judgment guided by principles." }, { "answer": "All policies should be principles-based because detailed rules are never necessary in any context", "explanation": "Some areas like safety and compliance require specific, detailed rules that cannot be left to interpretation." }, { "answer": "The prescriptive versus principles debate is irrelevant because policies have no effect on behaviour", "explanation": "Policy design significantly affects how employees interpret and apply rules in their daily work." }] },

They work best when aligned with and supported by other cultural strategies.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Policies are the only cultural tool a business needs; other strategies are redundant", "explanation": "Policies alone cannot create culture.
