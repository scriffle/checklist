      "question": "A successful social enterprise generating $2 million annually faces pressure to convert to a traditional for-profit model, which investors estimate would triple its revenue. The founder refuses. Evaluate the founder's decision.",
      "correct": "The founder prioritises the social mission that defines the enterprise's identity and purpose",
      "correctExplanation": "Converting would undermine the organisation's fundamental purpose. The founder recognises that the social mission is the enterprise's reason for existence, not just a feature.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The founder is making an irrational decision that will inevitably destroy the business", "explanation": "Many social enterprises thrive long-term by maintaining their mission, which attracts loyal customers and dedicated staff." },
        { "answer": "The conversion would have no effect on the enterprise's social impact whatsoever", "explanation": "Converting to for-profit would likely redirect profits away from social outcomes, fundamentally changing the impact." },
        { "answer": "Revenue size is the only valid measure of a business's success or value", "explanation": "Social enterprises measure success through social impact alongside financial performance, not revenue alone." }

      "question": "Critics argue that social enterprises are less efficient than traditional businesses because they pursue two goals instead of one. Evaluate this criticism.",
      "correct": "Dual goals can create complexity but also motivate staff and attract purpose-driven customers",
      "correctExplanation": "While managing two objectives adds complexity, the social purpose often inspires greater employee engagement and customer loyalty, potentially improving overall performance.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The criticism is entirely valid because businesses can only pursue one goal effectively", "explanation": "Many successful organisations manage multiple objectives simultaneously; dual goals can be complementary." },
        { "answer": "Social enterprises are always more efficient than every traditional business overall", "explanation": "Efficiency varies between individual businesses; neither model is universally more efficient." },
        { "answer": "Efficiency is completely irrelevant to any type of business in modern economies", "explanation": "Efficiency matters for all businesses including social enterprises, which must use resources wisely to sustain their mission." }

      "correct": "Tax incentives may encourage social enterprise growth but could create unfair advantages over traditional businesses",
      "correctExplanation": "Incentives would support the social enterprise sector but might distort competition if traditional businesses with similar products do not receive equivalent benefits.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Tax incentives would have no impact on social enterprise growth or behaviour", "explanation": "Tax benefits reduce costs and can significantly encourage the establishment and growth of social enterprises." },
        { "answer": "All businesses should receive identical tax treatment regardless of their social impact", "explanation": "Tax policy often differentiates between activities; the question is whether social impact justifies differential treatment." },

        { "answer": "Social enterprises will replace all traditional businesses within the next decade", "explanation": "Social enterprises are growing but are unlikely to replace all traditional businesses; both models will coexist." },

      "correct": "Use profits from the commercial product to cross-subsidise the social programs",
      "correctExplanation": "Cross-subsidisation allows the enterprise to maintain both its commercial viability and its social mission by using profitable activities to fund impactful ones.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Immediately discontinue the profitable product line to focus only on social impact", "explanation": "Abandoning the profitable line would remove the funding source needed to sustain the social programs." },

      "question": "A social enterprise measures its success using both financial metrics and social impact indicators. Why is this dual measurement approach important?",
      "correct": "It ensures both goals are tracked and neither is neglected over time",
      "correctExplanation": "Measuring both dimensions ensures the enterprise remains accountable to its dual purpose and can identify when one goal is being sacrificed for the other.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Social impact cannot be measured so only financial metrics matter for assessment", "explanation": "Social impact can be measured through various indicators; dual measurement is both possible and valuable." },
        { "answer": "Financial metrics are irrelevant to social enterprises and should be completely ignored", "explanation": "Financial sustainability is essential for social enterprises to continue operating and funding their social mission." },
        { "answer": "Dual measurement is unnecessary because social and financial goals always align perfectly", "explanation": "These goals can conflict, making separate measurement essential for balanced decision-making." }

      "correct": "No, HoMie's core purpose is social impact while the retailer's primary purpose remains profit",
      "correctExplanation": "A social enterprise is defined by having social outcomes as a primary goal, not just making charitable donations from a profit-maximising business.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Yes, any business that makes any charitable donation qualifies as a social enterprise", "explanation": "Charitable donations alone do not make a business a social enterprise; the social purpose must be central to its mission." },
        { "answer": "Neither business is a social enterprise because both sell commercial products", "explanation": "Selling products commercially is a feature of social enterprises; HoMie qualifies because its primary purpose is social impact." },
        { "answer": "The traditional retailer is more of a social enterprise because it donates voluntarily", "explanation": "The voluntariness of donations does not determine social enterprise status; it is the centrality of social purpose that matters." }

      "correct": "Rapid growth may dilute the social mission as commercial pressures intensify",
      "correctExplanation": "As social enterprises scale, maintaining the authenticity of their social purpose becomes harder when commercial demands increase and new stakeholders enter.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Social enterprises face no unique risks when scaling their business operations", "explanation": "The dual-goal model creates specific risks around mission drift that traditional businesses do not face." },
