      "correct": "Stakeholders may view the business as dishonest, leading to reputational damage and loss of customer loyalty",
      "correctExplanation": "When official culture overpromises and underdelivers, stakeholders lose trust, which can harm the business's reputation and customer retention.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There are no risks because stakeholders do not pay attention to official corporate culture", "explanation": "Stakeholders including customers, employees, and investors actively evaluate whether a business lives up to its stated values." },
        { "answer": "The business will automatically improve its operations to match its official culture", "explanation": "Operations do not automatically align with official values. Deliberate action is needed to close the gap." },
        { "answer": "Only competitors are affected when official culture does not match reality", "explanation": "The primary risk falls on the business itself through damaged reputation, lost trust, and reduced stakeholder loyalty." }

      "question": "A business uses its official corporate culture to attract talented employees. Evaluate the long-term consequences if the real culture does not match what was promoted during recruitment.",
      "correct": "New employees may become disillusioned and leave, increasing turnover costs and damaging the employer brand",
      "correctExplanation": "When recruits discover that the workplace does not reflect the promoted values, dissatisfaction and high turnover follow, which is costly and harms reputation.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "New employees will always adapt to the real culture and forget the official promises", "explanation": "Employees who feel misled often disengage or leave rather than simply adapting to a culture that differs from expectations." },
        { "answer": "The mismatch has no impact because employees do not care about corporate culture", "explanation": "Research consistently shows that culture significantly affects employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention." },
        { "answer": "High turnover from culture mismatch benefits the business by constantly bringing in fresh perspectives", "explanation": "High turnover is costly and disruptive. While fresh perspectives are valuable, involuntary turnover from culture mismatch is harmful." }

      "question": "Justify why a business should invest time and resources into developing a strong official corporate culture, even though it does not directly generate revenue.",
      "correct": "A strong official culture guides decision-making, attracts stakeholders, and creates a foundation for long-term competitive advantage",
      "correctExplanation": "While not directly generating revenue, official culture shapes strategic direction, attracts talent and customers, and differentiates the business from competitors.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There is no justification because official corporate culture is a waste of resources", "explanation": "Official culture provides strategic direction and stakeholder alignment, making it a valuable investment despite not directly generating revenue." },

      "correct": "By updating formal communications to reflect new values, the business can signal its direction and build stakeholder confidence in the change process",
      "correctExplanation": "Official culture serves as a communication tool that reassures stakeholders and provides clarity about the business's evolving identity and priorities.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Official culture should be completely abandoned during organisational change to avoid confusion", "explanation": "Abandoning official culture during change creates uncertainty. Updating it provides guidance and reassurance to stakeholders." },

      "question": "Evaluate the claim that official corporate culture is nothing more than a marketing exercise with no real impact on business operations.",
      "correct": "While it can be superficial if not implemented, a well-embedded official culture genuinely shapes operations, decision-making, and stakeholder relationships",
      "correctExplanation": "Official culture has real operational impact when it is actively reinforced through training, policies, and leadership behaviour rather than existing only on paper.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is entirely correct — official culture is purely decorative and has no operational impact", "explanation": "When properly implemented, official culture directly influences how employees make decisions and interact with stakeholders." },
        { "answer": "Official corporate culture always has a real impact regardless of how it is implemented", "explanation": "Official culture only has impact when it is actively reinforced. Without implementation, it remains aspirational rather than operational." },
        { "answer": "The claim is irrelevant because no business has ever used official corporate culture strategically", "explanation": "Many businesses successfully use official culture as a strategic tool to guide behaviour and differentiate their brand." }

      "correct": "By comparing stated values against employee surveys, customer feedback, and observable workplace behaviours",
      "correctExplanation": "Measuring culture adoption requires gathering evidence from multiple sources to assess whether official values are reflected in actual practice.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "By counting how many posters displaying the mission statement are hung in the office", "explanation": "The number of posters measures visibility, not adoption. True adoption is measured through behaviour and feedback." },
        { "answer": "By asking the CEO whether they believe the culture has been adopted", "explanation": "A single perspective from the top does not accurately measure culture adoption across the whole organisation." },
        { "answer": "By checking whether the official culture documents have been printed in colour rather than black and white", "explanation": "Print quality has no relationship to culture adoption. Adoption is measured through behaviour and stakeholder feedback." }

      "correct": "Stakeholders may become confused and cynical, viewing each new set of values as empty rhetoric rather than genuine commitment",
      "correctExplanation": "Frequent changes without implementation signal a lack of genuine commitment, eroding stakeholder trust and making future culture initiatives less credible.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Frequent changes keep the business innovative and ensure stakeholders remain engaged", "explanation": "Constant change without follow-through creates confusion, not innovation. Stakeholders value consistency and genuine commitment." },
        { "answer": "There are no consequences because stakeholders do not notice changes to official culture", "explanation": "Stakeholders such as employees and customers do notice and react when a business repeatedly changes its stated values without follow-through." },
        { "answer": "Frequent changes automatically improve the real corporate culture each time", "explanation": "Changing official statements does not automatically change real behaviour. Without implementation, no cultural improvement occurs." }
