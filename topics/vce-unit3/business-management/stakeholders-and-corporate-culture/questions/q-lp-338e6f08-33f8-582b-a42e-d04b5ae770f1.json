      "question": "A major supermarket chain faces simultaneous demands: shareholders want higher dividends, employees want wage increases, and the community wants affordable food prices. Evaluate the directors' position.",
      "correct": "Directors must prioritise and negotiate competing stakeholder interests strategically",
      "correctExplanation": "With limited resources, satisfying all groups fully is impossible; directors must balance competing demands while maintaining the company's long-term viability.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Directors should only satisfy shareholders since they are the legal owners of the company", "explanation": "While shareholders are owners, directors must consider all stakeholders for long-term business sustainability." },
        { "answer": "All three demands can be met simultaneously without any trade-offs required", "explanation": "Higher wages and lower prices reduce profits, making higher dividends mathematically impossible without other changes." },

      "question": "An activist shareholder group acquires 20% of a fossil fuel company's shares and demands a transition to renewable energy. The transition would cost billions and reduce dividends for a decade. Analyse the implications.",
      "correct": "The activists can influence strategy but must convince other shareholders of long-term value",
      "correctExplanation": "A 20% stake gives significant influence but not majority control; the activists must persuade enough other shareholders that the long-term benefits outweigh short-term costs.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "A 20% stake gives complete control to immediately implement any strategy change", "explanation": "20% is influential but does not constitute majority control; other shareholders must also support the change." },
        { "answer": "The company has no obligation to listen to any shareholder regardless of stake size", "explanation": "Companies must allow shareholders to exercise voting rights, and a 20% stake carries substantial influence." },

      "question": "A pharmaceutical company could either invest in developing affordable medicines for developing countries or use the funds to pay a special dividend. The board chooses the dividend. Evaluate this decision from a shareholder expectations perspective.",
      "correct": "The decision satisfies immediate financial expectations but may expose the company to reputational risk",
      "correctExplanation": "While the dividend pleases income-seeking shareholders, the missed opportunity for social impact could damage the company's reputation and long-term brand value.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The decision is unquestionably correct because shareholders always come first in all scenarios", "explanation": "Modern corporate governance recognises that shareholder value is best served when broader stakeholder interests are also considered." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Maintaining dividends during a downturn has no financial consequences at all", "explanation": "Paying dividends from declining profits depletes cash reserves that may be needed for operational survival." },
        { "answer": "Companies are legally required to maintain dividends regardless of profit levels", "explanation": "Companies can reduce or suspend dividends; the decision to maintain them is strategic, not legally required." },

      "correctExplanation": "Effective governance involves weighing diverse shareholder views and making decisions that balance growth opportunities with financial stability for all shareholders.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The board should simply follow the larger shareholder's preference without question", "explanation": "Good governance considers all significant stakeholder perspectives, not just the single largest shareholder's wishes." },
