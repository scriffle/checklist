      "question": "Assess the risk that a business could use CSR as a substitute for genuine improvements to employee working conditions.",
      "correct": "CSR used to mask poor conditions creates cynicism and ultimately undermines satisfaction more than having no CSR at all",
      "correctExplanation": "When employees perceive CSR as a cover for poor working conditions, the resulting cynicism can damage morale more severely than simply not having CSR programs.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There is no risk because employees always appreciate CSR regardless of their working conditions", "explanation": "Employees can see through insincere CSR. If basic working conditions are poor, CSR programs feel hollow and breed cynicism." },
        { "answer": "CSR should always replace direct improvements to wages and working conditions", "explanation": "CSR should complement, not replace, fair wages and working conditions. Using it as a substitute creates employee resentment." },
        { "answer": "Employees never notice whether their working conditions are good or bad if CSR programs exist", "explanation": "Employees are acutely aware of their working conditions. CSR cannot mask genuine workplace problems." }

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Propose how a business could measure whether its CSR activities are genuinely benefiting internal stakeholders.",
      "correct": "By tracking employee satisfaction surveys, turnover rates, and engagement scores over time",
      "correctExplanation": "Measuring employee satisfaction, retention, and engagement before and after CSR initiatives provides evidence of whether CSR is delivering real internal benefits.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "By counting the number of CSR programs the business has launched", "explanation": "The number of programs does not indicate whether employees are actually benefiting. Outcomes like satisfaction and retention are better measures." },
        { "answer": "By measuring only the external media coverage of CSR activities", "explanation": "Media coverage measures external perception, not internal employee benefit. Employee surveys and turnover rates are more relevant." },
        { "answer": "By asking shareholders whether they believe employees are satisfied", "explanation": "Shareholders are not the best source for employee satisfaction data. Direct employee feedback and retention metrics are more reliable." }

      "question": "Evaluate how the concept of CSR benefits for employees connects to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.",
      "correct": "CSR addresses higher-order needs like belonging and self-esteem by giving employees purpose and pride in their work",
      "correctExplanation": "CSR helps fulfil employees' needs for belonging (community engagement) and esteem (pride in ethical employer), which are higher-order motivators in Maslow's framework.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "CSR only addresses physiological needs by providing food and shelter to employees", "explanation": "CSR primarily addresses higher-order needs like belonging and esteem, not basic physiological needs like food and shelter." },
        { "answer": "CSR has no connection to any motivation theory because it is purely a marketing strategy", "explanation": "CSR directly connects to motivation theories. It fulfils higher-order needs for purpose and pride, which drive intrinsic motivation." },
        { "answer": "CSR satisfies all five levels of Maslow's hierarchy simultaneously for every employee", "explanation": "CSR primarily addresses higher-order needs. It does not automatically fulfil all levels, especially basic physiological and safety needs." }

      "question": "A business implements CSR policies on sustainability and diversity. Some employees strongly support these values while others are indifferent. Evaluate the overall impact on the workforce.",
      "correct": "The net effect is positive because supportive employees become more engaged, while indifferent employees are unlikely to be harmed",
      "correctExplanation": "CSR creates additional engagement for values-aligned employees without typically reducing satisfaction for those who are indifferent, resulting in a net positive effect.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "CSR should be abandoned because not every employee values it equally", "explanation": "Abandoning CSR because some are indifferent ignores the significant positive impact on engaged employees and the overall workplace culture." },
        { "answer": "Indifferent employees will always undermine CSR efforts completely", "explanation": "Indifferent employees do not typically oppose CSR actively. The positive engagement from supportive employees generally outweighs indifference." },
        { "answer": "All employees will respond identically to CSR regardless of personal values", "explanation": "Employees have different values and will respond differently to CSR. The key is that the overall effect tends to be positive." }

      "question": "Justify why a business experiencing financial difficulty should still maintain its CSR commitments to benefit employees.",
      "correct": "Withdrawing CSR during hardship can damage employee trust and loyalty precisely when the business most needs workforce commitment",
      "correctExplanation": "During financial difficulty, employee commitment is critical. Cutting CSR signals that the business only valued responsibility when it was easy, potentially destroying the loyalty built over time.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "CSR should always be the first expense cut during financial difficulty", "explanation": "Cutting CSR first can undermine the employee loyalty and engagement needed to navigate financial challenges successfully." },
        { "answer": "Employees never notice when CSR programs are reduced or eliminated", "explanation": "Employees are often acutely aware of changes to CSR programs, and reductions can signal shifting priorities that damage trust." },
        { "answer": "Financial difficulty makes CSR irrelevant because employees only care about their salary", "explanation": "While salary matters, employees also value working for a responsible employer. Cutting CSR can reduce the sense of purpose that sustains motivation during difficult times." }

      "question": "Evaluate the potential long-term impact on a business if its CSR efforts consistently improve employee satisfaction over several years.",
      "correct": "The business builds a strong employer brand, lower turnover costs, and a culture of high engagement that compounds over time",
      "correctExplanation": "Sustained CSR creates compounding benefits: a growing reputation attracts better talent, low turnover reduces costs, and engaged employees drive continuous improvement.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Long-term CSR has diminishing returns because employees become used to it and stop caring", "explanation": "While initial novelty may fade, embedded CSR becomes part of the organisational culture that continuously reinforces pride and loyalty." },
        { "answer": "Long-term CSR investment always leads to bankruptcy because it diverts resources from profit", "explanation": "Evidence suggests long-term CSR often improves financial performance through lower turnover, higher productivity, and stronger brand reputation." },
        { "answer": "Long-term CSR only benefits retirees and has no impact on current employees", "explanation": "Current employees are the primary beneficiaries of CSR through ongoing pride, satisfaction, and loyalty." }

      "correct": "By communicating the company's CSR values during induction so new employees feel aligned with the business's purpose from day one",
      "correctExplanation": "Introducing CSR commitments during onboarding helps new employees immediately connect with the business's values, establishing pride and engagement from the beginning of their employment.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "By requiring new employees to donate a portion of their first pay to charity", "explanation": "Mandatory donations during onboarding would harm employee satisfaction, not enhance it. CSR integration should inspire, not compel." },
        { "answer": "By hiding CSR activities from new employees until they have worked for at least one year", "explanation": "Delaying CSR communication misses the opportunity to build pride and alignment from the start of employment." },
        { "answer": "By replacing all onboarding training with CSR workshops and nothing else", "explanation": "Effective onboarding requires role-specific training alongside CSR communication, not CSR workshops to the exclusion of everything else." }
