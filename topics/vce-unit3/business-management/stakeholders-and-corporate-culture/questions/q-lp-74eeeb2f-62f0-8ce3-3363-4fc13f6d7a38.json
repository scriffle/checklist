      "correct": "Full privatisation may improve efficiency but could reduce access to essential services in unprofitable areas",
      "correctExplanation": "While private management can drive efficiency, some services require government provision to ensure universal access, particularly in remote and disadvantaged areas.",
      "distractors": [

      "correct": "The government could quickly adjust the balance between public and private sector activity based on crisis needs",
      "correctExplanation": "A mixed economy allows government to expand its role during crises through regulation, subsidies and direct intervention, then contract when conditions improve.",

      "correctExplanation": "The choice involves trade-offs between universal free access funded by taxpayers and user-pays models that may deter low-income users.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There are no trade-offs because both approaches produce identical outcomes for the community", "explanation": "Funding model, access and pricing differ significantly between public and private road provision." },
        { "answer": "Private toll roads always provide superior service to government-built highways in all respects", "explanation": "Service quality varies; the trade-off involves access, pricing and funding sources, not just service quality." },

      "distractors": [
