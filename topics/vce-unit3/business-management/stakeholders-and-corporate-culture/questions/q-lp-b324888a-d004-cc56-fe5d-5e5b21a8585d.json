        { "answer": "Managing the internal employees of the business they supply", "explanation": "Suppliers have no role in managing another business's employees. Their interests relate to their own commercial relationship." }

      "correct": "Digital platforms have intensified competition by enabling new entrants, increasing price transparency, and expanding consumer choice",
      "correctExplanation": "E-commerce removes geographical barriers, allows direct comparisons, and enables smaller businesses to compete with larger retailers.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Digital platforms have eliminated all competition because one company now controls all online retail", "explanation": "Multiple platforms compete for customers online, and digital tools have actually increased the number of competitors." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Monopoly and competitive suppliers have identical interests and behave in exactly the same way", "explanation": "Market structure profoundly affects supplier behaviour, pricing power, and incentives to improve." },
        { "answer": "Monopoly suppliers always provide better quality because they have more resources available", "explanation": "Without competitive pressure, monopoly suppliers may actually provide lower quality than competitive suppliers." },
        { "answer": "Competitive supply markets do not exist in Australia because all suppliers are monopolies", "explanation": "Most supply markets in Australia are competitive, with multiple suppliers offering similar products." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The acquisition would have no effect because the supplier would continue to serve all customers equally", "explanation": "A competitor-owned supplier may prioritise their parent company, restrict access, or increase prices to rivals." },
