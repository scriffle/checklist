        { "answer": "The only stakeholder affected is the retailer's accounting department", "explanation": "Extended payment terms affect the supplier's entire business, including their employees, their own suppliers, and ultimately the retailer's supply reliability." }

      "question": "Propose a strategy that could reduce conflict between management and suppliers while maintaining profitability for both parties.",
      "correct": "Establish collaborative partnerships with transparent cost-sharing, joint planning, and mutually agreed quality benchmarks",
      "correctExplanation": "Collaborative partnerships align both parties' interests through shared information, joint problem-solving, and agreed standards that benefit the entire supply chain.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Management should always accept whatever price the supplier demands without negotiation", "explanation": "Accepting all prices without negotiation fails to protect the business's financial interests and is not sustainable." },
        { "answer": "Suppliers should always agree to management's demands to avoid losing the contract", "explanation": "Constantly yielding to demands can drive suppliers out of business, ultimately harming the supply chain." },

      "question": "Assess the ethical implications of a large corporation using its market dominance to force suppliers into contracts that barely cover their production costs.",
      "correct": "It exploits the power imbalance and may drive suppliers out of business, reducing competition and harming the broader market",
      "correctExplanation": "Using dominant market position to squeeze suppliers raises ethical concerns about fairness, can eliminate smaller suppliers, and may reduce market competition over time.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It is always ethical because corporations have a duty to maximise profits above all else", "explanation": "While profitability matters, exploiting power imbalances raises ethical questions about fair dealing and long-term market health." },
        { "answer": "It has no ethical implications because suppliers freely choose to accept the contract", "explanation": "When suppliers depend on a dominant buyer, their 'choice' is constrained, raising questions about fairness and exploitation." },
        { "answer": "It benefits suppliers by motivating them to become more efficient and innovative", "explanation": "While some efficiency gains are possible, contracts that barely cover costs leave no resources for innovation or sustainable growth." }

      "question": "Evaluate how a breakdown in the management-supplier relationship could affect other stakeholder groups such as employees and customers.",
      "correct": "Supply disruptions can halt production, threatening employee job security and leaving customers without products",
      "correctExplanation": "When supplier relationships fail, the flow of inputs stops, which can shut down production lines, put employee jobs at risk, and prevent the business from serving customers.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "A supplier breakdown only affects management and has no impact on other stakeholders", "explanation": "Supply chain failures ripple through to employees, customers, shareholders, and the broader community." },
        { "answer": "Employees and customers benefit from supply disruptions because it creates time off", "explanation": "Production stoppages threaten employee income and leave customers unable to purchase needed products." },

      "question": "Compare the short-term and long-term consequences of management adopting an aggressive cost-cutting approach with suppliers versus a collaborative partnership approach.",
      "correct": "Aggressive cost-cutting yields quick savings but risks supply chain instability, while partnerships build resilience and mutual growth over time",
      "correctExplanation": "Aggressive tactics deliver immediate cost reductions but may damage supplier relationships and quality, whereas collaborative approaches create sustainable value for both parties.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Aggressive cost-cutting is always superior because lower costs guarantee long-term business success", "explanation": "Short-term cost savings can create long-term risks including quality decline, supplier failure, and supply disruptions." },
        { "answer": "Collaborative partnerships always cost more and never deliver any financial benefits to management", "explanation": "Partnerships can reduce total costs through better coordination, fewer defects, and more reliable supply." },
        { "answer": "There is no difference between the two approaches in either the short or long term", "explanation": "The approaches have significantly different impacts on cost, quality, reliability, and stakeholder relationships over time." }

      "correct": "Management must weigh cost savings against environmental damage, community expectations, and potential reputational harm",
      "correctExplanation": "This creates a multi-stakeholder dilemma: shareholders benefit from low costs, but the community, environment, and brand reputation are harmed by unethical practices.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There is no conflict because environmental practices are irrelevant to business management", "explanation": "Environmental practices directly affect community stakeholders, brand reputation, and increasingly, regulatory compliance." },
        { "answer": "Management should always choose the cheapest supplier regardless of environmental impact", "explanation": "Ignoring environmental harm risks community backlash, regulatory penalties, and long-term reputational damage." },
        { "answer": "The supplier's farming practices are solely the supplier's responsibility with no impact on the manufacturer", "explanation": "Modern consumers and regulators increasingly hold businesses accountable for their entire supply chain's practices." }

      "question": "Justify why a business might voluntarily pay suppliers above market rates, even though it increases costs.",
      "correct": "Above-market payments secure priority service, higher quality, and a more resilient supply chain during shortages",
      "correctExplanation": "Paying a premium builds supplier loyalty and ensures the business receives priority treatment, better quality, and reliable supply when market conditions tighten.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "No rational business would ever voluntarily pay above market rates for supplies", "explanation": "Many successful businesses pay premium prices to secure reliability, quality, and preferential treatment from key suppliers." },
        { "answer": "Paying above market rates always reduces business profitability with no offsetting benefits", "explanation": "Premium supplier relationships can reduce total costs through fewer defects, reliable delivery, and priority access during shortages." },

      "correct": "Open communication allows early identification of concerns, joint problem-solving, and negotiated compromises before conflicts escalate",
      "correctExplanation": "Regular, transparent communication helps both parties understand each other's constraints, identify issues early, and develop mutually acceptable solutions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Communication is irrelevant because conflicts between management and suppliers are always resolved by price alone", "explanation": "Many conflicts involve quality, delivery, and relationship issues that require dialogue beyond price negotiation." },
        { "answer": "Reducing communication prevents conflicts by ensuring neither party can raise complaints", "explanation": "Lack of communication allows misunderstandings and resentment to build, making eventual conflicts worse." },
        { "answer": "Management should only communicate with suppliers through formal legal proceedings", "explanation": "Legal proceedings are costly and adversarial. Regular business communication prevents most conflicts from reaching that point." }
