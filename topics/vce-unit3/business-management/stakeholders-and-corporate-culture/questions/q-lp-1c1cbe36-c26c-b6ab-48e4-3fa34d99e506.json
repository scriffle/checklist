      "question": "Assess the ethical dimensions of a business owner who knowingly pollutes to maintain profitability while community members suffer health consequences.",
      "correct": "It raises serious ethical concerns because the owner is prioritising private financial gain over public health and wellbeing",
      "correctExplanation": "Knowingly causing health harm to maximise profits violates principles of corporate social responsibility and stakeholder ethics.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There are no ethical dimensions because profit maximisation is the only business obligation", "explanation": "Modern business ethics recognises obligations to all stakeholders, not just profit maximisation for owners." },
        { "answer": "The ethical responsibility lies entirely with the community for living near the business", "explanation": "Businesses have an ethical duty to minimise harm to surrounding communities regardless of where residents choose to live." },

      "question": "Propose and justify a strategy that could resolve the conflict between a factory owner's profit motive and the community's demand for clean air.",
      "correct": "Invest in pollution controls gradually while adjusting pricing to recover costs, maintaining both profitability and community trust",
      "correctExplanation": "A phased approach allows the business to spread costs over time, maintain viability, and demonstrate good faith to the community, building long-term sustainability.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Permanently shut down the factory to eliminate all pollution immediately", "explanation": "Complete shutdown eliminates jobs and economic benefits; a balanced approach allows the business to continue while reducing environmental harm." },
        { "answer": "Relocate the factory to a region with no environmental regulations whatsoever", "explanation": "Relocating to avoid regulations is ethically questionable and still harms communities elsewhere; it does not resolve the underlying conflict." },
        { "answer": "Ignore all community complaints and continue operations without any changes at all", "explanation": "Ignoring complaints escalates the conflict and increases the risk of regulatory action, legal liability, and reputational damage." }

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Evaluate the effectiveness of government regulation as a mechanism for resolving conflicts between business owners and communities over pollution.",
      "correct": "Regulation sets minimum standards but may be insufficient without community monitoring and business willingness to exceed compliance",
      "correctExplanation": "Regulations provide a baseline but can be undermined by weak enforcement, loopholes, or businesses that only meet minimum requirements without genuine commitment to environmental responsibility.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Government regulation always perfectly resolves all environmental conflicts between owners and communities", "explanation": "Regulation alone cannot resolve all conflicts; enforcement challenges, political influence, and compliance gaps limit its effectiveness." },
        { "answer": "Government regulation is entirely unnecessary because businesses always self-regulate effectively", "explanation": "History shows that without regulation, many businesses prioritise cost savings over environmental protection." },
        { "answer": "Government regulation only benefits business owners and has no positive effect on communities", "explanation": "Environmental regulations are designed primarily to protect community health and the environment from business pollution." }

      "question": "A community group sues a factory for water contamination. The factory argues the cleanup cost would force it to close, eliminating 200 jobs. Evaluate this dilemma.",
      "correct": "Both outcomes involve significant stakeholder harm, requiring a solution that balances environmental remediation with employment preservation",
      "correctExplanation": "This illustrates a genuine stakeholder dilemma where environmental remediation and employment are both important community interests that must be balanced.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The factory should never be held accountable because employment is more important than environmental health", "explanation": "Both employment and environmental health are important stakeholder interests; neither automatically overrides the other." },
        { "answer": "The community should drop the lawsuit because businesses are never responsible for pollution", "explanation": "Businesses are legally and ethically responsible for pollution they cause, and communities have the right to seek remediation." },
        { "answer": "This dilemma has a simple solution because environmental and economic interests always perfectly align", "explanation": "Environmental and economic interests frequently conflict, which is precisely what makes this a genuine stakeholder dilemma." }

      "correctExplanation": "CSR encourages businesses to consider their environmental impact as part of core strategy, reducing the likelihood of pollution-related conflicts with the community.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "CSR principles have no relevance to environmental conflicts between owners and communities", "explanation": "Environmental responsibility is a core component of CSR and directly addresses the root causes of owner-community pollution conflicts." },
        { "answer": "CSR only requires businesses to donate to charity and has no environmental dimension", "explanation": "CSR encompasses environmental responsibility, ethical practices, and community engagement, not just charitable donations." },
        { "answer": "CSR principles always guarantee that no environmental conflict will ever occur between stakeholders", "explanation": "While CSR reduces the likelihood of conflict, it cannot guarantee that all stakeholder interests will always be perfectly aligned." }

      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Evaluate the argument that businesses creating pollution should be required to compensate affected communities financially. Consider both sides.",
      "correct": "Compensation acknowledges harm and creates financial incentives to reduce pollution, but may be seen as a licence to pollute if set too low",
      "correctExplanation": "Financial compensation recognises community damage and incentivises cleaner practices, but poorly designed schemes risk allowing businesses to simply pay to pollute rather than prevent harm.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Compensation is never appropriate because businesses have an absolute right to pollute freely", "explanation": "Businesses do not have an absolute right to pollute; they must operate within environmental regulations and ethical standards." },
        { "answer": "Compensation always perfectly resolves all environmental conflicts without any drawbacks", "explanation": "Compensation has limitations, including the risk of creating a 'licence to pollute' and difficulty quantifying environmental and health damage." },
        { "answer": "Compensation should only be paid to shareholders, never to affected community members", "explanation": "Affected community members bear the environmental and health costs, making them the appropriate recipients of compensation." }

      "correct": "Each party has legitimate but competing interests: the owner wants profitability, the resident wants health and safety, and the council must balance economic and environmental goals",
      "correctExplanation": "The difficulty arises because all three perspectives are valid. The owner's need for profitability, the resident's right to a safe environment, and the council's obligation to balance both create a complex multi-stakeholder challenge.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Environmental conflicts are easy to resolve because only one stakeholder's perspective is ever valid", "explanation": "All three stakeholders have legitimate interests, which is precisely why these conflicts are complex and difficult to resolve." },
        { "answer": "The conflict is simple because the business owner's perspective always takes legal precedence", "explanation": "No single stakeholder's interests automatically take precedence; councils must weigh community welfare against economic considerations." },
