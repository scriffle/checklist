      "question": "A car manufacturer introduces robots that reduce assembly time by 40% but requires a $5 million investment and the redundancy of 200 workers. Evaluate whether this improves efficiency.",
      "correct": "Efficiency improves long-term as output per dollar of input increases despite upfront costs",
      "correctExplanation": "Once the investment is absorbed, fewer inputs per unit produced means lasting efficiency gains, even though the transition involves significant costs.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Efficiency decreases because the technology investment is a large new cost", "explanation": "The initial investment is a one-off cost; ongoing efficiency is measured by the recurring output-to-input ratio." },
        { "answer": "Efficiency is unchanged because robots simply replace human labour inputs", "explanation": "If the robots produce more per dollar spent than the workers they replaced, the output-to-input ratio has improved." },
        { "answer": "Efficiency cannot be assessed until all 200 workers find new employment", "explanation": "Efficiency is measured by the business's input-output ratio, not by the employment status of former workers." }

      "correct": "Efficiency gains in one area may create negative consequences in another area",
      "correctExplanation": "Automating scheduling increases throughput per staff member but may reduce care quality if doctors feel rushed, illustrating trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The hospital has failed to improve efficiency in any meaningful way", "explanation": "Administrative efficiency has genuinely improved; the issue is that it created an unintended consequence for clinical care." },
        { "answer": "Doctors should accept reduced appointment gaps as a necessary cost", "explanation": "This ignores the trade-off between efficiency and the quality of patient care, which is a legitimate concern." },
        { "answer": "Automation always reduces quality in service-based organisations", "explanation": "Automation can improve both efficiency and quality when implemented thoughtfully; the issue is specific implementation choices." }

Bakery B focuses on artisan quality with handcrafted products. Bakery B charges higher prices and has loyal customers. Which analysis is most accurate?",
      "correct": "Different business strategies may prioritise different objectives over efficiency",
      "correctExplanation": "Bakery B demonstrates that some businesses succeed by prioritising quality and customer loyalty rather than production efficiency.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Bakery B is inefficient and will inevitably fail against Bakery A", "explanation": "Business success depends on many factors; Bakery B's loyal customer base and premium pricing may sustain profitability." },
        { "answer": "Bakery A is guaranteed to be more profitable than Bakery B", "explanation": "Lower costs do not guarantee higher profits if Bakery B earns higher revenue through premium pricing." },

      "correct": "Yes, the same output is achieved at a lower cost per unit of input",
      "correctExplanation": "Lower labour costs for the same output per worker means each dollar spent on labour produces more output, representing an efficiency gain.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "No, because output per worker has not changed at all", "explanation": "Efficiency can also be measured in financial terms; the same physical output at lower cost is more efficient use of financial resources." },
        { "answer": "No, because offshoring always reduces product quality", "explanation": "Quality outcomes depend on implementation; the efficiency question concerns cost-per-unit of output, which has improved." },
        { "answer": "Yes, but only if the offshore workers are faster", "explanation": "Speed is not the only measure; producing the same output at lower cost is itself an efficiency improvement." }

      "correctExplanation": "Small businesses may lack capital for technology investments or economies of scale, making some efficiency improvements impractical despite being theoretically beneficial.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The owner is correct because efficiency only matters for large businesses", "explanation": "Efficiency matters for all businesses; the issue is that available strategies may differ based on business size." },
        { "answer": "The owner is wrong because all efficiency improvements are cost-free", "explanation": "Many efficiency improvements require investment in technology, training, or reorganisation, which involves costs." },

      "correctExplanation": "Fewer staff handling the same transactions is more efficient, but the change may harm customer relationships, creating a tension between efficiency and service quality.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Efficiency has not improved because customer complaints increased", "explanation": "Efficiency is measured by the input-output ratio, which has improved; customer complaints relate to effectiveness, not efficiency." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "These objectives never conflict because they measure the same thing", "explanation": "Efficiency and effectiveness are distinct concepts; efficiency concerns resource use while effectiveness concerns goal achievement." },
