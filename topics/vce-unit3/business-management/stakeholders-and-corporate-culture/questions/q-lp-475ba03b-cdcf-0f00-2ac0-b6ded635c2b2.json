      "question": "Evaluate the argument that GBEs should be privatised because private sector businesses operate more efficiently. Consider both sides.",
      "correct": "Privatisation may improve efficiency but could reduce access to essential services for unprofitable communities",
      "correctExplanation": "Private ownership may drive cost-cutting but could lead to service withdrawal from areas where provision is costly, undermining the public service mandate.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Privatisation always improves every aspect of service delivery without any negative consequences", "explanation": "Privatisation has trade-offs; essential services may be reduced in less profitable areas when profit becomes the primary motive." },
        { "answer": "GBEs are always more efficient than private businesses so privatisation is never beneficial", "explanation": "Efficiency depends on management, not just ownership; the debate involves trade-offs between efficiency and access." },

      "correct": "The entity would gain independence but lose guaranteed government backing and funding",
      "correctExplanation": "As a social enterprise, the entity would operate more independently but without the financial safety net of government ownership, requiring it to be commercially sustainable.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The change would have no impact because GBEs and social enterprises are identical structures", "explanation": "These structures differ in ownership, funding and governance, making the conversion significant." },
        { "answer": "Converting to a social enterprise would automatically increase government funding substantially", "explanation": "Social enterprises are independent and generate their own revenue; they may lose government funding, not gain it." },

      "correct": "Compare systematically using criteria such as ownership, purpose, liability and profit distribution",
      "correctExplanation": "A structured comparison using consistent criteria ensures all key differences and similarities are identified and addressed for each business type.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Simply list everything you know about each business type without any organisational framework", "explanation": "Unstructured listing is less effective; systematic comparison using criteria demonstrates deeper analytical understanding." },

      "correctExplanation": "Private businesses optimise for profitability and may close unprofitable operations, while GBEs may maintain services in underserved areas as part of their public mandate.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both would immediately close the clinic because all businesses only pursue profit", "explanation": "GBEs have public service obligations that may require maintaining services that are not commercially viable." },

        { "answer": "The private chain would expand the clinic while the GBE would close it immediately", "explanation": "The opposite is more likely; the GBE has greater obligations to maintain access while the private chain focuses on profitability." }

      "correct": "Different structures serve different purposes that collectively meet diverse economic and social needs",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Australia maintains diverse structures only because it has not decided which single model is best", "explanation": "The diversity is deliberate policy; each structure serves a purpose that others cannot fulfil as effectively." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The student is correct because social enterprises and GBEs are identical in every way", "explanation": "They differ in ownership, governance, funding and accountability despite sharing some purpose overlap." },
        { "answer": "The student is correct because both are entirely funded by taxpayer money without revenue", "explanation": "Social enterprises generate their own revenue; GBEs also operate commercially. Neither relies solely on taxpayer funding." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Hybrid models are impossible because businesses must be either purely profit-driven or purely social", "explanation": "Many real businesses already combine profit and social elements, demonstrating that hybrid models are viable." },
