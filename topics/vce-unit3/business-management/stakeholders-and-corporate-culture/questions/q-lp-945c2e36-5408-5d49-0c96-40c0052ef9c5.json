        { "answer": "It cannot be genuine because large corporations are incapable of authentic social responsibility", "explanation": "Large corporations can and do make genuine CSR commitments. The sustained scale of the SecondBite partnership supports its authenticity." },
        { "answer": "It is irrelevant whether the commitment is genuine because external stakeholders never notice CSR activities", "explanation": "External stakeholders pay close attention to CSR activities, and perceived authenticity directly influences trust and loyalty." }

      "question": "Compare the effectiveness of CSR as a differentiation strategy for a large supermarket like Coles versus a small independent grocery store.",
      "correct": "Coles has greater resources to implement large-scale CSR but a small store may achieve stronger local community connection",
      "correctExplanation": "Large businesses can fund significant programs, while small businesses may build deeper, more personal stakeholder relationships within their community.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "CSR is only effective for large businesses and provides no benefit to small businesses", "explanation": "Small businesses can benefit significantly from CSR through strong local community relationships and word-of-mouth reputation." },
        { "answer": "Small businesses always outperform large businesses in CSR because they have more money", "explanation": "Small businesses typically have fewer financial resources than large corporations. Their CSR advantage lies in community connection, not budget." },

      "correct": "It would likely damage community trust and customer loyalty built over ten years of consistent CSR activity",
      "correctExplanation": "Discontinuing a long-standing CSR program would signal a retreat from social responsibility, potentially eroding the trust and loyalty it created.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There would be no consequences because customers do not remember past CSR activities", "explanation": "A decade-long public partnership creates significant awareness. Discontinuation would be noticed and could trigger negative reactions." },
        { "answer": "Customers would immediately switch to another supermarket that has never had any CSR program", "explanation": "While some customers might switch, they would likely move to competitors with stronger CSR credentials, not those with none." },

      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Justify why a business should invest in CSR activities that benefit external stakeholders, even when the financial return is uncertain.",
      "correct": "Because long-term stakeholder trust and loyalty often generate sustainable competitive advantages that outweigh short-term costs",
      "correctExplanation": "While immediate financial returns may be uncertain, CSR builds intangible assets like reputation and loyalty that support long-term business success.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because all CSR investments guarantee immediate and measurable profit increases", "explanation": "CSR returns are often long-term and indirect. The justification lies in sustained competitive advantages, not guaranteed immediate profits." },
        { "answer": "Because the government reimburses all CSR expenditure in full every financial year", "explanation": "There is no government reimbursement for CSR. The justification is based on long-term strategic benefits like trust and differentiation." },
        { "answer": "Because businesses that do not invest in CSR are automatically declared bankrupt", "explanation": "There is no legal consequence of this nature. CSR investment is justified by its long-term contribution to trust and competitive positioning." }

      "correct": "Social media amplifies both positive CSR efforts and stakeholder criticism, increasing accountability",
      "correctExplanation": "Social media makes CSR activities more visible to external stakeholders and also enables rapid criticism if businesses fail to meet their commitments.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Social media has no impact on CSR because external stakeholders do not use digital platforms", "explanation": "External stakeholders actively use social media to research and respond to business CSR activities." },
        { "answer": "Social media only spreads negative information about CSR and never positive stories", "explanation": "Social media spreads both positive CSR stories and criticism, depending on the authenticity and impact of the activities." },
        { "answer": "Social media has eliminated the need for CSR because businesses can now advertise directly", "explanation": "Social media has actually increased the importance of CSR by making stakeholders more informed and demanding of genuine responsibility." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Copy Coles' SecondBite partnership exactly without any original community engagement", "explanation": "Simply copying a competitor's CSR program lacks authenticity. Effective CSR requires genuine commitment to a cause aligned with the business's values." },
        { "answer": "Make large but vague promises about sustainability without any specific actions or measurements", "explanation": "Vague promises without measurable actions risk being perceived as greenwashing, damaging rather than building stakeholder trust." },
