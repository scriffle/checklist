      "correctExplanation": "Social impact metrics provide a comprehensive view of how business operations affect the community across multiple dimensions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Community impact cannot be measured because it is entirely subjective and unquantifiable", "explanation": "Many tools exist to measure social impact including surveys, environmental audits, economic multiplier studies, and social return on investment." },
