      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [

      "correctExplanation": "While high retention reduces immediate dividends, successful reinvestment can significantly increase the company's value and future returns, ultimately benefiting shareholders.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is entirely correct because shareholders should always receive maximum dividends from every profit period", "explanation": "Distributing all profits would prevent reinvestment and could harm the business's competitive position and long-term shareholder value." },
        { "answer": "The claim is entirely wrong because shareholders have no right to receive any portion of company profits", "explanation": "Shareholders do have a legitimate expectation of returns. The key question is whether retention today generates greater value than dividends now." },
        { "answer": "The claim is irrelevant because directors never retain profits in real companies", "explanation": "Profit retention is a common and necessary practice. Most companies retain at least a portion of profits for reinvestment." }

      "question": "Assess whether a company that pays high dividends but underinvests in its operations is making a sustainable decision.",
      "correct": "It is not sustainable because inadequate reinvestment will erode competitive advantage and reduce future profitability",
      "correctExplanation": "Without reinvestment in equipment, technology, and operations, the company risks falling behind competitors and generating lower profits over time, ultimately reducing dividends.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It is always sustainable because high dividends guarantee continued shareholder investment in the company", "explanation": "High dividends at the expense of operations will eventually reduce profitability, leading to lower dividends and declining share prices." },
        { "answer": "It is sustainable as long as the company never needs to replace any of its existing equipment or infrastructure", "explanation": "All businesses eventually need to upgrade or replace assets. Failing to reinvest means falling behind in capability and efficiency." },
        { "answer": "It has no long-term consequences because businesses do not need ongoing investment to remain profitable", "explanation": "Ongoing investment is essential for maintaining competitiveness, adapting to market changes, and sustaining profitability." }

      "question": "Propose a governance mechanism that could reduce conflict between shareholders and directors over profit distribution.",
      "correct": "Establishing a transparent dividend policy that clearly communicates the criteria for determining payout levels each year",
      "correctExplanation": "A transparent policy reduces uncertainty by letting shareholders understand how dividend decisions are made, linking them to measurable business performance indicators.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Removing all shareholder voting rights so directors can make decisions without interference", "explanation": "Removing voting rights would undermine corporate governance and increase distrust, likely intensifying rather than reducing conflict." },
        { "answer": "Paying identical dividends every year regardless of business performance or reinvestment needs", "explanation": "Fixed dividends ignore changing business conditions and can lead to either underpayment in good years or unsustainable payments in poor years." },
        { "answer": "Eliminating the board of directors and letting each individual shareholder decide their own dividend", "explanation": "This would create chaos in corporate governance. Dividends must be set consistently for all shareholders by the governing body." }

      "question": "Evaluate how the conflict between shareholders and directors over dividends reflects the broader challenge of stakeholder management in business.",
      "correct": "It illustrates that limited resources must be allocated among groups with competing interests, requiring ongoing negotiation and compromise",
      "correctExplanation": "The dividends-versus-reinvestment debate is a microcosm of stakeholder management: multiple legitimate interests compete for the same limited resources.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It shows that stakeholder conflict is impossible to manage and businesses should ignore all stakeholder concerns", "explanation": "While challenging, stakeholder conflicts can be managed through communication, transparency, and strategic compromise." },
        { "answer": "It demonstrates that only one stakeholder group can ever be considered in business decision-making processes", "explanation": "Effective management involves considering multiple stakeholder perspectives and finding balanced solutions, not focusing on one group." },
        { "answer": "It proves that businesses would be more successful if they had no shareholders at all", "explanation": "Shareholders provide essential capital. The challenge is managing the relationship, not eliminating it." }

      "question": "A company's directors retain 90% of profits to fund an overseas expansion. Two years later the expansion fails and the company loses value. Evaluate the directors' decision from a shareholder perspective.",
      "correct": "Shareholders were denied dividends for a risky venture that destroyed value, suggesting directors failed in their duty to balance risk and return",
      "correctExplanation": "The failed expansion shows that retaining profits carries risk. Shareholders sacrificed dividends for a strategy that ultimately reduced company value, raising questions about director judgment.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Shareholders should be grateful because the directors attempted to grow the business regardless of outcome", "explanation": "Good intentions do not justify poor outcomes. Shareholders legitimately question whether the retained profits would have been better distributed as dividends." },
        { "answer": "The failure has no relevance to the dividend decision because expansion always carries zero risk", "explanation": "Expansion carries significant risk. The decision to retain profits must weigh potential returns against the risk of failure." },
        { "answer": "Directors bear no responsibility because shareholders agreed to buy shares in a company that makes investments", "explanation": "While shareholders accept some risk, directors still have a fiduciary duty to make sound decisions and cannot dismiss accountability for failed strategies." }

      "correct": "The retiree would likely prefer high dividends for income, while the superannuation fund may support reinvestment for long-term capital growth",
      "correctExplanation": "Different shareholders have different needs: retirees need current income from dividends, while superannuation funds invest over decades and benefit more from capital appreciation.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both would always prefer identical dividend policies regardless of their financial circumstances", "explanation": "Shareholder preferences are influenced by individual financial needs, investment horizons, and risk tolerance." },
        { "answer": "The retiree would prefer zero dividends while the superannuation fund demands maximum dividend payouts", "explanation": "This reverses the typical preference. Retirees need income now, while superannuation funds can afford to wait for long-term gains." },
        { "answer": "Neither would care about dividends because share ownership provides no financial benefits to investors", "explanation": "Both dividends and capital growth provide financial benefits. The preference between them depends on the investor's circumstances." }

      "question": "Justify why a business might choose to issue a special one-off dividend alongside a strategy of generally retaining profits for reinvestment.",
      "correct": "To reward shareholders after an exceptionally profitable period while maintaining the long-term reinvestment strategy",
      "correctExplanation": "A special dividend acknowledges shareholder expectations during unusually high profits without abandoning the broader strategy of retaining earnings for growth.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because special dividends are legally required whenever a company earns above-average profits", "explanation": "There is no legal requirement for special dividends. They are a discretionary decision by the board to manage shareholder relations." },
        { "answer": "Because paying a special dividend eliminates all future conflict between shareholders and directors", "explanation": "A one-off payment does not resolve the underlying tension. Future profit periods will present the same allocation debate." },
        { "answer": "Because the company has no possible use for any excess profit beyond normal reinvestment", "explanation": "Companies can always find uses for capital. A special dividend is a strategic choice to balance stakeholder interests, not a sign of having no investment options." }

      "correct": "It can be ethical if directors genuinely believe reinvestment will create greater value for all stakeholders, but transparency about their reasoning is essential",
      "correctExplanation": "Directors have a fiduciary duty to act in the company's best interests. Prioritising reinvestment is ethical if the decision is well-reasoned, communicated clearly, and genuinely aimed at long-term value creation.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It is always unethical because shareholders are the only stakeholders whose interests should ever be considered", "explanation": "While shareholders are important, ethical business management considers the interests of all stakeholders including employees and the community." },
