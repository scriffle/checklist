TITLE: I can describe the key reasons why businesses are important to the Australian economy
CODE: 1.1

WHAT (concept explanation):
Businesses contribute to the economy by manufacturing and selling goods or providing services, creating employment, generating taxation revenue for the government, driving innovation and product development, and providing infrastructure.

WHY (importance):
Recognising the broader economic role of businesses helps explain why governments regulate and support them.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A regional manufacturing company creates 50 local jobs, pays company tax to the ATO, and supplies products to both domestic and international customers.

SUBTOPIC: Types of Businesses Overview
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic introduces the Australian mixed market economy and the distinction between the private and public sectors. It covers the six types of business structures and why businesses matter to the economy.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding how different businesses are structured helps explain why owners choose particular legal forms and how those choices affect liability, control and growth potential.

TOPIC: Business foundations
SUBJECT: Business Management | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: An exploration of the types of businesses operating in Australia and the objectives that guide their decision-making and strategic direction.

CHAPTER 2
Stakeholders and corporate
culture
‘I think it is going to be very difficult to be a company in silos. I think
the game has changed. We won’t define our success by looking at the
competitors but at how satisfied are our customers, how engaged are our
internal stakeholders, and how good is our product pipeline.’
Michael Dell (1965–)
About the author:
Michael Dell is the founder, chairman and CEO of Dell
Technologies, one of the world’s largest technology
infrastructure companies.
KICKSTARTER ACTIVITY
Work with a partner. Read the quotation about business stakeholders
and discuss your response to the following questions:
1 What does the concept of ‘silos’ mean when referring to businesses?
2 What approach does Michael Dell put forward as the key to success of the
modern business?
CHAPTER OVERVIEW
This chapter examines the key characteristics of the stakeholders of
a business. Regardless of the size of the business, some stakeholders
may influence the business in a positive way while others may
experience conflict with the business. Both groups of stakeholders,
however, have an effect on the success of the business. Corporate
culture, whether official or real, is also examined. It is important for a
business to have a positive corporate culture and to have strategies in
place to develop the culture of that business.

At each level of the business
environment (macro, operating
and internal), there are
stakeholders or pressures
that impact directly on the
business. A stakeholder can
either affect or be affected by
the operations of a business.
Ideally, all stakeholders should
want the business to achieve
its aims or objectives. In reality,
this does not occur, as various
stakeholders (e.g. a competitor)
would have conflicting interests.
In addition, the needs of
stakeholders can actually be
at variance with each other.
Lobby groups interested in the
environment may have interests
that differ from the interests
of those who believe the only
purpose of a business is to make
a sizeable profit. Success comes
from working out strategies
to overcome or satisfy these
varying interests.
Figure 2.1 Stakeholders can have a significant effect on the success of a
business.
The major stakeholders of a business, together with their most likely interests and issues, are
identified in Table 2.1. These stakeholders are generally drawn from the internal and operating
environment of the business.

Business owners/

Shareholders The amount of profit to be distributed at the end
of the year. The shareholders want to receive a
substantial dividend. Owners/directors want to
distribute a smaller portion of the profit, retaining
an amount for building the business.
Management Suppliers Suppliers want to be ensured a guaranteed supplier
relationship where the price paid is fair and is paid
promptly. Management wants to ensure that the
quality of the goods being supplied is consistent,
supplied on time and of high standard, but at the
lowest cost possible.
Business owners Community Business operations may cause environmental
issues due to the business owners not installing
or failing to maintain equipment, resulting in
pollution (air or water). Community wants to live in
an environmentally friendly area with no danger to
community from pollutants.
Management Customers Reduced quality of goods and services provided
to customers with no reduction in prices being
charged. Customers are looking for quality goods
for a reasonable price (i.e. not being overcharged or
under-serviced).
ACTIVITY 2.1
Changing retail environment in Australia
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operating conditions of retailers has been
substantial. Long-established department stores such as Myer, David Jones and Harris Scarfe,
and their discount equivalents Kmart, Big W and Best & Less, are in a state of uncertainty about
future viability. Added to this uncertainty is the further pressure as online stores, such as Temple &
Webster and Kogan, increasingly gain market share. This is, however, not just an Australian issue
but is happening worldwide.
The following is a list of strategies that these businesses could adopt to ensure their ongoing
profitability:
•
Reduce the number of stores, which are costly to run both in terms of lease payments and
not creating sufficient sales revenue.
•
Concentrate on ensuring that large flagship stores carry stock that is appealing to
customers and create a point of difference from online stores.
•
Be prepared to take one large write-down or readjustment of the business operations to
ensure that the restructure takes place.
•
Ensure that shareholders understand that the write-down is part of the overall business
strategy to increase the profitability of the business.
•
Increase the online presence of the traditional retail stores.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

1 Identify the stakeholders of the major department stores and their discount equivalents.
Describe the nature of the interests that the above stakeholders have with these businesses.
2 Identify the stakeholders of the online stores.
3 Compare the interests of the stakeholders of the major department stores and online stores.
4 Identify and describe any potential conflicts that may occur between the large department
stores and the online stores.
ACTIVITY 2.2
Retail environment in Australia
1 Identify and describe the stakeholders that you believe would have a particular interest in
the operations of the following smaller-sized businesses:
a online clothes designer shop
b online catering company
c florist shop in local strip shopping centre
d local family-run restaurant.
2 Choose two from the four examples of businesses listed in Question 1. For each of these
two business examples, identify two stakeholders and describe the conflicting interests
they would have in each of those businesses. For instance, if the business is a local fruit
shop, the customers would want that shop to be open seven days a week. However, the
owners of that family business would not want to open every day, as they would not be
able to provide fresh produce on a Sunday as the wholesale fruit and vegetable market
would be closed. In addition, it would have a significant impact on their family life if they
opened the shop on Sundays and worked in the shop themselves.
ethics a set of

Corporate social responsibility is traditionally broken into four areas: environmental,
philanthropic, ethical and economic responsibility. Both internal and external stakeholders of
a business can be affected by the activities of that business in the way they address these four
areas of corporate social responsibility. A business that acts in a socially responsible manner
and has sustainable business operations creates a series of benefits for the community and
the environment. To be perceived by the community as socially responsible potentially creates
a positive reputation for the business. Additionally, it creates more possibilities for retaining
quality employees (internal stakeholders) by positively affecting their levels of satisfaction,
motivation and loyalty to the business. This aligns with human resource objectives of reducing
levels of staff turnover and improving levels of employee satisfaction.
If the business can communicate its positive socially responsible activities to external
stakeholders (e.g. its customers and the community), attaining objectives such as increasing
levels of consumer satisfaction and trust will be easier, and will result in creating an
improvement in customer loyalty to both the business and its products and services.
Establishing that a business exhibits a high level of corporate social responsibility provides that
business with a point of differentiation from its competitors.

Stakeholders want businesses to recognise the importance of these four areas and incorporate
them into their business objectives. Businesses must be ethical in the types of products
they manufacture and services they provide. The Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Commonwealth) establishes guidelines for businesses relating to disclosure of information
on product performance, composition, contents, design, construction and packaging, and
the form and manner in which this information is included with the goods when sold. Many
businesses take their responsibility to the community and the environment very seriously by

going beyond being legally compliant to becoming signatories to the Australian Packaging
Covenant. The Australian Packaging Covenant Strategic Plan 2017–2022 was created and set
as one of its targets ‘to tangibly reduce landfill’. The plan states that businesses must adopt a
corporate socially responsible approach to achieve this target. Revised targets (2025 Targets)
have now been developed, providing a framework for collective, national action on waste
management, recycling and resource recovery for product packaging. They include:
•
•
•
•
100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging
70 per cent of plastic packaging being recycled or composted
50 per cent of average recycled content included in packaging (revised from 30 per cent in
2020 target)
the phasing out of problematic and unnecessary single-use plastics packaging.
These new targets were developed following extensive industry and government consultation
and align with global packaging initiatives. If achieved, they will be an important step on
Australia’s journey towards a circular economy for packaging.
To help our community overcome this complex issue, businesses of all sizes need to adopt
corporate social responsibility objectives and strategies. One large business wholeheartedly
adopting this approach to help our planet is Woolworths. Adopting the mantra ‘Growing
greener every day’ as part of its CSR strategy to create a healthier planet, Woolworths
has redesigned packaging to use 75 per cent less plastic than previous packaging, and
implemented its REDcycle Program, which, since its inception in 2017, has collected in excess of
900 million pieces of soft plastics (i.e. 3700 tonnes). This soft plastic is being upcycled to make
customer benches and car-park bollards. Woolworths has set a target of having 100 per cent of
its Home Brand packaging being reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2023. Woolworths is
also ensuring that its own brand tissues, toilet paper and kitchen towels are responsibly sourced
and independently certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.
In June 2022, Woolworths announced that it would completely remove plastic shopping bags.
In 2018, free single-use plastic bags were replaced by 15-cent reusable bags, and the 2022
announcement said that these would now be phased out over a 12-month period.
ACTIVITY 2.3
1 Identify and describe the CSR strategies adopted by Woolworths to assist in creating a
healthier planet.

website and look at the ‘Corporate

Social responsibility requires a business to be working to improve its positive impact on
society and to reduce any negative impact it may have. Westpac, one of Australia’s largest
banks, believes that it must conduct its business to meet its financial, social and environmental
responsibilities. To do this, it needs to establish a set of values and behaviours that underpin its
everyday activities in how it conducts its dealings with its internal and external stakeholders,
namely its people (employees), customers and the community.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

examples of business management
Corporate culture is an internal factor that management seeks to influence in the hope
of optimising business performance. A positive culture that encourages productivity
improvement, sets high standards of quality in products and services, seeks employee
engagement and motivates everyone to do their best work is crucial to the competitiveness
and success of a business.
corporate culture
system of shared
values and beliefs
of people within a
business
One business leader putting this into practice is Ken Boal, vice-president of Cisco Australia and
New Zealand, proud winner of the 50 Best Places to Work in Australia 2020 (more than 1000
employees category). He believes that Cisco’s improved workplace culture has come about
through increased transparency and trust, and the company’s greater purpose to power an
inclusive future.
Peter Drucker, hailed as the father of modern management, believed that
managers above everything else should be leaders within their businesses and
are duty-bound to ensure that a desired corporate culture is established and
maintained in a business. Stakeholders – and in particular, employees – should
be able to discern the differences between the official culture and the real culture
that exists within a business. Strategies can be used by a business to develop
and implement the desired corporate culture. The internal culture of a business
is in fact its personality and is an important determinant of how effectively and
efficiently a business functions. It is the role of the leadership team to monitor
and put in place strategies to develop and alter the culture of a business.
Corporate culture is often summed up with the phrase ‘it’s how we do things
around here’. It is a system of values and beliefs shared by the people within
a business. It determines how people behave, act towards one another and
what is, or isn’t, accepted behaviour. It reflects the shared view of the direction
and values, priorities and commitments, as well as feelings of loyalty and
personal worth within the business. Culture has both observable and non-
observable elements.
Corporate culture is:
•
•
•
•
a pattern of basic shared assumptions within a business
developed and shared by a group
representative of things that worked well in the past and are considered valid within the
business
taught to newcomers as the ‘correct’ way of thinking, feeling and doing.

Ronnie Altit, co-founder and chief executive
of Insentra, an Australian IT provider, states
that ‘culture is at the top of my list as CEO,
it’s the number one thing I focus on’. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, Insentra, which
employs 54 people, was able to retain all of
its employees. Looking after those employees
involved ‘a whole bunch of things’ to keep the
crew motivated and in touch with each other,
such as weekly cooking challenges, an ‘iso fit’
health challenge and virtual trivia. Altit says
he makes a conscious effort to make himself
as accessible as possible to everyone. He had
weekly ‘45 minutes with Ronnie’ team calls,
which provided an opportunity for employees
to ask questions and banter with each other,
and allowed Ronnie to find out more about
his team. It has meant that the casual ‘water
cooler’ chats now occur virtually.

Official and real corporate culture
Businesses are very aware of the importance of developing a positive corporate culture. The
first step to developing and promoting a desired culture is to establish the official corporate
culture. The official or desired culture is, however, not always reflected in existing real
(unofficial) culture.

Strategies to develop corporate culture (official and real)
The culture of a business is a crucial determinant of its efficiency, effectiveness and therefore
productivity. Developing a positive corporate culture for a business relies on the strategies or
factors shown in Figure 2.8.

The creation of formal written mission, vision and values statements
Many businesses refer to their corporate culture as ‘organisational culture’, which encompasses
their mission, objectives, expectations and values that guide their employees. Businesses that
adopt an organisational culture tend to be more
successful than less structured businesses because
they have systems in place to promote employee
performance, productivity and engagement.
The mission statement defines the purpose of a
business or its reason for being. It also indicates
the way a business will be managed. The vision
statement formally sets out the business’s
aspirations or what the business is aiming to
achieve. Creating a values statement outlines what
the business wants to recognise as its corporate/
business values – for example, integrity, honesty,
fairness and responsibility. The values identified
in this statement are those that are held to be
important to people within the business. For
instance, if the corporate culture of a business
strongly acknowledges its corporate social

responsibility to society and the environment,
corporate culture.
it will be regarded more favourably by its
stakeholders. This approach should help to drive
better financial results. On the other hand, a strong corporate culture that is not in tune with the
environment will hinder a business more than a weak corporate culture. These three documents
act as the starting point for identification and establishment of a desired culture. They provide
the purpose with which all decisions made in the business must align.

Establishing management structures
The way in which the different parts of a business are formally arranged, linking management,
employees and their functions, can help to shape its corporate culture. The structure of a
business determines how work tasks are divided and coordinated. It also indicates who holds
authority and the relationships between different parts of the business.
The features of a management structure are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
division of labour – who does what
segmentation of employees into departments or divisions
chain of command, control and authority – who is responsible to whom and for what
communication channels – downward, upward and lateral
the patterns of decision-making – centralised or decentralised
the number of layers in the management hierarchy.
Traditional businesses have operated under a hierarchical structure that features three distinct
levels of management. Senior/executive management, the top level in the management
hierarchy, is responsible for the strategic or long-term planning of the business. It is required
to work closely with the board of directors (if a company) to establish the mission, vision and
values statements. Middle-level managers are the next level in the hierarchy: each manager
is responsible for one division or department. Front-line managers, often referred to as team
leaders or supervisors, have responsibility for the day-to-day planning and decision-making in
the business. It is the responsibility of all three levels of management to ensure that the official
corporate culture of the business is understood by the workers.
Many businesses have moved away from the traditional hierarchical structure, hoping to
become more dynamic in their operations, be more responsive to changes in the business
environment, and increase levels of productivity and competitiveness. Removing layers
(delayering) of management has meant that some management roles and responsibilities have
been taken over by employee work groups or teams. This change in structure has resulted in
significant workplace changes, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
greater employee involvement in participative decision-making
increased level of employee engagement
decentralisation of power
improved motivation
improved communication flow and transparency
less status distinction (e.g. offices)
a move away from autocratic management styles to adopting consultative
and participative styles

Choice of management styles
Management styles refer to the different ways that managers in a business behave. The
preferred style of a manager will depend on many factors, such as cultural styles of leadership
and the type of business they are managing. For instance, an autocratic style will suit a
highly structured business, where great emphasis is placed on achieving tasks and following
established processes. These managers place little value on the level of job satisfaction
employees gain when contributing to the overall performance of the business. The objectives,
aims and operating environments reflect the ideas, beliefs and values of the manager.
In contrast, a manager who uses the participative style to manage their subordinates places
emphasis on ensuring that workers gain job satisfaction as well as achieving their assigned
work tasks. Greater emphasis is placed on the employees’ contribution to the process of
decision-making, and communication is open.
A business that adopts a management style that is more employee-centred demonstrates that
it values the contribution of its workers and places trust and faith in their abilities. This would
result in creating a more positive corporate culture than an organisation that is totally task-
oriented and adopts an autocratic management style.
policy a written
statement of

procedures, rules
and regulations
Implementation of policies
A policy is a written statement detailing processes, procedures, rules and regulations that must
be observed in a given situation. In effect, a policy tells employees what to do and how to do it
in a given situation. When establishing and reinforcing the corporate culture of a business, the
policies and practices within a business should reflect the values of that business. Policies are
designed to establish standards of behaviour and guiding principles on actions that should be
taken in a given situation. This assists in developing and reinforcing the corporate culture by:
•
establishing consistency. For instance, suppose a business sets out a ‘social media usage’
policy that establishes the guidelines for the non-usage of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
TikTok and YouTube while at the workplace and during working hours. This means that any
employee caught breaking that rule will be subject to the same sanction.
•
setting out procedures. Procedures are a series of steps that must be followed to implement
the policy. These procedures will guarantee actions that reflect the values and mission of the
business.

identifying how potential conflict situations can be resolved
complying with and accepting desired behaviours within the business.
Official business documentation and forms of communication
The branding of a business is an important factor when developing the official corporate
culture of that business. It represents the way the customers view the business. It is therefore
important when designing business documentation, such as a letterhead or a logo, that it
clearly represents the public image the business wishes to convey. The language used in the
documentation can also indicate whether there is a formal or informal culture. Also, specific
or specialist language, such as jargon and acronyms, can act to bind employees within a
workplace. For instance, schools use educational jargon such as VCAA, VCE, GAT, SAC and ATAR.
People
The culture of a business is reflected in its people.
Employees are an important determinant and indicator
of culture. If a level of formality between management
and employees is required in the workplace, the way
people greet each other can achieve this – for example,
by using courtesy titles such as Mr, Mrs, Dr or Professor
when greeting fellow workers. A less formal culture
would place emphasis on greeting a person (manager
or worker) using their first name.
If a business wants to create a corporate culture
that celebrates diversity in its people, it can use its
recruitment policies to achieve this objective. Diversity
can be created by ensuring that there is a mix of
workers of different genders, with different ethnic
backgrounds and with differing ages, skills and levels of
experience. Diversity acts to enrich the corporate culture.
Figure 2.10 Diversity enriches corporate culture, and it is imperative
that businesses strive to hire people from diverse backgrounds, ages
and skill sets.
Having the ‘right’ people who share the core values of the business or possess a willingness to
embrace those values will assist the business to build a coherent culture. Thought, planning
and effort must be put into attracting, retaining, rewarding and developing people (employees)
with the right cultural fit and attitude.
In our current business environment, it is important that businesses value their workers both
for their contribution to the success of the business and as private individuals. The attitude of
the business to assisting its workers to create work–life balance can be used as an indicator of
whether the culture of that business is positive.

leading retailer of home improvement and
outdoor living products, and a major supplier
to project builders, commercial tradespeople
and the housing industry.
Bunnings engages with the communities in
which it operates, and actively contributes to
causes and organisations that benefit these
communities.
It employs more than 50 000 team members
(June 2022), and has a stated ambition to

Physical environment and material symbols
Physical environment is a significant indicator of
culture. Open-plan offices, for example, promote lateral
communication, team building and collaboration. The
location of a business also affects its culture. For example, an
inner-city ‘hipster’ location will promote an entirely different
culture from a business located in an outer suburban area.
Similarly, a traditional CBD location will promote a different
culture from a business in a rural location.
Material symbols representing status in an organisation are
another physical indicator. For instance, do senior managers
have bigger offices than middle managers? Are there
separate cafeterias for blue-collar and white-collar workers?
Other physical indicators of culture can include colour and
design of staff uniforms or the colour used in the decoration of the office space.

ACTIVITY 2.7
1 Brainstorm some examples of the observable elements of corporate culture. Then, select a
business you are familiar with and identify the observable elements of its corporate culture.
2 Explain why it is important for a business to maintain an appealing official corporate
culture.
3 Identify potential consequences to a business if its ‘real corporate culture’ is judged as
being ‘toxic’.
Stories, narratives and rituals
The importance of creating stories and narratives about
significant events and/or people in the business, such as its
founders, cannot be overlooked. The people about whom
stories are told often then become ‘heroes’ for that business.
Displaying pictures of these people in the foyer or reception
area will show the pride and esteem in which they are valued.
Establishing and acknowledging rituals that express key
values and expectations within a business should be
encouraged. Examples of these are recognition and reward
ceremonies, weekly social get-togethers, participating in
social club activities or the annual Christmas party. These
rituals help to underscore the importance placed on the
positive benefits gained through social interaction in the
workplace and the celebration of a job well done.
Figure 2.12 Office celebrations strengthen employee relations and
highlight the importance of acknowledging good work.
A positive corporate culture is a vital component for any business in developing and
maintaining its competitive edge. While a business will have developed an official corporate
culture by implementing the strategies outlined in this chapter, observing the real culture will
show what is actually occurring. The COVID-19 pandemic has been among the most stressful
and challenging times that current businesses and employees have experienced. Hard times
reflect character in both individuals and businesses. If a business has survived, and adapted in
the way it serves its customers, employees and stakeholders during this challenging period,
then it is demonstrating a positive culture in action.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

TARGET: Basic recall and recognition.
TEST: Can student retrieve relevant knowledge from memory?
QUESTION TYPES: Define terms, identify components, recall facts, match definitions.
STEMS: "What is...", "Which of the following is...", "The term for... is...", "Identify the..."
AVOID: Application, inference, or synthesis. Test recognition, not deeper understanding.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can describe the key reasons why businesses are important to the Australian economy
CODE: 1.1

WHAT (concept explanation):
Businesses contribute to the economy by manufacturing and selling goods or providing services, creating employment, generating taxation revenue for the government, driving innovation and product development, and providing infrastructure.

WHY (importance):
Recognising the broader economic role of businesses helps explain why governments regulate and support them.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A regional manufacturing company creates 50 local jobs, pays company tax to the ATO, and supplies products to both domestic and international customers.

SUBTOPIC: Types of Businesses Overview
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic introduces the Australian mixed market economy and the distinction between the private and public sectors. It covers the six types of business structures and why businesses matter to the economy.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding how different businesses are structured helps explain why owners choose particular legal forms and how those choices affect liability, control and growth potential.

TOPIC: Business foundations
SUBJECT: Business Management | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: An exploration of the types of businesses operating in Australia and the objectives that guide their decision-making and strategic direction.

CHAPTER 2
Stakeholders and corporate
culture
‘I think it is going to be very difficult to be a company in silos. I think
the game has changed. We won’t define our success by looking at the
competitors but at how satisfied are our customers, how engaged are our
internal stakeholders, and how good is our product pipeline.’
Michael Dell (1965–)
About the author:
Michael Dell is the founder, chairman and CEO of Dell
Technologies, one of the world’s largest technology
infrastructure companies.
KICKSTARTER ACTIVITY
Work with a partner. Read the quotation about business stakeholders
and discuss your response to the following questions:
1 What does the concept of ‘silos’ mean when referring to businesses?
2 What approach does Michael Dell put forward as the key to success of the
modern business?
CHAPTER OVERVIEW
This chapter examines the key characteristics of the stakeholders of
a business. Regardless of the size of the business, some stakeholders
may influence the business in a positive way while others may
experience conflict with the business. Both groups of stakeholders,
however, have an effect on the success of the business. Corporate
culture, whether official or real, is also examined. It is important for a
business to have a positive corporate culture and to have strategies in
place to develop the culture of that business.

At each level of the business
environment (macro, operating
and internal), there are
stakeholders or pressures
that impact directly on the
business. A stakeholder can
either affect or be affected by
the operations of a business.
Ideally, all stakeholders should
want the business to achieve
its aims or objectives. In reality,
this does not occur, as various
stakeholders (e.g. a competitor)
would have conflicting interests.
In addition, the needs of
stakeholders can actually be
at variance with each other.
Lobby groups interested in the
environment may have interests
that differ from the interests
of those who believe the only
purpose of a business is to make
a sizeable profit. Success comes
from working out strategies
to overcome or satisfy these
varying interests.
Figure 2.1 Stakeholders can have a significant effect on the success of a
business.
The major stakeholders of a business, together with their most likely interests and issues, are
identified in Table 2.1. These stakeholders are generally drawn from the internal and operating
environment of the business.

Business owners/

Shareholders The amount of profit to be distributed at the end
of the year. The shareholders want to receive a
substantial dividend. Owners/directors want to
distribute a smaller portion of the profit, retaining
an amount for building the business.
Management Suppliers Suppliers want to be ensured a guaranteed supplier
relationship where the price paid is fair and is paid
promptly. Management wants to ensure that the
quality of the goods being supplied is consistent,
supplied on time and of high standard, but at the
lowest cost possible.
Business owners Community Business operations may cause environmental
issues due to the business owners not installing
or failing to maintain equipment, resulting in
pollution (air or water). Community wants to live in
an environmentally friendly area with no danger to
community from pollutants.
Management Customers Reduced quality of goods and services provided
to customers with no reduction in prices being
charged. Customers are looking for quality goods
for a reasonable price (i.e. not being overcharged or
under-serviced).
ACTIVITY 2.1
Changing retail environment in Australia
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operating conditions of retailers has been
substantial. Long-established department stores such as Myer, David Jones and Harris Scarfe,
and their discount equivalents Kmart, Big W and Best & Less, are in a state of uncertainty about
future viability. Added to this uncertainty is the further pressure as online stores, such as Temple &
Webster and Kogan, increasingly gain market share. This is, however, not just an Australian issue
but is happening worldwide.
The following is a list of strategies that these businesses could adopt to ensure their ongoing
profitability:
•
Reduce the number of stores, which are costly to run both in terms of lease payments and
not creating sufficient sales revenue.
•
Concentrate on ensuring that large flagship stores carry stock that is appealing to
customers and create a point of difference from online stores.
•
Be prepared to take one large write-down or readjustment of the business operations to
ensure that the restructure takes place.
•
Ensure that shareholders understand that the write-down is part of the overall business
strategy to increase the profitability of the business.
•
Increase the online presence of the traditional retail stores.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

1 Identify the stakeholders of the major department stores and their discount equivalents.
Describe the nature of the interests that the above stakeholders have with these businesses.
2 Identify the stakeholders of the online stores.
3 Compare the interests of the stakeholders of the major department stores and online stores.
4 Identify and describe any potential conflicts that may occur between the large department
stores and the online stores.
ACTIVITY 2.2
Retail environment in Australia
1 Identify and describe the stakeholders that you believe would have a particular interest in
the operations of the following smaller-sized businesses:
a online clothes designer shop
b online catering company
c florist shop in local strip shopping centre
d local family-run restaurant.
2 Choose two from the four examples of businesses listed in Question 1. For each of these
two business examples, identify two stakeholders and describe the conflicting interests
they would have in each of those businesses. For instance, if the business is a local fruit
shop, the customers would want that shop to be open seven days a week. However, the
owners of that family business would not want to open every day, as they would not be
able to provide fresh produce on a Sunday as the wholesale fruit and vegetable market
would be closed. In addition, it would have a significant impact on their family life if they
opened the shop on Sundays and worked in the shop themselves.
ethics a set of
moral principles

follow
Corporate social responsibility is traditionally broken into four areas: environmental,
philanthropic, ethical and economic responsibility. Both internal and external stakeholders of
a business can be affected by the activities of that business in the way they address these four
areas of corporate social responsibility. A business that acts in a socially responsible manner
and has sustainable business operations creates a series of benefits for the community and
the environment. To be perceived by the community as socially responsible potentially creates
a positive reputation for the business. Additionally, it creates more possibilities for retaining
quality employees (internal stakeholders) by positively affecting their levels of satisfaction,
motivation and loyalty to the business. This aligns with human resource objectives of reducing
levels of staff turnover and improving levels of employee satisfaction.
If the business can communicate its positive socially responsible activities to external
stakeholders (e.g. its customers and the community), attaining objectives such as increasing
levels of consumer satisfaction and trust will be easier, and will result in creating an
improvement in customer loyalty to both the business and its products and services.
Establishing that a business exhibits a high level of corporate social responsibility provides that
business with a point of differentiation from its competitors.

Stakeholders want businesses to recognise the importance of these four areas and incorporate
them into their business objectives. Businesses must be ethical in the types of products
they manufacture and services they provide. The Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Commonwealth) establishes guidelines for businesses relating to disclosure of information
on product performance, composition, contents, design, construction and packaging, and
the form and manner in which this information is included with the goods when sold. Many
businesses take their responsibility to the community and the environment very seriously by

going beyond being legally compliant to becoming signatories to the Australian Packaging
Covenant. The Australian Packaging Covenant Strategic Plan 2017–2022 was created and set
as one of its targets ‘to tangibly reduce landfill’. The plan states that businesses must adopt a
corporate socially responsible approach to achieve this target. Revised targets (2025 Targets)
have now been developed, providing a framework for collective, national action on waste
management, recycling and resource recovery for product packaging. They include:
•
•
•
•
100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging
70 per cent of plastic packaging being recycled or composted
50 per cent of average recycled content included in packaging (revised from 30 per cent in
2020 target)
the phasing out of problematic and unnecessary single-use plastics packaging.
These new targets were developed following extensive industry and government consultation
and align with global packaging initiatives. If achieved, they will be an important step on
Australia’s journey towards a circular economy for packaging.
To help our community overcome this complex issue, businesses of all sizes need to adopt
corporate social responsibility objectives and strategies. One large business wholeheartedly
adopting this approach to help our planet is Woolworths. Adopting the mantra ‘Growing
greener every day’ as part of its CSR strategy to create a healthier planet, Woolworths
has redesigned packaging to use 75 per cent less plastic than previous packaging, and
implemented its REDcycle Program, which, since its inception in 2017, has collected in excess of
900 million pieces of soft plastics (i.e. 3700 tonnes). This soft plastic is being upcycled to make
customer benches and car-park bollards. Woolworths has set a target of having 100 per cent of
its Home Brand packaging being reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2023. Woolworths is
also ensuring that its own brand tissues, toilet paper and kitchen towels are responsibly sourced
and independently certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.
In June 2022, Woolworths announced that it would completely remove plastic shopping bags.
In 2018, free single-use plastic bags were replaced by 15-cent reusable bags, and the 2022
announcement said that these would now be phased out over a 12-month period.

Social responsibility requires a business to be working to improve its positive impact on
society and to reduce any negative impact it may have. Westpac, one of Australia’s largest
banks, believes that it must conduct its business to meet its financial, social and environmental
responsibilities. To do this, it needs to establish a set of values and behaviours that underpin its
everyday activities in how it conducts its dealings with its internal and external stakeholders,
namely its people (employees), customers and the community.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

examples of business management
Corporate culture is an internal factor that management seeks to influence in the hope
of optimising business performance. A positive culture that encourages productivity
improvement, sets high standards of quality in products and services, seeks employee
engagement and motivates everyone to do their best work is crucial to the competitiveness
and success of a business.
corporate culture
system of shared
values and beliefs
of people within a
business
One business leader putting this into practice is Ken Boal, vice-president of Cisco Australia and
New Zealand, proud winner of the 50 Best Places to Work in Australia 2020 (more than 1000
employees category). He believes that Cisco’s improved workplace culture has come about
through increased transparency and trust, and the company’s greater purpose to power an
inclusive future.
Peter Drucker, hailed as the father of modern management, believed that
managers above everything else should be leaders within their businesses and
are duty-bound to ensure that a desired corporate culture is established and
maintained in a business. Stakeholders – and in particular, employees – should
be able to discern the differences between the official culture and the real culture
that exists within a business. Strategies can be used by a business to develop
and implement the desired corporate culture. The internal culture of a business
is in fact its personality and is an important determinant of how effectively and
efficiently a business functions. It is the role of the leadership team to monitor
and put in place strategies to develop and alter the culture of a business.
Corporate culture is often summed up with the phrase ‘it’s how we do things
around here’. It is a system of values and beliefs shared by the people within
a business. It determines how people behave, act towards one another and
what is, or isn’t, accepted behaviour. It reflects the shared view of the direction
and values, priorities and commitments, as well as feelings of loyalty and
personal worth within the business. Culture has both observable and non-
observable elements.
Corporate culture is:
•
•
•
•
a pattern of basic shared assumptions within a business
developed and shared by a group
representative of things that worked well in the past and are considered valid within the
business
taught to newcomers as the ‘correct’ way of thinking, feeling and doing.

Insentra – named as a winner in the 50 Best
Places to Work in Australia 2020 (under 100
employees category)
Ronnie Altit, co-founder and chief executive
of Insentra, an Australian IT provider, states
that ‘culture is at the top of my list as CEO,
it’s the number one thing I focus on’. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, Insentra, which
employs 54 people, was able to retain all of
its employees. Looking after those employees
involved ‘a whole bunch of things’ to keep the
crew motivated and in touch with each other,
such as weekly cooking challenges, an ‘iso fit’
health challenge and virtual trivia. Altit says
he makes a conscious effort to make himself
as accessible as possible to everyone. He had
weekly ‘45 minutes with Ronnie’ team calls,
which provided an opportunity for employees
to ask questions and banter with each other,
and allowed Ronnie to find out more about
his team. It has meant that the casual ‘water
cooler’ chats now occur virtually.

respective categories as among the 50 best workplaces in Australia.
Official and real corporate culture
Businesses are very aware of the importance of developing a positive corporate culture. The
first step to developing and promoting a desired culture is to establish the official corporate
culture. The official or desired culture is, however, not always reflected in existing real
(unofficial) culture.
Official culture
Formal written expression of the values and beliefs
of the business
Who we are and what we say we do
Visible through business or company documents,
goals, mission and official statements. Often slogans
and logos are developed to represent

productivity. Developing a positive corporate culture for a business relies on the strategies or
factors shown in Figure 2.8.

The creation of formal written mission, vision and values statements
Many businesses refer to their corporate culture as ‘organisational culture’, which encompasses
their mission, objectives, expectations and values that guide their employees. Businesses that
adopt an organisational culture tend to be more
successful than less structured businesses because
they have systems in place to promote employee
performance, productivity and engagement.
The mission statement defines the purpose of a
business or its reason for being. It also indicates
the way a business will be managed. The vision
statement formally sets out the business’s
aspirations or what the business is aiming to
achieve. Creating a values statement outlines what
the business wants to recognise as its corporate/
business values – for example, integrity, honesty,
fairness and responsibility. The values identified
in this statement are those that are held to be
important to people within the business. For
instance, if the corporate culture of a business
strongly acknowledges its corporate social
Figure 2.9 The values of an organisation are the foundation of its
responsibility to society and the environment,
corporate culture.
it will be regarded more favourably by its
stakeholders. This approach should help to drive
better financial results. On the other hand, a strong corporate culture that is not in tune with the
environment will hinder a business more than a weak corporate culture. These three documents
act as the starting point for identification and establishment of a desired culture. They provide
the purpose with which all decisions made in the business must align.

Establishing management structures
The way in which the different parts of a business are formally arranged, linking management,
employees and their functions, can help to shape its corporate culture. The structure of a
business determines how work tasks are divided and coordinated. It also indicates who holds
authority and the relationships between different parts of the business.
The features of a management structure are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
division of labour – who does what
segmentation of employees into departments or divisions
chain of command, control and authority – who is responsible to whom and for what
communication channels – downward, upward and lateral
the patterns of decision-making – centralised or decentralised
the number of layers in the management hierarchy.
Traditional businesses have operated under a hierarchical structure that features three distinct
levels of management. Senior/executive management, the top level in the management
hierarchy, is responsible for the strategic or long-term planning of the business. It is required
to work closely with the board of directors (if a company) to establish the mission, vision and
values statements. Middle-level managers are the next level in the hierarchy: each manager
is responsible for one division or department. Front-line managers, often referred to as team
leaders or supervisors, have responsibility for the day-to-day planning and decision-making in
the business. It is the responsibility of all three levels of management to ensure that the official
corporate culture of the business is understood by the workers.
Many businesses have moved away from the traditional hierarchical structure, hoping to
become more dynamic in their operations, be more responsive to changes in the business
environment, and increase levels of productivity and competitiveness. Removing layers
(delayering) of management has meant that some management roles and responsibilities have
been taken over by employee work groups or teams. This change in structure has resulted in
significant workplace changes, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
greater employee involvement in participative decision-making
increased level of employee engagement
decentralisation of power
improved motivation
improved communication flow and transparency
less status distinction (e.g. offices)
a move away from autocratic management styles to adopting consultative
and participative styles

Choice of management styles
Management styles refer to the different ways that managers in a business behave. The
preferred style of a manager will depend on many factors, such as cultural styles of leadership
and the type of business they are managing. For instance, an autocratic style will suit a
highly structured business, where great emphasis is placed on achieving tasks and following
established processes. These managers place little value on the level of job satisfaction
employees gain when contributing to the overall performance of the business. The objectives,
aims and operating environments reflect the ideas, beliefs and values of the manager.
In contrast, a manager who uses the participative style to manage their subordinates places
emphasis on ensuring that workers gain job satisfaction as well as achieving their assigned
work tasks. Greater emphasis is placed on the employees’ contribution to the process of
decision-making, and communication is open.
A business that adopts a management style that is more employee-centred demonstrates that
it values the contribution of its workers and places trust and faith in their abilities. This would
result in creating a more positive corporate culture than an organisation that is totally task-
oriented and adopts an autocratic management style.
policy a written
statement of
processes,
procedures, rules
and regulations
Implementation of policies
A policy is a written statement detailing processes, procedures, rules and regulations that must
be observed in a given situation. In effect, a policy tells employees what to do and how to do it
in a given situation. When establishing and reinforcing the corporate culture of a business, the
policies and practices within a business should reflect the values of that business. Policies are
designed to establish standards of behaviour and guiding principles on actions that should be
taken in a given situation. This assists in developing and reinforcing the corporate culture by:
•
establishing consistency. For instance, suppose a business sets out a ‘social media usage’
policy that establishes the guidelines for the non-usage of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
TikTok and YouTube while at the workplace and during working hours. This means that any
employee caught breaking that rule will be subject to the same sanction.
•
setting out procedures. Procedures are a series of steps that must be followed to implement
the policy. These procedures will guarantee actions that reflect the values and mission of the
business.

identifying how potential conflict situations can be resolved
complying with and accepting desired behaviours within the business.
Official business documentation and forms of communication
The branding of a business is an important factor when developing the official corporate
culture of that business. It represents the way the customers view the business. It is therefore
important when designing business documentation, such as a letterhead or a logo, that it
clearly represents the public image the business wishes to convey. The language used in the
documentation can also indicate whether there is a formal or informal culture. Also, specific
or specialist language, such as jargon and acronyms, can act to bind employees within a
workplace. For instance, schools use educational jargon such as VCAA, VCE, GAT, SAC and ATAR.
People
The culture of a business is reflected in its people.
Employees are an important determinant and indicator
of culture. If a level of formality between management
and employees is required in the workplace, the way
people greet each other can achieve this – for example,
by using courtesy titles such as Mr, Mrs, Dr or Professor
when greeting fellow workers. A less formal culture
would place emphasis on greeting a person (manager
or worker) using their first name.
If a business wants to create a corporate culture
that celebrates diversity in its people, it can use its
recruitment policies to achieve this objective. Diversity
can be created by ensuring that there is a mix of
workers of different genders, with different ethnic
backgrounds and with differing ages, skills and levels of
experience. Diversity acts to enrich the corporate culture.
Figure 2.10 Diversity enriches corporate culture, and it is imperative
that businesses strive to hire people from diverse backgrounds, ages
and skill sets.
Having the ‘right’ people who share the core values of the business or possess a willingness to
embrace those values will assist the business to build a coherent culture. Thought, planning
and effort must be put into attracting, retaining, rewarding and developing people (employees)
with the right cultural fit and attitude.
In our current business environment, it is important that businesses value their workers both
for their contribution to the success of the business and as private individuals. The attitude of
the business to assisting its workers to create work–life balance can be used as an indicator of
whether the culture of that business is positive.

Bunnings: a diverse
workforce
Bunnings is Australia and New Zealand’s
leading retailer of home improvement and
outdoor living products, and a major supplier
to project builders, commercial tradespeople
and the housing industry.
Bunnings engages with the communities in
which it operates, and actively contributes to
causes and organisations that benefit these
communities.
It employs more than 50 000 team members
(June 2022), and has a stated ambition to
provide its customers with the widest range
of home improvement products in accordance
with its lowest prices policy, backed with the
best service.
It seeks to lessen its environmental impact in
ways that are measurable, including achieving
better and more efficient use of resources,
ensuring that its suppliers operate sustainably
and ethically, encouraging and educating
customers about environmentally friendly
alternatives, and focusing on the ‘reduce, reuse
and recycle’ waste management principles.
Bunnings recognises its team members as
being the heart and soul of its business. Its
team’s guiding principles are integrity, respect,
teamwork, achievement and innovation, which
are the keys to its culture and achieving its
vision.

Physical environment and material symbols
Physical environment is a significant indicator of
culture. Open-plan offices, for example, promote lateral
communication, team building and collaboration. The
location of a business also affects its culture. For example, an
inner-city ‘hipster’ location will promote an entirely different
culture from a business located in an outer suburban area.
Similarly, a traditional CBD location will promote a different
culture from a business in a rural location.
Material symbols representing status in an organisation are
another physical indicator. For instance, do senior managers
have bigger offices than middle managers? Are there
separate cafeterias for blue-collar and white-collar workers?
Other physical indicators of culture can include colour and
design of staff uniforms or the colour used in the decoration of the office space.

ACTIVITY 2.7
1 Brainstorm some examples of the observable elements of corporate culture. Then, select a
business you are familiar with and identify the observable elements of its corporate culture.
2 Explain why it is important for a business to maintain an appealing official corporate
culture.
3 Identify potential consequences to a business if its ‘real corporate culture’ is judged as
being ‘toxic’.
Stories, narratives and rituals
The importance of creating stories and narratives about
significant events and/or people in the business, such as its
founders, cannot be overlooked. The people about whom
stories are told often then become ‘heroes’ for that business.
Displaying pictures of these people in the foyer or reception
area will show the pride and esteem in which they are valued.
Establishing and acknowledging rituals that express key
values and expectations within a business should be
encouraged. Examples of these are recognition and reward
ceremonies, weekly social get-togethers, participating in
social club activities or the annual Christmas party. These
rituals help to underscore the importance placed on the
positive benefits gained through social interaction in the
workplace and the celebration of a job well done.
Figure 2.12 Office celebrations strengthen employee relations and
highlight the importance of acknowledging good work.
A positive corporate culture is a vital component for any business in developing and
maintaining its competitive edge. While a business will have developed an official corporate
culture by implementing the strategies outlined in this chapter, observing the real culture will
show what is actually occurring. The COVID-19 pandemic has been among the most stressful
and challenging times that current businesses and employees have experienced. Hard times
reflect character in both individuals and businesses. If a business has survived, and adapted in
the way it serves its customers, employees and stakeholders during this challenging period,
then it is demonstrating a positive culture in action.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

TEST: Can student explain ideas in their own words or recognise examples?
QUESTION TYPES: Explain concepts, interpret meanings, classify examples, summarise relationships.
STEMS: "Which statement best explains...", "What does X mean...", "An example of X would be...", "Why does..."
AVOID: Direct recall of definitions. Require paraphrasing or recognition in new contexts.

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

WHAT (concept explanation):
Businesses contribute to the economy by manufacturing and selling goods or providing services, creating employment, generating taxation revenue for the government, driving innovation and product development, and providing infrastructure.

WHY (importance):
Recognising the broader economic role of businesses helps explain why governments regulate and support them.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A regional manufacturing company creates 50 local jobs, pays company tax to the ATO, and supplies products to both domestic and international customers.

SUBTOPIC: Types of Businesses Overview
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic introduces the Australian mixed market economy and the distinction between the private and public sectors. It covers the six types of business structures and why businesses matter to the economy.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding how different businesses are structured helps explain why owners choose particular legal forms and how those choices affect liability, control and growth potential.

TOPIC: Business foundations
SUBJECT: Business Management | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: An exploration of the types of businesses operating in Australia and the objectives that guide their decision-making and strategic direction.

CHAPTER 2
Stakeholders and corporate
culture
‘I think it is going to be very difficult to be a company in silos. I think
the game has changed. We won’t define our success by looking at the
competitors but at how satisfied are our customers, how engaged are our
internal stakeholders, and how good is our product pipeline.’
Michael Dell (1965–)
About the author:
Michael Dell is the founder, chairman and CEO of Dell
Technologies, one of the world’s largest technology
infrastructure companies.
KICKSTARTER ACTIVITY
Work with a partner. Read the quotation about business stakeholders
and discuss your response to the following questions:
1 What does the concept of ‘silos’ mean when referring to businesses?
2 What approach does Michael Dell put forward as the key to success of the
modern business?
CHAPTER OVERVIEW
This chapter examines the key characteristics of the stakeholders of
a business. Regardless of the size of the business, some stakeholders
may influence the business in a positive way while others may
experience conflict with the business. Both groups of stakeholders,
however, have an effect on the success of the business. Corporate
culture, whether official or real, is also examined. It is important for a
business to have a positive corporate culture and to have strategies in
place to develop the culture of that business.

At each level of the business
environment (macro, operating
and internal), there are
stakeholders or pressures
that impact directly on the
business. A stakeholder can
either affect or be affected by
the operations of a business.
Ideally, all stakeholders should
want the business to achieve
its aims or objectives. In reality,
this does not occur, as various
stakeholders (e.g. a competitor)
would have conflicting interests.
In addition, the needs of
stakeholders can actually be
at variance with each other.
Lobby groups interested in the
environment may have interests
that differ from the interests
of those who believe the only
purpose of a business is to make
a sizeable profit. Success comes
from working out strategies
to overcome or satisfy these
varying interests.
Figure 2.1 Stakeholders can have a significant effect on the success of a
business.
The major stakeholders of a business, together with their most likely interests and issues, are
identified in Table 2.1. These stakeholders are generally drawn from the internal and operating
environment of the business.

Stakeholder Stakeholder Potential areas of conflict
Business owners/
directors
Shareholders The amount of profit to be distributed at the end
of the year. The shareholders want to receive a
substantial dividend. Owners/directors want to
distribute a smaller portion of the profit, retaining
an amount for building the business.
Management Suppliers Suppliers want to be ensured a guaranteed supplier
relationship where the price paid is fair and is paid
promptly. Management wants to ensure that the
quality of the goods being supplied is consistent,
supplied on time and of high standard, but at the
lowest cost possible.
Business owners Community Business operations may cause environmental
issues due to the business owners not installing
or failing to maintain equipment, resulting in
pollution (air or water). Community wants to live in
an environmentally friendly area with no danger to
community from pollutants.
Management Customers Reduced quality of goods and services provided
to customers with no reduction in prices being
charged. Customers are looking for quality goods
for a reasonable price (i.e. not being overcharged or
under-serviced).
ACTIVITY 2.1
Changing retail environment in Australia
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operating conditions of retailers has been
substantial. Long-established department stores such as Myer, David Jones and Harris Scarfe,
and their discount equivalents Kmart, Big W and Best & Less, are in a state of uncertainty about
future viability. Added to this uncertainty is the further pressure as online stores, such as Temple &
Webster and Kogan, increasingly gain market share. This is, however, not just an Australian issue
but is happening worldwide.
The following is a list of strategies that these businesses could adopt to ensure their ongoing
profitability:
•
Reduce the number of stores, which are costly to run both in terms of lease payments and
not creating sufficient sales revenue.
•
Concentrate on ensuring that large flagship stores carry stock that is appealing to
customers and create a point of difference from online stores.
•
Be prepared to take one large write-down or readjustment of the business operations to
ensure that the restructure takes place.
•
Ensure that shareholders understand that the write-down is part of the overall business
strategy to increase the profitability of the business.
•
Increase the online presence of the traditional retail stores.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

1 Identify the stakeholders of the major department stores and their discount equivalents.
Describe the nature of the interests that the above stakeholders have with these businesses.
2 Identify the stakeholders of the online stores.
3 Compare the interests of the stakeholders of the major department stores and online stores.
4 Identify and describe any potential conflicts that may occur between the large department
stores and the online stores.
ACTIVITY 2.2
Retail environment in Australia
1 Identify and describe the stakeholders that you believe would have a particular interest in
the operations of the following smaller-sized businesses:
a online clothes designer shop
b online catering company
c florist shop in local strip shopping centre
d local family-run restaurant.
2 Choose two from the four examples of businesses listed in Question 1. For each of these
two business examples, identify two stakeholders and describe the conflicting interests
they would have in each of those businesses. For instance, if the business is a local fruit
shop, the customers would want that shop to be open seven days a week. However, the
owners of that family business would not want to open every day, as they would not be
able to provide fresh produce on a Sunday as the wholesale fruit and vegetable market
would be closed. In addition, it would have a significant impact on their family life if they
opened the shop on Sundays and worked in the shop themselves.
ethics a set of
moral principles

needs to
establish and
follow
Corporate social responsibility is traditionally broken into four areas: environmental,
philanthropic, ethical and economic responsibility. Both internal and external stakeholders of
a business can be affected by the activities of that business in the way they address these four
areas of corporate social responsibility. A business that acts in a socially responsible manner
and has sustainable business operations creates a series of benefits for the community and
the environment. To be perceived by the community as socially responsible potentially creates
a positive reputation for the business. Additionally, it creates more possibilities for retaining
quality employees (internal stakeholders) by positively affecting their levels of satisfaction,
motivation and loyalty to the business. This aligns with human resource objectives of reducing
levels of staff turnover and improving levels of employee satisfaction.
If the business can communicate its positive socially responsible activities to external
stakeholders (e.g. its customers and the community), attaining objectives such as increasing
levels of consumer satisfaction and trust will be easier, and will result in creating an
improvement in customer loyalty to both the business and its products and services.
Establishing that a business exhibits a high level of corporate social responsibility provides that
business with a point of differentiation from its competitors.

Stakeholders want businesses to recognise the importance of these four areas and incorporate
them into their business objectives. Businesses must be ethical in the types of products
they manufacture and services they provide. The Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Commonwealth) establishes guidelines for businesses relating to disclosure of information
on product performance, composition, contents, design, construction and packaging, and
the form and manner in which this information is included with the goods when sold. Many
businesses take their responsibility to the community and the environment very seriously by

going beyond being legally compliant to becoming signatories to the Australian Packaging
Covenant. The Australian Packaging Covenant Strategic Plan 2017–2022 was created and set
as one of its targets ‘to tangibly reduce landfill’. The plan states that businesses must adopt a
corporate socially responsible approach to achieve this target. Revised targets (2025 Targets)
have now been developed, providing a framework for collective, national action on waste
management, recycling and resource recovery for product packaging. They include:
•
•
•
•
100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging
70 per cent of plastic packaging being recycled or composted
50 per cent of average recycled content included in packaging (revised from 30 per cent in
2020 target)
the phasing out of problematic and unnecessary single-use plastics packaging.
These new targets were developed following extensive industry and government consultation
and align with global packaging initiatives. If achieved, they will be an important step on
Australia’s journey towards a circular economy for packaging.
To help our community overcome this complex issue, businesses of all sizes need to adopt
corporate social responsibility objectives and strategies. One large business wholeheartedly
adopting this approach to help our planet is Woolworths. Adopting the mantra ‘Growing
greener every day’ as part of its CSR strategy to create a healthier planet, Woolworths
has redesigned packaging to use 75 per cent less plastic than previous packaging, and
implemented its REDcycle Program, which, since its inception in 2017, has collected in excess of
900 million pieces of soft plastics (i.e. 3700 tonnes). This soft plastic is being upcycled to make
customer benches and car-park bollards. Woolworths has set a target of having 100 per cent of
its Home Brand packaging being reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2023. Woolworths is
also ensuring that its own brand tissues, toilet paper and kitchen towels are responsibly sourced
and independently certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.
In June 2022, Woolworths announced that it would completely remove plastic shopping bags.
In 2018, free single-use plastic bags were replaced by 15-cent reusable bags, and the 2022
announcement said that these would now be phased out over a 12-month period.

Social responsibility requires a business to be working to improve its positive impact on
society and to reduce any negative impact it may have. Westpac, one of Australia’s largest
banks, believes that it must conduct its business to meet its financial, social and environmental
responsibilities. To do this, it needs to establish a set of values and behaviours that underpin its
everyday activities in how it conducts its dealings with its internal and external stakeholders,
namely its people (employees), customers and the community.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

One business leader putting this into practice is Ken Boal, vice-president of Cisco Australia and
New Zealand, proud winner of the 50 Best Places to Work in Australia 2020 (more than 1000
employees category). He believes that Cisco’s improved workplace culture has come about
through increased transparency and trust, and the company’s greater purpose to power an
inclusive future.
Peter Drucker, hailed as the father of modern management, believed that
managers above everything else should be leaders within their businesses and
are duty-bound to ensure that a desired corporate culture is established and
maintained in a business. Stakeholders – and in particular, employees – should
be able to discern the differences between the official culture and the real culture
that exists within a business. Strategies can be used by a business to develop
and implement the desired corporate culture. The internal culture of a business
is in fact its personality and is an important determinant of how effectively and
efficiently a business functions. It is the role of the leadership team to monitor
and put in place strategies to develop and alter the culture of a business.
Corporate culture is often summed up with the phrase ‘it’s how we do things
around here’. It is a system of values and beliefs shared by the people within
a business. It determines how people behave, act towards one another and
what is, or isn’t, accepted behaviour. It reflects the shared view of the direction
and values, priorities and commitments, as well as feelings of loyalty and
personal worth within the business. Culture has both observable and non-
observable elements.
Corporate culture is:
•
•
•
•
a pattern of basic shared assumptions within a business
developed and shared by a group
representative of things that worked well in the past and are considered valid within the
business
taught to newcomers as the ‘correct’ way of thinking, feeling and doing.

Ronnie Altit, co-founder and chief executive
of Insentra, an Australian IT provider, states
that ‘culture is at the top of my list as CEO,
it’s the number one thing I focus on’. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, Insentra, which
employs 54 people, was able to retain all of
its employees. Looking after those employees
involved ‘a whole bunch of things’ to keep the
crew motivated and in touch with each other,
such as weekly cooking challenges, an ‘iso fit’
health challenge and virtual trivia. Altit says
he makes a conscious effort to make himself
as accessible as possible to everyone. He had
weekly ‘45 minutes with Ronnie’ team calls,
which provided an opportunity for employees
to ask questions and banter with each other,
and allowed Ronnie to find out more about
his team. It has meant that the casual ‘water
cooler’ chats now occur virtually.

Official and real corporate culture
Businesses are very aware of the importance of developing a positive corporate culture. The
first step to developing and promoting a desired culture is to establish the official corporate
culture. The official or desired culture is, however, not always reflected in existing real
(unofficial) culture.

The creation of formal written mission, vision and values statements
Many businesses refer to their corporate culture as ‘organisational culture’, which encompasses
their mission, objectives, expectations and values that guide their employees. Businesses that
adopt an organisational culture tend to be more
successful than less structured businesses because
they have systems in place to promote employee
performance, productivity and engagement.
The mission statement defines the purpose of a
business or its reason for being. It also indicates
the way a business will be managed. The vision
statement formally sets out the business’s
aspirations or what the business is aiming to
achieve. Creating a values statement outlines what
the business wants to recognise as its corporate/
business values – for example, integrity, honesty,
fairness and responsibility. The values identified
in this statement are those that are held to be
important to people within the business. For
instance, if the corporate culture of a business
strongly acknowledges its corporate social
Figure 2.9 The values of an organisation are the foundation of its
responsibility to society and the environment,
corporate culture.
it will be regarded more favourably by its
stakeholders. This approach should help to drive
better financial results. On the other hand, a strong corporate culture that is not in tune with the
environment will hinder a business more than a weak corporate culture. These three documents
act as the starting point for identification and establishment of a desired culture. They provide
the purpose with which all decisions made in the business must align.

Establishing management structures
The way in which the different parts of a business are formally arranged, linking management,
employees and their functions, can help to shape its corporate culture. The structure of a
business determines how work tasks are divided and coordinated. It also indicates who holds
authority and the relationships between different parts of the business.
The features of a management structure are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
division of labour – who does what
segmentation of employees into departments or divisions
chain of command, control and authority – who is responsible to whom and for what
communication channels – downward, upward and lateral
the patterns of decision-making – centralised or decentralised
the number of layers in the management hierarchy.
Traditional businesses have operated under a hierarchical structure that features three distinct
levels of management. Senior/executive management, the top level in the management
hierarchy, is responsible for the strategic or long-term planning of the business. It is required
to work closely with the board of directors (if a company) to establish the mission, vision and
values statements. Middle-level managers are the next level in the hierarchy: each manager
is responsible for one division or department. Front-line managers, often referred to as team
leaders or supervisors, have responsibility for the day-to-day planning and decision-making in
the business. It is the responsibility of all three levels of management to ensure that the official
corporate culture of the business is understood by the workers.
Many businesses have moved away from the traditional hierarchical structure, hoping to
become more dynamic in their operations, be more responsive to changes in the business
environment, and increase levels of productivity and competitiveness. Removing layers
(delayering) of management has meant that some management roles and responsibilities have
been taken over by employee work groups or teams. This change in structure has resulted in
significant workplace changes, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
greater employee involvement in participative decision-making
increased level of employee engagement
decentralisation of power
improved motivation
improved communication flow and transparency
less status distinction (e.g. offices)
a move away from autocratic management styles to adopting consultative
and participative styles

Choice of management styles
Management styles refer to the different ways that managers in a business behave. The
preferred style of a manager will depend on many factors, such as cultural styles of leadership
and the type of business they are managing. For instance, an autocratic style will suit a
highly structured business, where great emphasis is placed on achieving tasks and following
established processes. These managers place little value on the level of job satisfaction
employees gain when contributing to the overall performance of the business. The objectives,
aims and operating environments reflect the ideas, beliefs and values of the manager.
In contrast, a manager who uses the participative style to manage their subordinates places
emphasis on ensuring that workers gain job satisfaction as well as achieving their assigned
work tasks. Greater emphasis is placed on the employees’ contribution to the process of
decision-making, and communication is open.
A business that adopts a management style that is more employee-centred demonstrates that
it values the contribution of its workers and places trust and faith in their abilities. This would
result in creating a more positive corporate culture than an organisation that is totally task-
oriented and adopts an autocratic management style.
policy a written
statement of
processes,
procedures, rules
and regulations
Implementation of policies
A policy is a written statement detailing processes, procedures, rules and regulations that must
be observed in a given situation. In effect, a policy tells employees what to do and how to do it
in a given situation. When establishing and reinforcing the corporate culture of a business, the
policies and practices within a business should reflect the values of that business. Policies are
designed to establish standards of behaviour and guiding principles on actions that should be
taken in a given situation. This assists in developing and reinforcing the corporate culture by:
•
establishing consistency. For instance, suppose a business sets out a ‘social media usage’
policy that establishes the guidelines for the non-usage of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
TikTok and YouTube while at the workplace and during working hours. This means that any
employee caught breaking that rule will be subject to the same sanction.
•
setting out procedures. Procedures are a series of steps that must be followed to implement
the policy. These procedures will guarantee actions that reflect the values and mission of the
business.

recognising the rights and obligations of people within the business
identifying how potential conflict situations can be resolved
complying with and accepting desired behaviours within the business.
Official business documentation and forms of communication
The branding of a business is an important factor when developing the official corporate
culture of that business. It represents the way the customers view the business. It is therefore
important when designing business documentation, such as a letterhead or a logo, that it
clearly represents the public image the business wishes to convey. The language used in the
documentation can also indicate whether there is a formal or informal culture. Also, specific
or specialist language, such as jargon and acronyms, can act to bind employees within a
workplace. For instance, schools use educational jargon such as VCAA, VCE, GAT, SAC and ATAR.
People
The culture of a business is reflected in its people.
Employees are an important determinant and indicator
of culture. If a level of formality between management
and employees is required in the workplace, the way
people greet each other can achieve this – for example,
by using courtesy titles such as Mr, Mrs, Dr or Professor
when greeting fellow workers. A less formal culture
would place emphasis on greeting a person (manager
or worker) using their first name.
If a business wants to create a corporate culture
that celebrates diversity in its people, it can use its
recruitment policies to achieve this objective. Diversity
can be created by ensuring that there is a mix of
workers of different genders, with different ethnic
backgrounds and with differing ages, skills and levels of
experience. Diversity acts to enrich the corporate culture.
Figure 2.10 Diversity enriches corporate culture, and it is imperative
that businesses strive to hire people from diverse backgrounds, ages
and skill sets.
Having the ‘right’ people who share the core values of the business or possess a willingness to
embrace those values will assist the business to build a coherent culture. Thought, planning
and effort must be put into attracting, retaining, rewarding and developing people (employees)
with the right cultural fit and attitude.
In our current business environment, it is important that businesses value their workers both
for their contribution to the success of the business and as private individuals. The attitude of
the business to assisting its workers to create work–life balance can be used as an indicator of
whether the culture of that business is positive.

Bunnings: a diverse
workforce
Bunnings is Australia and New Zealand’s
leading retailer of home improvement and
outdoor living products, and a major supplier
to project builders, commercial tradespeople
and the housing industry.
Bunnings engages with the communities in
which it operates, and actively contributes to
causes and organisations that benefit these
communities.
It employs more than 50 000 team members
(June 2022), and has a stated ambition to
provide its customers with the widest range
of home improvement products in accordance
with its lowest prices policy, backed with the

Physical environment and material symbols
Physical environment is a significant indicator of
culture. Open-plan offices, for example, promote lateral
communication, team building and collaboration. The
location of a business also affects its culture. For example, an
inner-city ‘hipster’ location will promote an entirely different
culture from a business located in an outer suburban area.
Similarly, a traditional CBD location will promote a different
culture from a business in a rural location.
Material symbols representing status in an organisation are
another physical indicator. For instance, do senior managers
have bigger offices than middle managers? Are there
separate cafeterias for blue-collar and white-collar workers?
Other physical indicators of culture can include colour and
design of staff uniforms or the colour used in the decoration of the office space.

ACTIVITY 2.7
1 Brainstorm some examples of the observable elements of corporate culture. Then, select a
business you are familiar with and identify the observable elements of its corporate culture.
2 Explain why it is important for a business to maintain an appealing official corporate
culture.
3 Identify potential consequences to a business if its ‘real corporate culture’ is judged as
being ‘toxic’.
Stories, narratives and rituals
The importance of creating stories and narratives about
significant events and/or people in the business, such as its
founders, cannot be overlooked. The people about whom
stories are told often then become ‘heroes’ for that business.
Displaying pictures of these people in the foyer or reception
area will show the pride and esteem in which they are valued.
Establishing and acknowledging rituals that express key
values and expectations within a business should be
encouraged. Examples of these are recognition and reward
ceremonies, weekly social get-togethers, participating in
social club activities or the annual Christmas party. These
rituals help to underscore the importance placed on the
positive benefits gained through social interaction in the
workplace and the celebration of a job well done.
Figure 2.12 Office celebrations strengthen employee relations and
highlight the importance of acknowledging good work.
A positive corporate culture is a vital component for any business in developing and
maintaining its competitive edge. While a business will have developed an official corporate
culture by implementing the strategies outlined in this chapter, observing the real culture will
show what is actually occurring. The COVID-19 pandemic has been among the most stressful
and challenging times that current businesses and employees have experienced. Hard times
reflect character in both individuals and businesses. If a business has survived, and adapted in
the way it serves its customers, employees and stakeholders during this challenging period,
then it is demonstrating a positive culture in action.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

CHAPTER 2
Stakeholders and corporate
culture
‘I think it is going to be very difficult to be a company in silos. I think
the game has changed. We won’t define our success by looking at the
competitors but at how satisfied are our customers, how engaged are our
internal stakeholders, and how good is our product pipeline.’
Michael Dell (1965–)
About the author:
Michael Dell is the founder, chairman and CEO of Dell
Technologies, one of the world’s largest technology
infrastructure companies.
KICKSTARTER ACTIVITY
Work with a partner. Read the quotation about business stakeholders
and discuss your response to the following questions:
1 What does the concept of ‘silos’ mean when referring to businesses?
2 What approach does Michael Dell put forward as the key to success of the
modern business?
CHAPTER OVERVIEW
This chapter examines the key characteristics of the stakeholders of
a business. Regardless of the size of the business, some stakeholders
may influence the business in a positive way while others may
experience conflict with the business. Both groups of stakeholders,
however, have an effect on the success of the business. Corporate
culture, whether official or real, is also examined. It is important for a
business to have a positive corporate culture and to have strategies in
place to develop the culture of that business.

At each level of the business
environment (macro, operating
and internal), there are
stakeholders or pressures
that impact directly on the
business. A stakeholder can
either affect or be affected by
the operations of a business.
Ideally, all stakeholders should
want the business to achieve
its aims or objectives. In reality,
this does not occur, as various
stakeholders (e.g. a competitor)
would have conflicting interests.
In addition, the needs of
stakeholders can actually be
at variance with each other.
Lobby groups interested in the
environment may have interests
that differ from the interests
of those who believe the only
purpose of a business is to make
a sizeable profit. Success comes
from working out strategies
to overcome or satisfy these
varying interests.
Figure 2.1 Stakeholders can have a significant effect on the success of a
business.
The major stakeholders of a business, together with their most likely interests and issues, are
identified in Table 2.1. These stakeholders are generally drawn from the internal and operating
environment of the business.

Business owners/

Shareholders The amount of profit to be distributed at the end
of the year. The shareholders want to receive a
substantial dividend. Owners/directors want to
distribute a smaller portion of the profit, retaining
an amount for building the business.
Management Suppliers Suppliers want to be ensured a guaranteed supplier
relationship where the price paid is fair and is paid
promptly. Management wants to ensure that the
quality of the goods being supplied is consistent,
supplied on time and of high standard, but at the
lowest cost possible.
Business owners Community Business operations may cause environmental
issues due to the business owners not installing
or failing to maintain equipment, resulting in
pollution (air or water). Community wants to live in
an environmentally friendly area with no danger to
community from pollutants.
Management Customers Reduced quality of goods and services provided
to customers with no reduction in prices being
charged. Customers are looking for quality goods
for a reasonable price (i.e. not being overcharged or
under-serviced).
ACTIVITY 2.1
Changing retail environment in Australia
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operating conditions of retailers has been
substantial. Long-established department stores such as Myer, David Jones and Harris Scarfe,
and their discount equivalents Kmart, Big W and Best & Less, are in a state of uncertainty about
future viability. Added to this uncertainty is the further pressure as online stores, such as Temple &
Webster and Kogan, increasingly gain market share. This is, however, not just an Australian issue
but is happening worldwide.
The following is a list of strategies that these businesses could adopt to ensure their ongoing
profitability:
•
Reduce the number of stores, which are costly to run both in terms of lease payments and
not creating sufficient sales revenue.
•
Concentrate on ensuring that large flagship stores carry stock that is appealing to
customers and create a point of difference from online stores.
•
Be prepared to take one large write-down or readjustment of the business operations to
ensure that the restructure takes place.
•
Ensure that shareholders understand that the write-down is part of the overall business
strategy to increase the profitability of the business.
•
Increase the online presence of the traditional retail stores.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

1 Identify the stakeholders of the major department stores and their discount equivalents.
Describe the nature of the interests that the above stakeholders have with these businesses.
2 Identify the stakeholders of the online stores.
3 Compare the interests of the stakeholders of the major department stores and online stores.
4 Identify and describe any potential conflicts that may occur between the large department
stores and the online stores.
ACTIVITY 2.2
Retail environment in Australia
1 Identify and describe the stakeholders that you believe would have a particular interest in
the operations of the following smaller-sized businesses:
a online clothes designer shop
b online catering company
c florist shop in local strip shopping centre
d local family-run restaurant.
2 Choose two from the four examples of businesses listed in Question 1. For each of these
two business examples, identify two stakeholders and describe the conflicting interests
they would have in each of those businesses. For instance, if the business is a local fruit
shop, the customers would want that shop to be open seven days a week. However, the
owners of that family business would not want to open every day, as they would not be
able to provide fresh produce on a Sunday as the wholesale fruit and vegetable market
would be closed. In addition, it would have a significant impact on their family life if they
opened the shop on Sundays and worked in the shop themselves.
ethics a set of
moral principles

establish and
follow
Corporate social responsibility is traditionally broken into four areas: environmental,
philanthropic, ethical and economic responsibility. Both internal and external stakeholders of
a business can be affected by the activities of that business in the way they address these four
areas of corporate social responsibility. A business that acts in a socially responsible manner
and has sustainable business operations creates a series of benefits for the community and
the environment. To be perceived by the community as socially responsible potentially creates
a positive reputation for the business. Additionally, it creates more possibilities for retaining
quality employees (internal stakeholders) by positively affecting their levels of satisfaction,
motivation and loyalty to the business. This aligns with human resource objectives of reducing
levels of staff turnover and improving levels of employee satisfaction.
If the business can communicate its positive socially responsible activities to external
stakeholders (e.g. its customers and the community), attaining objectives such as increasing
levels of consumer satisfaction and trust will be easier, and will result in creating an
improvement in customer loyalty to both the business and its products and services.
Establishing that a business exhibits a high level of corporate social responsibility provides that
business with a point of differentiation from its competitors.

Stakeholders want businesses to recognise the importance of these four areas and incorporate
them into their business objectives. Businesses must be ethical in the types of products
they manufacture and services they provide. The Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Commonwealth) establishes guidelines for businesses relating to disclosure of information
on product performance, composition, contents, design, construction and packaging, and
the form and manner in which this information is included with the goods when sold. Many
businesses take their responsibility to the community and the environment very seriously by

going beyond being legally compliant to becoming signatories to the Australian Packaging
Covenant. The Australian Packaging Covenant Strategic Plan 2017–2022 was created and set
as one of its targets ‘to tangibly reduce landfill’. The plan states that businesses must adopt a
corporate socially responsible approach to achieve this target. Revised targets (2025 Targets)
have now been developed, providing a framework for collective, national action on waste
management, recycling and resource recovery for product packaging. They include:
•
•
•
•
100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging
70 per cent of plastic packaging being recycled or composted
50 per cent of average recycled content included in packaging (revised from 30 per cent in
2020 target)
the phasing out of problematic and unnecessary single-use plastics packaging.
These new targets were developed following extensive industry and government consultation
and align with global packaging initiatives. If achieved, they will be an important step on
Australia’s journey towards a circular economy for packaging.
To help our community overcome this complex issue, businesses of all sizes need to adopt
corporate social responsibility objectives and strategies. One large business wholeheartedly
adopting this approach to help our planet is Woolworths. Adopting the mantra ‘Growing
greener every day’ as part of its CSR strategy to create a healthier planet, Woolworths
has redesigned packaging to use 75 per cent less plastic than previous packaging, and
implemented its REDcycle Program, which, since its inception in 2017, has collected in excess of
900 million pieces of soft plastics (i.e. 3700 tonnes). This soft plastic is being upcycled to make
customer benches and car-park bollards. Woolworths has set a target of having 100 per cent of
its Home Brand packaging being reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2023. Woolworths is
also ensuring that its own brand tissues, toilet paper and kitchen towels are responsibly sourced
and independently certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.
In June 2022, Woolworths announced that it would completely remove plastic shopping bags.
In 2018, free single-use plastic bags were replaced by 15-cent reusable bags, and the 2022
announcement said that these would now be phased out over a 12-month period.
ACTIVITY 2.3
1 Identify and describe the CSR strategies adopted by Woolworths to assist in creating a
healthier planet.
2 Visit the Woolworths Group
website and look at the ‘Corporate
Responsibility Strategy’ page.
Choose one stakeholder group
(customers, team members,
suppliers or communities) and
describe the actions that the
business is taking to implement
this strategy for that group. For

Social responsibility requires a business to be working to improve its positive impact on
society and to reduce any negative impact it may have. Westpac, one of Australia’s largest
banks, believes that it must conduct its business to meet its financial, social and environmental
responsibilities. To do this, it needs to establish a set of values and behaviours that underpin its
everyday activities in how it conducts its dealings with its internal and external stakeholders,
namely its people (employees), customers and the community.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

knowledge to case studies and contemporary
examples of business management
Corporate culture is an internal factor that management seeks to influence in the hope
of optimising business performance. A positive culture that encourages productivity
improvement, sets high standards of quality in products and services, seeks employee
engagement and motivates everyone to do their best work is crucial to the competitiveness
and success of a business.

business
One business leader putting this into practice is Ken Boal, vice-president of Cisco Australia and
New Zealand, proud winner of the 50 Best Places to Work in Australia 2020 (more than 1000
employees category). He believes that Cisco’s improved workplace culture has come about
through increased transparency and trust, and the company’s greater purpose to power an
inclusive future.
Peter Drucker, hailed as the father of modern management, believed that
managers above everything else should be leaders within their businesses and
are duty-bound to ensure that a desired corporate culture is established and
maintained in a business. Stakeholders – and in particular, employees – should
be able to discern the differences between the official culture and the real culture
that exists within a business. Strategies can be used by a business to develop
and implement the desired corporate culture. The internal culture of a business
is in fact its personality and is an important determinant of how effectively and
efficiently a business functions. It is the role of the leadership team to monitor
and put in place strategies to develop and alter the culture of a business.
Corporate culture is often summed up with the phrase ‘it’s how we do things
around here’. It is a system of values and beliefs shared by the people within
a business. It determines how people behave, act towards one another and
what is, or isn’t, accepted behaviour. It reflects the shared view of the direction
and values, priorities and commitments, as well as feelings of loyalty and
personal worth within the business. Culture has both observable and non-
observable elements.
Corporate culture is:
•
•
•
•
a pattern of basic shared assumptions within a business
developed and shared by a group
representative of things that worked well in the past and are considered valid within the
business
taught to newcomers as the ‘correct’ way of thinking, feeling and doing.

Ronnie Altit, co-founder and chief executive
of Insentra, an Australian IT provider, states
that ‘culture is at the top of my list as CEO,
it’s the number one thing I focus on’. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, Insentra, which
employs 54 people, was able to retain all of
its employees. Looking after those employees
involved ‘a whole bunch of things’ to keep the
crew motivated and in touch with each other,
such as weekly cooking challenges, an ‘iso fit’
health challenge and virtual trivia. Altit says
he makes a conscious effort to make himself
as accessible as possible to everyone. He had
weekly ‘45 minutes with Ronnie’ team calls,
which provided an opportunity for employees
to ask questions and banter with each other,
and allowed Ronnie to find out more about
his team. It has meant that the casual ‘water
cooler’ chats now occur virtually.

Official and real corporate culture
Businesses are very aware of the importance of developing a positive corporate culture. The
first step to developing and promoting a desired culture is to establish the official corporate
culture. The official or desired culture is, however, not always reflected in existing real
(unofficial) culture.
Official culture

of the business

The creation of formal written mission, vision and values statements
Many businesses refer to their corporate culture as ‘organisational culture’, which encompasses
their mission, objectives, expectations and values that guide their employees. Businesses that
adopt an organisational culture tend to be more
successful than less structured businesses because
they have systems in place to promote employee
performance, productivity and engagement.
The mission statement defines the purpose of a
business or its reason for being. It also indicates
the way a business will be managed. The vision
statement formally sets out the business’s
aspirations or what the business is aiming to
achieve. Creating a values statement outlines what
the business wants to recognise as its corporate/
business values – for example, integrity, honesty,
fairness and responsibility. The values identified
in this statement are those that are held to be
important to people within the business. For
instance, if the corporate culture of a business
strongly acknowledges its corporate social

responsibility to society and the environment,

it will be regarded more favourably by its
stakeholders. This approach should help to drive
better financial results. On the other hand, a strong corporate culture that is not in tune with the
environment will hinder a business more than a weak corporate culture. These three documents
act as the starting point for identification and establishment of a desired culture. They provide
the purpose with which all decisions made in the business must align.

Establishing management structures
The way in which the different parts of a business are formally arranged, linking management,
employees and their functions, can help to shape its corporate culture. The structure of a
business determines how work tasks are divided and coordinated. It also indicates who holds
authority and the relationships between different parts of the business.
The features of a management structure are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
division of labour – who does what
segmentation of employees into departments or divisions
chain of command, control and authority – who is responsible to whom and for what
communication channels – downward, upward and lateral
the patterns of decision-making – centralised or decentralised
the number of layers in the management hierarchy.
Traditional businesses have operated under a hierarchical structure that features three distinct
levels of management. Senior/executive management, the top level in the management
hierarchy, is responsible for the strategic or long-term planning of the business. It is required
to work closely with the board of directors (if a company) to establish the mission, vision and
values statements. Middle-level managers are the next level in the hierarchy: each manager
is responsible for one division or department. Front-line managers, often referred to as team
leaders or supervisors, have responsibility for the day-to-day planning and decision-making in
the business. It is the responsibility of all three levels of management to ensure that the official
corporate culture of the business is understood by the workers.
Many businesses have moved away from the traditional hierarchical structure, hoping to
become more dynamic in their operations, be more responsive to changes in the business
environment, and increase levels of productivity and competitiveness. Removing layers
(delayering) of management has meant that some management roles and responsibilities have
been taken over by employee work groups or teams. This change in structure has resulted in
significant workplace changes, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
greater employee involvement in participative decision-making
increased level of employee engagement
decentralisation of power
improved motivation
improved communication flow and transparency
less status distinction (e.g. offices)
a move away from autocratic management styles to adopting consultative
and participative styles

Choice of management styles
Management styles refer to the different ways that managers in a business behave. The
preferred style of a manager will depend on many factors, such as cultural styles of leadership
and the type of business they are managing. For instance, an autocratic style will suit a
highly structured business, where great emphasis is placed on achieving tasks and following
established processes. These managers place little value on the level of job satisfaction
employees gain when contributing to the overall performance of the business. The objectives,
aims and operating environments reflect the ideas, beliefs and values of the manager.
In contrast, a manager who uses the participative style to manage their subordinates places
emphasis on ensuring that workers gain job satisfaction as well as achieving their assigned
work tasks. Greater emphasis is placed on the employees’ contribution to the process of
decision-making, and communication is open.
A business that adopts a management style that is more employee-centred demonstrates that
it values the contribution of its workers and places trust and faith in their abilities. This would
result in creating a more positive corporate culture than an organisation that is totally task-
oriented and adopts an autocratic management style.
policy a written

and regulations
Implementation of policies
A policy is a written statement detailing processes, procedures, rules and regulations that must
be observed in a given situation. In effect, a policy tells employees what to do and how to do it
in a given situation. When establishing and reinforcing the corporate culture of a business, the
policies and practices within a business should reflect the values of that business. Policies are
designed to establish standards of behaviour and guiding principles on actions that should be
taken in a given situation. This assists in developing and reinforcing the corporate culture by:
•
establishing consistency. For instance, suppose a business sets out a ‘social media usage’
policy that establishes the guidelines for the non-usage of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
TikTok and YouTube while at the workplace and during working hours. This means that any
employee caught breaking that rule will be subject to the same sanction.
•
setting out procedures. Procedures are a series of steps that must be followed to implement
the policy. These procedures will guarantee actions that reflect the values and mission of the
business.

recognising the rights and obligations of people within the business
identifying how potential conflict situations can be resolved
complying with and accepting desired behaviours within the business.
Official business documentation and forms of communication
The branding of a business is an important factor when developing the official corporate
culture of that business. It represents the way the customers view the business. It is therefore
important when designing business documentation, such as a letterhead or a logo, that it
clearly represents the public image the business wishes to convey. The language used in the
documentation can also indicate whether there is a formal or informal culture. Also, specific
or specialist language, such as jargon and acronyms, can act to bind employees within a
workplace. For instance, schools use educational jargon such as VCAA, VCE, GAT, SAC and ATAR.
People
The culture of a business is reflected in its people.
Employees are an important determinant and indicator
of culture. If a level of formality between management
and employees is required in the workplace, the way
people greet each other can achieve this – for example,
by using courtesy titles such as Mr, Mrs, Dr or Professor
when greeting fellow workers. A less formal culture
would place emphasis on greeting a person (manager
or worker) using their first name.
If a business wants to create a corporate culture
that celebrates diversity in its people, it can use its
recruitment policies to achieve this objective. Diversity
can be created by ensuring that there is a mix of
workers of different genders, with different ethnic
backgrounds and with differing ages, skills and levels of
experience. Diversity acts to enrich the corporate culture.
Figure 2.10 Diversity enriches corporate culture, and it is imperative
that businesses strive to hire people from diverse backgrounds, ages
and skill sets.
Having the ‘right’ people who share the core values of the business or possess a willingness to
embrace those values will assist the business to build a coherent culture. Thought, planning
and effort must be put into attracting, retaining, rewarding and developing people (employees)
with the right cultural fit and attitude.
In our current business environment, it is important that businesses value their workers both
for their contribution to the success of the business and as private individuals. The attitude of
the business to assisting its workers to create work–life balance can be used as an indicator of
whether the culture of that business is positive.

leading retailer of home improvement and
outdoor living products, and a major supplier
to project builders, commercial tradespeople
and the housing industry.
Bunnings engages with the communities in
which it operates, and actively contributes to
causes and organisations that benefit these
communities.
It employs more than 50 000 team members
(June 2022), and has a stated ambition to
provide its customers with the widest range
of home improvement products in accordance
with its lowest prices policy, backed with the

Physical environment and material symbols
Physical environment is a significant indicator of
culture. Open-plan offices, for example, promote lateral
communication, team building and collaboration. The
location of a business also affects its culture. For example, an
inner-city ‘hipster’ location will promote an entirely different
culture from a business located in an outer suburban area.
Similarly, a traditional CBD location will promote a different
culture from a business in a rural location.
Material symbols representing status in an organisation are
another physical indicator. For instance, do senior managers
have bigger offices than middle managers? Are there
separate cafeterias for blue-collar and white-collar workers?
Other physical indicators of culture can include colour and
design of staff uniforms or the colour used in the decoration of the office space.

ACTIVITY 2.7
1 Brainstorm some examples of the observable elements of corporate culture. Then, select a
business you are familiar with and identify the observable elements of its corporate culture.
2 Explain why it is important for a business to maintain an appealing official corporate
culture.
3 Identify potential consequences to a business if its ‘real corporate culture’ is judged as
being ‘toxic’.
Stories, narratives and rituals
The importance of creating stories and narratives about
significant events and/or people in the business, such as its
founders, cannot be overlooked. The people about whom
stories are told often then become ‘heroes’ for that business.
Displaying pictures of these people in the foyer or reception
area will show the pride and esteem in which they are valued.
Establishing and acknowledging rituals that express key
values and expectations within a business should be
encouraged. Examples of these are recognition and reward
ceremonies, weekly social get-togethers, participating in
social club activities or the annual Christmas party. These
rituals help to underscore the importance placed on the
positive benefits gained through social interaction in the
workplace and the celebration of a job well done.
Figure 2.12 Office celebrations strengthen employee relations and
highlight the importance of acknowledging good work.
A positive corporate culture is a vital component for any business in developing and
maintaining its competitive edge. While a business will have developed an official corporate
culture by implementing the strategies outlined in this chapter, observing the real culture will
show what is actually occurring. The COVID-19 pandemic has been among the most stressful
and challenging times that current businesses and employees have experienced. Hard times
reflect character in both individuals and businesses. If a business has survived, and adapted in
the way it serves its customers, employees and stakeholders during this challenging period,
then it is demonstrating a positive culture in action.ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

COGNITIVE LEVEL: toLevel5 (Analyze & Evaluate)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TARGET: Break down relationships, make judgments, assess validity.
TEST: Can student compare, contrast, infer, critique, or synthesise?
QUESTION TYPES: Compare/contrast, identify relationships, evaluate claims, infer from data, critique reasoning.
STEMS: "Which conclusion is supported by...", "Compare X and Y...", "The evidence suggests...", "Evaluate the claim that..."
REQUIRE: Multi-step reasoning. May include data, scenarios, or competing claims to evaluate.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Exactly 10 questions total matching the specified mix (8 MC, 2 Cloze, 0 TF)
- LENGTH PARITY: All MC options must be similar length. Do NOT make correct answer longer than distractors. Keep correct answers pithy OR extend all distractors to match.
- All distractors must be real misconceptions, never absurd
- Verify factual accuracy—do not hallucinate
- One unambiguous correct answer per question
- Include the _link block exactly as shown with actual values
- Output raw JSON only
