      "question": "A regional Australian city relies on a coal mine employing 2,000 people. The government announces a transition to renewable energy that will phase out coal over 15 years. Evaluate the economic implications for this community.",
      "correct": "The transition creates long-term economic risk but also opportunities if alternative industries are developed",
      "correctExplanation": "While the mine's closure threatens employment and local spending, planned transition provides time to develop renewable energy jobs, tourism or other industries.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The community will suffer no economic impact because government policy protects all jobs", "explanation": "Government policy cannot prevent job losses from industry transition; it can only support adjustment and new opportunities." },

      "correct": "Policies supporting small business viability are crucial for overall employment and economic stability",
      "correctExplanation": "Given their dominance in numbers and employment, policies that affect small businesses have an outsized impact on the broader economy.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Small businesses are economically insignificant because they individually generate less revenue", "explanation": "While individual revenues are smaller, collectively small businesses are essential for employment and economic diversity." },

      "correctExplanation": "JobKeeper acknowledged that if businesses collapsed, the resulting unemployment and economic contraction would be far more costly than the subsidy itself.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "JobKeeper was unnecessary because business closures have no impact on the broader economy", "explanation": "Mass business closures would have caused catastrophic unemployment and economic collapse, justifying government intervention." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Bailouts are never justified because businesses should always survive on their own merits", "explanation": "While market discipline is important, systemic crises can destroy viable businesses, making targeted intervention economically rational." },
