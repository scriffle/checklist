      "correct": "List publicly, as capital needs exceed private capacity",
      "correctExplanation": "With only two shareholder spots remaining and a $200 million target, the company's capital-raising capacity is severely limited as a Pty Ltd; a public listing opens access to far larger investment pools.",
