      "question": "Why might a conflict arise between management and customers?",
      "correct": "Management may cut quality to reduce costs while customers expect fair value",
      "correctExplanation": "A key conflict occurs when management reduces the quality of goods or services to save money, but customers still expect quality products at a fair price.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Management always provides the highest quality products at the lowest prices", "explanation": "This is not always the case. Management may prioritise cost savings over maintaining quality, creating conflict with customers." },
        { "answer": "Customers prefer lower quality goods if it means faster delivery times", "explanation": "Customers generally expect quality products at a fair price, not lower quality in exchange for speed." },
        { "answer": "Management and customers always share the same goals and priorities", "explanation": "Management may prioritise profit through cost-cutting while customers prioritise receiving quality goods and services." }

      "question": "What do customers generally expect from a business?",
      "correct": "Quality products at a fair price",
      "correctExplanation": "Customers expect to receive goods or services that are of reasonable quality and priced fairly for the value they provide.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Free products with no conditions attached", "explanation": "Customers understand they must pay for goods and services, but they expect fair value for the price charged." },
        { "answer": "Products that are expensive regardless of their quality", "explanation": "Customers want the price to reflect the quality of the product, not to pay high prices for low-quality items." },
        { "answer": "Only the cheapest option with no concern for quality", "explanation": "While price matters, customers also care about quality and expect a reasonable standard for what they pay." }

      "question": "A department store reduces staff on the shop floor to save on wages. What is the most likely impact on customers?",
      "correct": "Longer wait times and poorer customer service",
      "correctExplanation": "Fewer staff members means customers wait longer for assistance and receive a lower standard of service.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Customers receive faster and more personalised assistance", "explanation": "Reducing staff numbers typically leads to slower service, not faster, as fewer workers are available to help customers." },

      "question": "What does it mean when management 'cuts costs without lowering prices'?",
      "correct": "The business spends less on production but charges customers the same amount",
      "correctExplanation": "This means management reduces expenses such as materials or labour while maintaining the same selling price, which may reduce product quality.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The business increases spending on production and raises prices simultaneously", "explanation": "Cutting costs means reducing spending, not increasing it. Prices remain unchanged in this scenario." },

        { "answer": "The business stops selling products entirely to save money on operations", "explanation": "Cutting costs refers to reducing expenses in production or service, not ceasing all sales activity." }

      "question": "Justify why a business should prioritise customer satisfaction even when it conflicts with short-term profit maximisation.",
      "correct": "Customer loyalty drives sustainable revenue, and losing trust is far more costly to rebuild than the savings from cost-cutting",
      "correctExplanation": "Long-term profitability depends on repeat customers and positive reputation. The cost of acquiring new customers to replace lost ones exceeds short-term savings.",
      "distractors": [

      "correctExplanation": "Efficiency gains reduce costs without affecting what the customer receives, avoiding the conflict that arises from cutting visible quality or service.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Reduce product quality gradually so customers do not notice the change over time", "explanation": "Gradual quality reduction is still deceptive and customers will eventually notice, leading to dissatisfaction and lost trust." },

      "correctExplanation": "Modern customers share experiences online. When portion reductions are discovered, viral negative publicity can damage the brand far more than the savings gained.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Customers will never notice the reduction because packaging remains unchanged and portion sizes are difficult to measure", "explanation": "Customers notice value changes over time, and social media accelerates the spread of such discoveries." },

      "correct": "Transparently raising prices is more sustainable because it preserves customer trust even if some customers leave",
      "correctExplanation": "Honesty about price increases allows customers to make informed choices, preserving trust. Hidden quality reductions erode trust when discovered, causing greater long-term damage.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Silently reducing quality is always more sustainable because customers never discover the changes made", "explanation": "Customers eventually notice quality changes, and the loss of trust from deception causes more damage than transparent pricing." },
        { "answer": "Both approaches produce identical outcomes because customers do not distinguish between price and quality changes", "explanation": "Customers respond very differently to transparent communication compared to deceptive practices." },

      "correctExplanation": "While competition does discipline quality in some markets, customers may lack alternatives, face costs to switch, or not know about quality reductions, limiting the self-correcting mechanism.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The argument is completely valid and applies equally to all markets without any exceptions or limitations", "explanation": "Markets with monopoly power, high switching costs, or limited information do not self-correct as effectively as competitive ones." },
