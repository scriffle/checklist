    { "type": "mc", "question": "What is an autocratic management style?", "correct": "A style where the manager makes decisions alone without employee input", "correctExplanation": "Autocratic managers are task-focused and centralise decision-making, giving employees little involvement.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "A style where all employees vote on every business decision equally", "explanation": "Voting on decisions describes a democratic or participative style, not an autocratic one." }, { "answer": "A style where no manager exists and employees lead themselves entirely", "explanation": "Self-management is a different concept. Autocratic style features strong centralised authority." }, { "answer": "A style where decisions are made by external consultants for the business", "explanation": "External consultants advise but do not replace management styles. Autocratic means the manager decides alone." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "What is a participative management style?", "correct": "A style where employees contribute to the decision-making process", "correctExplanation": "Participative managers value worker input and involve them in discussions and decisions.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "A style where only the CEO makes every single business decision", "explanation": "CEO-only decision-making is autocratic. Participative style involves employees in the process." }, { "answer": "A style where employees are not allowed to speak during meetings", "explanation": "Silencing employees is the opposite of participation. Participative style encourages employee voice." }, { "answer": "A style where the government controls all business management decisions", "explanation": "Government control is not a management style. Participative means employees contribute to decisions." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "How does management style affect corporate culture?", "correct": "It shapes employees' daily experience and whether they feel valued", "correctExplanation": "The way managers interact with employees directly influences workplace atmosphere, trust, and motivation.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "It determines the exact products the business manufactures each year", "explanation": "Product decisions are strategic matters. Management style affects how people interact and feel at work." }, { "answer": "It has no effect on corporate culture because they are unrelated concepts", "explanation": "Management style is one of the most direct influences on corporate culture through daily interactions." }, { "answer": "It only affects the finance department and no other area of the business", "explanation": "Management style affects all employees across every department, not just finance." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "At Insentra, CEO Ronnie Altit holds weekly open calls with employees. What management style does this demonstrate?", "correct": "A participative style that encourages accessibility and transparency", "correctExplanation": "Open communication channels between the CEO and all employees demonstrate a participative, employee-centred approach.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "An autocratic style that prevents employees from voicing concerns", "explanation": "Open calls for questions and chat are participative, not autocratic. Autocratic managers limit employee input." }, { "answer": "A laissez-faire style where no management guidance is provided at all", "explanation": "The CEO actively engages with employees, which is participative. Laissez-faire involves minimal management involvement." }, { "answer": "A bureaucratic style focused solely on following written rules and procedures", "explanation": "Weekly informal calls are about building relationships, not enforcing bureaucratic procedures." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "Which management style is most likely to build trust between managers and employees?", "correct": "A participative style that values worker contributions", "correctExplanation": "When employees feel their input is valued and they are involved in decisions, trust grows between management and staff.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "An autocratic style that limits all communication to top-down orders", "explanation": "One-way communication and exclusion from decisions typically reduce trust rather than build it." }, { "answer": "A style that avoids all interaction between managers and their employees", "explanation": "Avoiding interaction prevents relationship building and trust development." }, { "answer": "A style where managers change their approach randomly each day", "explanation": "Inconsistent management creates uncertainty, which undermines trust." }] },

    { "type": "mc", "question": "How does an autocratic management style affect the corporate culture of a business?", "correct": "It tends to create a formal, compliance-based culture where employees follow instructions rather than contribute ideas", "correctExplanation": "Autocratic styles centralise power, which creates cultures focused on obedience rather than innovation and collaboration.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "It creates an open and creative culture where all employees feel empowered to take risks", "explanation": "Autocratic styles typically suppress employee initiative, creating the opposite of an empowered culture." }, { "answer": "It has no influence on culture because employees ignore their managers entirely", "explanation": "Employees are directly affected by management style. Autocratic approaches shape a formal, controlled culture." }, { "answer": "It always creates the most productive and efficient culture possible for any business", "explanation": "While autocratic styles can be efficient in some contexts, they often reduce creativity and employee engagement." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "Why might a business choose a participative style to develop a positive culture?", "correct": "Because involving employees in decisions increases their commitment, motivation, and sense of belonging", "correctExplanation": "Participation creates ownership of outcomes, which drives engagement and builds a positive cultural environment.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Because participative management means no one needs to take responsibility for anything", "explanation": "Participation distributes involvement, not avoidance of responsibility. Employees remain accountable for outcomes." }, { "answer": "Because it is legally required for all Australian businesses to use participative management", "explanation": "No law mandates a specific management style. Businesses choose participative styles for cultural benefits." }, { "answer": "Because employees always make better decisions than trained professional managers", "explanation": "The benefit is increased engagement and diverse perspectives, not that employees always make superior decisions." }] },

It is one of many valid management approaches." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "How does a consistent management style across all managers contribute to cultural coherence?", "correct": "It creates predictable expectations so employees know what behaviour is valued throughout the organisation", "correctExplanation": "Consistency in management approach builds a unified culture where expectations are clear and reliable.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Consistency in management style is impossible because all managers are completely different", "explanation": "While individual differences exist, businesses can train managers to apply consistent cultural principles." }, { "answer": "Having the same style everywhere is harmful because employees need constant surprises to stay motivated", "explanation": "Consistency provides stability and clarity. Unpredictable management creates stress and cultural confusion." }, { "answer": "Management style consistency only matters in the first year of a business's operations", "explanation": "Cultural consistency through management style is an ongoing requirement, not a one-time consideration." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "What might happen to corporate culture if a new CEO replaces a participative leader with an autocratic approach?", "correct": "Employee morale may decline as they lose involvement in decision-making and feel less valued", "correctExplanation": "A shift from participative to autocratic management disrupts established expectations, often damaging morale and engagement.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Nothing would change because employees quickly adapt to any management style without concern", "explanation": "Major style changes significantly affect employee satisfaction and cultural dynamics." }, { "answer": "Employee productivity would automatically double because autocratic leaders are more efficient", "explanation": "Autocratic leadership may initially increase control but often reduces motivation and long-term productivity." }, { "answer": "All employees would immediately resign because they refuse to work under any form of direction", "explanation": "While some may leave, most employees adapt, though often with reduced satisfaction and engagement." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "How does the '45 minutes with Ronnie' program at Insentra demonstrate the link between management style and culture?", "correct": "It shows that accessible leadership creates a culture of openness where employees feel comfortable asking questions", "correctExplanation": "The program makes leadership approachable, reinforcing a culture of transparency and mutual respect.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "It demonstrates that CEOs should avoid talking to employees to maintain professional distance", "explanation": "The program's purpose is the opposite — to reduce distance between leadership and employees." }, { "answer": "It proves that only 45 minutes per week of communication is needed to manage all employees", "explanation": "The program is one element of Insentra's broader participative culture, not the only communication strategy." }, { "answer": "It shows that management style only matters for technology companies, not for other industries", "explanation": "The principle that leadership accessibility builds culture applies across all industries." }] },

Different contexts can benefit from different approaches." }, { "answer": "All departments must use identical management styles because consistency is the only consideration", "explanation": "While cultural consistency matters, different tasks may genuinely benefit from different management approaches." }, { "answer": "Only the marketing department should use a participative style; all others should be autocratic", "explanation": "The choice of style depends on the specific context of each department, not a fixed rule." }] },

    { "type": "mc", "question": "How might a manager's personal style conflict with the business's desired corporate culture?", "correct": "An autocratic manager in a business that values collaboration may undermine the desired participative culture", "correctExplanation": "When individual management behaviour contradicts stated cultural values, it creates inconsistency between official and real culture.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "A manager's personal style never conflicts with corporate culture because managers always perfectly align", "explanation": "Conflicts between personal style and desired culture are common and must be addressed through training and feedback." }, { "answer": "Managers have no personal style because they all manage in exactly the same predetermined way", "explanation": "Managers have individual styles influenced by personality, training, and experience that may differ from cultural expectations." }, { "answer": "Corporate culture always adapts to match whatever style each individual manager prefers to use", "explanation": "Culture should guide management behaviour, not the other way around. Misalignment requires management development." }] },

Even when their specific suggestions are not adopted, the process builds respect." }, { "answer": "There is no difference between consultative and fully participative management styles at all", "explanation": "Consultative retains managerial authority while participative more fully shares decision-making power." }] },

Knowledge workers perform better with autonomy and trust." }, { "answer": "The shift to knowledge work has had no effect on which management styles are effective", "explanation": "The nature of work fundamentally affects which management approaches produce the best results." }, { "answer": "Knowledge workers do not need any form of management because they are entirely self-directed", "explanation": "Even knowledge workers benefit from management support, vision, and coordination, though through more participative approaches." }] },
