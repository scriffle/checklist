      "what": "A stakeholder is any individual or group that can either affect or be affected by the operations of a business. Stakeholders exist at all levels of the business environment.",
      "why": "Being able to clearly define this term is essential for all further analysis of stakeholder interests, conflicts, and responsibilities.",

      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Internal stakeholders are those within the business over which it has control. These include owners (or shareholders), directors, managers, and employees.",
      "why": "Internal stakeholders are closest to the daily operations and decision-making of the business, making them critical to its functioning and culture.",
      "example": "In a company like Coles, internal stakeholders include the board of directors who set strategy, store managers who run individual locations, and the thousands of employees who serve customers daily.",

      "code": "1.3",
      "what": "Operating environment stakeholders are immediately external to the business and interact closely with it. These include customers, suppliers, and competitors.",
      "why": "These stakeholders have a direct, regular impact on business operations, influencing revenue, costs, and competitive positioning.",
      "example": "For Woolworths, a key supplier of fresh produce is an operating environment stakeholder because their pricing, quality, and delivery reliability directly affect what Woolworths can offer customers.",

      "code": "1.4",
      "what": "Macro environment stakeholders include the general community and society. These operate in the broad environment over which the business has no direct control.",
      "why": "Even though a business cannot control macro stakeholders, their expectations around ethics, employment, and environmental responsibility shape how the business must operate.",
      "example": "The local community near a factory is a macro stakeholder because they are affected by potential pollution, noise, and traffic from the business, even though they have no direct business relationship with it.",

      "code": "1.5",
      "what": "The three levels are the internal environment (within the business), the operating environment (immediately external with close interaction), and the macro environment (broad conditions beyond the business's control).",
      "why": "Classifying stakeholders by environment level helps managers understand the degree of control they have over each relationship and tailor their strategies accordingly.",
      "example": "A manager at a real estate agency would classify their sales agents as internal environment stakeholders, their property-listing clients as operating environment stakeholders, and the broader suburban community as macro environment stakeholders.",

      "why": "These internal stakeholders drive the day-to-day operations of the business. Their satisfaction and motivation directly affect productivity, quality of service, and staff turnover.",

      "why": "Customers are the primary source of revenue for a business. Meeting their interests builds loyalty, repeat business, and a positive reputation.",

      "why": "Suppliers and competitors are key operating environment stakeholders. Their actions influence costs, product availability, and market dynamics.",

      "what": "Shareholders want to receive substantial dividends from profits, while owners and directors may prefer to retain a larger portion of profit to reinvest in building the business.",
      "why": "This is one of the most common stakeholder conflicts. How profit is distributed versus reinvested affects both short-term returns and long-term business growth.",
      "example": "At the end of a profitable year, shareholders of a company may want 80% of profit distributed as dividends, but the directors want to retain 60% to fund a new warehouse, leading to disagreement at the annual general meeting.",

      "why": "This conflict highlights the tension between cost minimisation and maintaining strong supply chain relationships. Poor management of this conflict can lead to supply disruptions or reduced product quality.",

      "what": "The Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Commonwealth) establishes guidelines for businesses regarding disclosure of product information including performance, composition, contents, design, construction, and packaging. Many businesses go beyond legal compliance by becoming signatories to initiatives like the Australian Packaging Covenant.",
      "why": "Legislation sets the minimum standard for responsible business conduct. Understanding this helps explain why some CSR actions are legally required while others are voluntary commitments that further enhance a business's reputation.",
      "example": "The Australian Packaging Covenant's 2025 targets include 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging and 70% of plastic packaging being recycled or composted. Signet, a packaging company, voluntarily became a signatory to help its customers meet these targets.",

      "why": "The VCE exam requires students to apply their knowledge to case studies and contemporary examples, not just recall definitions. Practising application builds deeper understanding.",
      "example": "Woolworths removed plastic shopping bags entirely in 2022 (having replaced free single-use bags with 15-cent reusable bags in 2018). Analysing this involves identifying which stakeholders are affected (customers, community, suppliers of alternative bags) and evaluating whether the strategy strengthens Woolworths' reputation and long-term viability.",

      "why": "This is a foundational definition that underpins all further discussion of culture in business management. A clear understanding is essential for exam responses.",

It represents 'who we say we are and what we say we do'.",
      "why": "Official culture sets the standard and aspiration for the business. It communicates to stakeholders what the business stands for and provides a benchmark against which actual behaviour can be measured.",

      "example": "A real estate agency may have an official culture focused on client satisfaction, but if agents regularly arrive late, forget client appointments, and show little interest in attracting new listings, the real culture is one of low accountability and poor service.",

      "example": "Carrington Pty Ltd, a real estate agency, has an official culture stating 'Happy clients are our first priority', but a management consultant found that agents were uninterested in attracting clients and customer service was poor — showing a significant gap between official and real culture that was costing market share.",

      "what": "The structure of a business determines how work tasks are divided, who holds authority, and how communication flows. Traditional hierarchical structures have three levels (senior, middle, front-line management). Many businesses have moved to flatter structures through delayering, which increases employee involvement and reduces status distinctions.",
      "why": "Structure shapes daily interactions, decision-making, and communication. A flatter structure tends to promote a more collaborative, participative culture, while a tall hierarchy may reinforce a more formal, top-down culture.",
      "example": "A business that removes a layer of middle management (delayering) may find that employees feel more empowered to contribute ideas, communication improves, and the culture shifts from autocratic to participative.",
