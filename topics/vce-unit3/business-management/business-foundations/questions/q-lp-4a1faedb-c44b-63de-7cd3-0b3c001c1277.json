      "correct": "Decisions can be made quickly alone",
      "correctExplanation": "Because there are no other owners, the sole trader can make decisions immediately without consulting partners, a board of directors, or shareholders.",
      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It increases the cost of wages", "explanation": "Relying on the owner's skills does not directly increase wage costs. The disadvantage is about limited expertise, not higher expenses." },

        { "answer": "It requires formal qualifications", "explanation": "There is no general legal requirement for sole traders to hold formal qualifications. The disadvantage is about the practical limitation of one person's knowledge." }

      "correct": "The risk to personal assets outweighs the simplicity benefits",
      "correctExplanation": "For a high-risk business where the owner has significant personal assets, unlimited liability poses a serious threat. The simplicity of a sole trader structure does not compensate for the potential loss of personal wealth.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The simplicity benefits outweigh the financial risk involved", "explanation": "While simplicity is an advantage, the high-risk nature of food manufacturing combined with significant personal assets makes the potential downside far greater than the benefit of easy setup." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both structures offer identical decision-making speed overall", "explanation": "Partnerships typically require consultation and agreement among partners, which slows decision-making compared to a sole trader acting alone." },

      "correct": "It ignores the owner's risk tolerance and growth plans",
      "correctExplanation": "The best structure depends on individual circumstances including the owner's appetite for risk, the nature of the business, plans for growth, and the need for additional finance or expertise.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It is correct because all small businesses should start simply", "explanation": "While simplicity is appealing, factors such as unlimited liability, limited access to finance, and lack of perpetuity may make other structures more appropriate." },
        { "answer": "It is wrong because sole traders cannot legally operate", "explanation": "Sole traders can legally operate in Australia. The claim is flawed not because the structure is illegal, but because it is not universally the best option." },

      "correct": "The sole trader likely pays more tax at that income level",
      "correctExplanation": "At $200,000 income, the individual marginal tax rate in Australia is significantly higher than the 25% company rate, meaning the sole trader structure results in a greater tax burden.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The sole trader pays less tax due to personal deductions only", "explanation": "While sole traders can claim deductions, the higher marginal tax rate at $200,000 typically results in more tax paid overall compared to the company rate." },
        { "answer": "Both structures pay exactly the same total amount in taxes", "explanation": "Individual and company tax rates differ significantly. At $200,000, the progressive individual rate is higher than the flat 25% company rate." },

      "correctExplanation": "A tech startup typically needs significant capital, diverse expertise, and long-term continuity. The sole trader's limited access to finance, reliance on one person, and lack of perpetuity make it poorly suited.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The advantages fully compensate for all risks", "explanation": "While simplicity and control are benefits, they cannot compensate for the critical need for capital and expertise that technology startups require." },

      "correctExplanation": "Without perpetuity, a buyer cannot simply take over the existing legal entity. They must establish a new business, which reduces the transferable value of goodwill, contracts and relationships.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It has no effect on the business value", "explanation": "The inability to transfer the business as a going concern directly affects its value. Buyers pay less when they must recreate the legal structure from scratch." },
        { "answer": "It increases value due to scarcity of trades", "explanation": "While demand for trade services may be high, the lack of perpetuity is a structural limitation that reduces transferability and therefore sale value." },
        { "answer": "It means the business must be given away free", "explanation": "Sole trader businesses can still be sold, including their equipment, client lists and goodwill. The lack of perpetuity reduces value but does not eliminate it entirely." }
