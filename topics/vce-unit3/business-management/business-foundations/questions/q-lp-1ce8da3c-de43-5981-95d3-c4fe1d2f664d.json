      "correct": "Incorporation involves costs and regulation that may not suit small businesses",
      "correctExplanation": "While limited liability is valuable, incorporation requires compliance with the Corporations Act, ASIC reporting, and associated costs that may outweigh the benefits for very small or low-risk businesses.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because every business needs limited liability always", "explanation": "Not every business needs limited liability. Small, low-risk businesses may prefer the simplicity and lower cost of operating as a sole trader or partnership." },
        { "answer": "The claim is wrong because incorporation provides no real advantages ever", "explanation": "Incorporation provides significant advantages including limited liability and perpetuity. The claim is flawed because it oversimplifies, not because incorporation has no benefits." },
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because ASIC encourages all businesses to incorporate", "explanation": "ASIC does not encourage all businesses to incorporate. It is a regulatory body, not an advisory service. The appropriate structure depends on individual circumstances." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Partnerships face more regulation than companies do overall", "explanation": "Partnerships face minimal regulation compared to companies. The Corporations Act imposes extensive requirements on incorporated businesses." },

      "correct": "Limited liability outweighs compliance costs at that scale",
      "correctExplanation": "At $500,000 in revenue, the business faces significant financial risk. The protection of personal assets through limited liability becomes more valuable than the cost of regulatory compliance.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Incorporation eliminates the need to pay any tax at all", "explanation": "Incorporated companies still pay tax. The motivation for incorporating is asset protection through limited liability, not tax elimination." },
        { "answer": "ASIC requires all businesses earning over $500,000 to incorporate", "explanation": "There is no mandatory incorporation threshold based on revenue. The decision to incorporate is voluntary and based on the owner's assessment of benefits versus costs." },
        { "answer": "Sole traders earning $500,000 are automatically converted to companies", "explanation": "There is no automatic conversion. Incorporation is a deliberate choice that the owner must actively pursue." }

      "distractors": [
