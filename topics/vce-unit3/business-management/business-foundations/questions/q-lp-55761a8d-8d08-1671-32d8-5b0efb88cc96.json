      "correct": "General offers control but unlimited risk; limited offers safety but no control",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because limited liability is always preferable overall", "explanation": "Limited liability benefits passive investors, but general partners may prefer full management control. The best structure depends on individual circumstances." },

      "correctExplanation": "In a general partnership, each partner can bind the others through their decisions. One partner's poor choices can expose all partners to significant financial liability.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The other partners have no legal recourse at all available", "explanation": "Partners can take legal action against a partner who breaches their duties. The partnership agreement or the Partnership Act may provide remedies." },
