      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Partners must get court approval for deals", "explanation": "Partners do not need court approval for business decisions. The agency relationship means they can independently create binding obligations." },

      "correct": "Multiple partners can contribute funds",

      "correct": "Partnerships gain shared risk but add the risk of disputes",
      "correctExplanation": "While partnerships benefit from shared risk and broader skills, they introduce the disadvantage of potential conflicts between partners, which sole traders avoid by operating alone.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Partnerships have fewer disadvantages than sole traders overall", "explanation": "Both structures have significant disadvantages. Partnerships add risks such as disputes and agency binding that sole traders do not face." },
        { "answer": "Sole traders always outperform partnerships in every industry", "explanation": "Performance depends on the business, market, and management, not solely on the business structure." },

      "question": "Evaluate the claim: 'The agency relationship between partners is the most significant disadvantage of a partnership.'",
      "correct": "It is significant because one partner can create obligations for all",
      "correctExplanation": "The agency relationship means a single partner's decisions can legally bind all others, creating financial exposure without their knowledge or consent. This is a substantial risk.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It is insignificant because partners always agree on everything", "explanation": "Partners do not always agree. The agency risk is real and significant because one partner can commit the firm without consulting others." },
        { "answer": "It is the only disadvantage that exists for partnerships overall", "explanation": "Partnerships have multiple disadvantages including unlimited liability, no perpetuity, and potential disputes. Agency binding is one of several." },

      "correct": "The partnership must dissolve despite its long history",
      "correctExplanation": "Regardless of how long a partnership has existed, the departure of a partner requires dissolution because the structure lacks perpetuity. A new partnership must be formed by the remaining partners.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The 20-year history grants the business perpetuity now", "explanation": "Length of operation does not create perpetuity. The lack of perpetuity is a structural feature that applies regardless of how long the partnership has existed." },
        { "answer": "The retiring partner keeps all the partnership assets", "explanation": "Partnership assets are distributed according to the partnership agreement or the Partnership Act, not automatically given to the departing partner." },

      "correctExplanation": "For professionals who trust each other and face manageable risk, the simplicity, lower setup costs and shared expertise of a partnership may outweigh the disadvantage of unlimited liability.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Partnerships provide better liability protection than companies do", "explanation": "Companies provide limited liability, which is better protection than the unlimited liability of partnerships. The doctors would accept more risk for other benefits." },

      "correct": "The disadvantages likely outweigh the advantages",
      "correctExplanation": "In a high-risk industry like construction, unlimited liability poses a serious threat to all partners' personal assets. The shared risk advantage is diminished when the overall risk level is high.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The advantages always outweigh the disadvantages completely", "explanation": "For high-risk businesses, the disadvantage of unlimited liability is amplified. Shared risk does not eliminate the fundamental exposure of personal assets." },
        { "answer": "Construction businesses cannot legally form partnerships ever", "explanation": "Construction businesses can form partnerships. The question is about suitability, not legality." },
        { "answer": "Risk level has no bearing on the suitability of any structure", "explanation": "Risk level is a critical factor in choosing a business structure. High-risk businesses may be better suited to limited liability structures." }

      "correctExplanation": "Each additional partner adds skills and capital but also adds another voice in decision-making. More partners increase the likelihood of disagreements over strategy and operations.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "More partners always reduce the chance of any disputes arising", "explanation": "More partners actually increase the potential for disputes because there are more opinions and interests to reconcile." },
        { "answer": "The number of partners has no effect on business expertise at all", "explanation": "More partners typically bring a wider range of skills and knowledge, which is a recognised advantage of the structure." },

      "correct": "The partnership exposes personal wealth to greater risk",
      "correctExplanation": "A general partnership offers unlimited liability, putting the investor's entire personal wealth at risk. A private company would limit their liability to the amount invested.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The partnership offers stronger asset protection overall", "explanation": "Partnerships provide weaker asset protection than companies due to unlimited liability. Companies offer limited liability which better protects personal wealth." },
        { "answer": "Both structures provide identical levels of personal protection", "explanation": "General partnerships and private companies have fundamentally different liability structures. Partnerships expose personal assets while companies protect them." },

      "correct": "A deadlock that may threaten the partnership",
      "correctExplanation": "With equal partners and no mechanism to break ties, fundamental disagreements can create deadlocks that paralyse decision-making and may ultimately lead to dissolution.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The more experienced partner automatically wins", "explanation": "In an equal partnership, neither partner has automatic authority over the other. Experience does not create a legal right to override the other partner." },
        { "answer": "A court will make the business decision for them", "explanation": "Courts do not make business strategy decisions for partnerships. They may intervene if asked to dissolve the partnership, but not to decide on expansion." },
        { "answer": "The Partnership Act requires all partners to always agree", "explanation": "The Partnership Act provides default rules but does not require unanimous agreement on all decisions. Deadlocks are a practical risk, not a legal impossibility." }
