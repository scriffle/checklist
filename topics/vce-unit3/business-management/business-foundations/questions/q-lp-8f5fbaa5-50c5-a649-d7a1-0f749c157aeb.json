      "correctExplanation": "Public listing provides access to vast capital but requires extensive disclosure, reduces founder control through ownership dilution, and increases regulatory costs and complexity.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There are no trade-offs because public listing is always superior", "explanation": "Public listing involves significant trade-offs. Many successful companies choose to remain private because the costs and loss of control outweigh the capital benefits." },
