      "question": "A mining company claims it contributes significantly to the Australian economy through employment and taxation. Environmental groups argue the company causes environmental damage. Evaluate both perspectives.",
      "correct": "Both perspectives have merit; economic contributions must be weighed against environmental costs to determine net benefit",
      "correctExplanation": "The company does contribute employment and taxation, but a complete evaluation must also consider environmental costs that may offset some economic benefits.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Only the economic contribution matters because businesses exist to make profit", "explanation": "A balanced evaluation must consider all impacts; environmental damage has real economic and social costs." },
        { "answer": "Only the environmental damage matters because the economy can function without mining", "explanation": "Mining contributes significantly to Australia's economy; dismissing its contributions is not a balanced evaluation." },
        { "answer": "Neither perspective is relevant because businesses operate independently of the economy", "explanation": "Businesses are integral to the economy; both economic and environmental impacts are relevant." }

      "correct": "Both contribute but in different ways: the multinational offers scale while sole traders provide distributed local employment and services",
      "correctExplanation": "Large businesses contribute through scale, exports and infrastructure while small businesses contribute through local employment, services and community connection.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Only the multinational makes meaningful economic contributions due to its size", "explanation": "Small businesses collectively create significant employment and economic activity at the local level." },

      "question": "Assess why governments both regulate businesses and support them. Are these contradictory objectives?",
      "correct": "They are complementary: regulation ensures businesses operate fairly while support helps them thrive and contribute more",
      "correctExplanation": "Regulation creates a fair and safe business environment while support measures help businesses grow, creating a larger economic contribution.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "They are contradictory because regulation always harms business growth and profitability", "explanation": "Well-designed regulation creates trust and stability that can support rather than hinder business growth." },
        { "answer": "They are contradictory because support eliminates the need for any regulation at all", "explanation": "Support and regulation serve different purposes; both are needed for a well-functioning economy." },
        { "answer": "They are unrelated because regulation and support come from different levels of government", "explanation": "Both can come from any level of government and are deliberately coordinated as complementary policies." }

      "correct": "Business closures led to unemployment, reduced tax revenue and disrupted supply chains, demonstrating deep economic interdependence",
      "correctExplanation": "The pandemic showed that when businesses stop operating, the effects cascade through employment, government revenue, supply chains and consumer spending.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Business closures had no economic impact because the government replaced all lost income", "explanation": "Government support helped but could not fully replace the economic activity of operating businesses." },

      "correct": "Employment is crucial but all five contributions are interconnected and reinforce each other",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because without employment, no other economic activity can occur", "explanation": "While employment is important, businesses also contribute through innovation, taxation, infrastructure and goods provision independently." },

      "correctExplanation": "Tax incentives attract investment and create jobs but reduce immediate tax revenue and may not create permanent economic activity if the business leaves when incentives end.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There are only benefits because any new business improves the economy without any risk", "explanation": "Tax incentives involve trade-offs; reduced tax revenue and potential business departure are real risks." },

      "distractors": [
