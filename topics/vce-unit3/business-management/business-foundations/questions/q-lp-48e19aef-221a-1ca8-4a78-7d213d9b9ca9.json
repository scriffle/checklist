      "correct": "The claim is wrong because they use commercial strategies to earn revenue",
      "correctExplanation": "Social enterprises are genuine businesses that sell goods and services, manage costs, and earn revenue. They simply direct profits towards social outcomes rather than maximising returns to owners.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because only profit-focused businesses are real", "explanation": "Business is defined by commercial activity, not solely by profit maximisation. Social enterprises operate commercially while pursuing social goals." },

      "correct": "The tension requires careful management to sustain both goals",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There is never any tension between the two goals at all", "explanation": "Tension does exist. Decisions about pricing, expansion, and resource allocation require balancing commercial and social priorities." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Only traditional businesses can earn any profits at all ever", "explanation": "Social enterprises do earn profits. The difference is in how those profits are used, not whether they exist." },
