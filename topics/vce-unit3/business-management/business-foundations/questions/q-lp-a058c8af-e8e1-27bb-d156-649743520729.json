      "correct": "The Act provides defaults but cannot address unique arrangements",
      "correctExplanation": "While the Act provides basic default rules, a tailored agreement addresses specific arrangements like unequal profit shares, individual roles, and customised dispute resolution that the Act cannot anticipate.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because the Act is fully comprehensive today", "explanation": "The Act provides generic default provisions. It cannot account for the specific needs, roles, and financial arrangements unique to each partnership." },

      "correct": "It depends on each partner's non-financial contributions",
      "correctExplanation": "If the partner who contributed less capital provides more labour, expertise, or time, a 50/50 split may be fair despite unequal capital. Appropriateness depends on the total value each partner brings.",
      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Going directly to court is always faster and cheaper overall", "explanation": "Court proceedings are typically slower and more expensive than mediation. Mediation offers a quicker resolution for many partnership disputes." },
