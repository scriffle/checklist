      "correct": "It depends on whether the company needs to raise capital widely",
      "correctExplanation": "For family businesses wanting ownership control, the restriction is beneficial. For businesses needing to raise large amounts of capital from many investors, it can be limiting.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is always correct for every Pty Ltd company", "explanation": "The significance of this restriction varies by business. Family businesses may see it as an advantage, not a disadvantage." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both structures offer identical levels of asset protection overall", "explanation": "The structures offer fundamentally different levels of protection. Pty Ltd provides limited liability while partnerships expose personal assets." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There is no trade-off because Pty Ltd can raise unlimited capital", "explanation": "The 50-shareholder cap and restricted share transfers genuinely limit how much capital a Pty Ltd can raise compared to a public company." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The company should remain a Pty Ltd and reduce its operations", "explanation": "Reducing operations would limit growth. Converting to a public company is a more effective way to access the capital needed for expansion." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because Pty Ltd companies pay no tax under Australian law today", "explanation": "Pty Ltd companies pay company tax. The choice is driven by liability protection and structural benefits, not tax exemption." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "No, because regulation provides no benefit to any stakeholder at all", "explanation": "Regulation protects creditors, employees, and the public by ensuring transparency and accountability from companies with limited liability." },
