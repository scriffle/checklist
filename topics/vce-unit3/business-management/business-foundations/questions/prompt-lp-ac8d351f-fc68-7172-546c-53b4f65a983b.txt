TITLE: I can distinguish between vision statements, mission statements and values statements
CODE: 1.2

WHAT (concept explanation):
A vision statement outlines what the business aspires to be in the future. A mission statement defines what the business wants to achieve now. A values statement outlines the organisation's corporate values, centring on integrity, honesty and ethical behaviour.

WHY (importance):
These statements provide the overarching direction from which specific business objectives are developed and aligned.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Virgin Australia's vision is 'to revolutionise air travel again, this time across all market segments'. Its mission focuses on providing seamless experiences across domestic and international markets.

SUBTOPIC: Financial and Market Objectives
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the objectives of making a profit, increasing market share and fulfilling a market need, as well as the SMART principle for setting effective objectives and the role of vision, mission and values statements.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Financial and market objectives drive strategic decisions in business. Understanding how to set, apply and evaluate these objectives is essential for analysing real and simulated business scenarios.

Businesses in Australia
The way a business is run and the role of the owner(s) varies depending on how those owners
wish to be involved and the various legal implications of different forms of ownership and legal
structure.
Australia operates as a mixed market economy where ownership of resources, property and
factors of production are shared between private individuals and governments. The majority
of businesses are owned by private individuals, groups or institutions, and these are classified
as being in the private sector. There are, however, a significant number of government-owned
businesses that are classified as being in the public sector.
Businesses are integral to the successful functioning of the domestic (Australian) and global
economy. They are important because they:
•
manufacture and sell goods and/or provide services to consumers either in Australia and/or
•
•
•
•
globally
create employment
provide taxation income to the government directly from their earnings
are an important source of innovation and product development
provide infrastructure.

Sole trader
If an individual wants to establish or run a business, becoming a sole trader is the simplest and
most inexpensive form of business structure. It involves a single owner operating a business
under either their own name or a Registered Business Name (RBN). The sole trader assumes
total responsibility for the major decisions of the business relating to planning and operations.
They have the sole right to all profits and capital of the business.
However, in the event of the business incurring losses or debts, the sole trader as the owner is
held totally legally responsible for all debts of the business (unlimited liability). This means
that the owner’s personal assets can be seized to recover a debt. The business may operate
using the personal bank account and tax file number (TFN) of the owner; however, there
is a requirement that the financial records of the business must be retained for at least five
years. A sole trader may employ people to help them run the business. If they choose to do
this, there are several compulsory obligations that must be complied with, including making
superannuation contributions on behalf of employees and obtaining workers’ compensation
insurance. Sole traders are recommended to apply for an RBN as a form of protection for their
business identity and to give their business legitimacy.
Many businesses initially set up as sole traders then progress to other forms of business
structure.

ACTIVITY 1.1
Simon had been working as a pastry chef with a busy restaurant in the city prior to the COVID-19
pandemic. The restaurant decided that due to the numerous lockdowns that had occurred in
Melbourne it would have to close. Simon had created a good reputation for himself, especially
for his pastries and desserts, and was often appearing on reviews on Instagram posted by diners
at the restaurant. Simon decided to try operating a cooking business from his home. Although
known as a good pastry chef, Simon knew nothing about running a business and the type of
business structure he should set up. A friend had suggested that he should become a sole trader.
1 Outline for Simon what it means to be a sole trader.
2 Analyse for Simon what would be the advantages and disadvantages of adopting this form
of business structure for his new catering venture.
Partnership
A business partnership combines the expertise and resources of between two and 20 people
going into business together. Each partner is jointly liable for business debts incurred (unlimited
liability).

There are two types of business partnership:
•
•
general partnership – all partners are deemed equally responsible for management of the
business. Each has unlimited liability for debts and obligations.
limited partnership – liability of one or more partners is limited. These partners (passive
investors) are not involved in day-to-day business operations. Liability is limited in
proportion to the amount invested.
The Partnership Act 1958 (Vic) sets out the rights and duties of the persons involved in
a partnership. Most partnerships are based on a formal legal agreement (partnership
agreement) being entered into by the parties.

must be formed. In other words, there is no perpetuity. It is generally accepted that a person
should only enter into a business partnership with people whom they completely trust, since a
business partner may be liable for their partner’s debts.

Company
Many business owners opt to establish a separate legal entity, being a company, which is
achieved through the process of incorporation. Prior to the company being formed, the business
owners should undertake a name availability search to check whether the name they would like
is available or whether it has already been allocated to another company. The Business Names
Registration Act 2011 sets out words that may not be included in a company name. The company
needs to be formed according to legislation, the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act), and is
then registered with the
Australian Securities and
Investments Commission
(ASIC). An Australian
Company Number (ACN)
must be obtained, and
this number must be
placed on every public
document of the business.
In addition, the business
must designate a registered

Private limited company
A private limited company is easily recognised by its name, as it includes the words ‘Proprietary
Limited’, which are often shortened to ‘Pty Ltd’, at the end of the name. This classification works
to place some restrictions on how this type of company operates:
•
•
•
•
shareholders – the company has a minimum of one shareholder and is restricted to a
maximum of 50 non-employee shareholders
shares – can only be traded with the permission of other shareholders, which must be given
before any transaction takes place
directors – at least one (who lives in Australia)
company secretary – optional.

This form of company is popular with businesses that have previously operated as sole traders
or partnerships but would now like to expand, while also gaining the protection that comes
from creating a separate legal entity and limiting their liability for debts incurred by the
business. It is also a favoured business structure for family businesses wanting to create an
ongoing business structure for future generations of the family.

ACTIVITY 1.2
Barry and his family run a red gum furniture manufacturing business in country Victoria. They
make large items of furniture, such as tables, chairs, sideboards and bookshelves, with the offcuts
of wood being made into chopping boards and bowls. Established initially by Barry as a family
partnership with his two sons, the business now employs five other craftspeople in the factory
to help them keep up with orders. The sales showroom is in the main street of the town and is
very popular with both locals and tourists. Barry does not feel comfortable dealing directly with
customers, preferring to leave the sales negotiations to his five sales staff. Some of the family
members have expressed a desire that the business now change from being a partnership to
become a private limited company.
Barry would like your advice as to the advantages and disadvantages of changing the structure of
the business from a partnership to a private limited company. What would you propose?
Public listed company
As businesses grow in the size of their operations, they may look to the option of becoming a
public company as a means of increasing their number of shares and access to more capital.
To do this the business needs to issue a prospectus, which is a formal document inviting the
public to purchase its shares. A public company does not have any upper limit restrictions
placed on it as to its number of shareholders. Once listed on the Australian Securities
Exchange (ASX), the shares in the company can be openly traded, with the price of the shares

being dependent upon the value perceived by the marketplace. These companies can be
recognised by the word ‘Limited’ (Ltd) after their name, which shows that they offer limited
liability to their shareholders.
There are some restrictions on how this type of company operates:

Social enterprises
A social enterprise is a type of business that uses strategies to maximise improvements
in human wellbeing or the environment, rather than to maximise profits for its social
entrepreneur owners or shareholders. Whether they are structured as ‘for-profit’ or ‘not-for-
profit’ entities, social enterprises have two main goals: to achieve social, cultural, community
or environmental outcomes, and to earn revenue. Social enterprises are innovative
and sustainable.
Social enterprises are run like a business, as they produce goods or services to sell, but redirect
the surplus in pursuit of social or environmental goals. In other words, a social enterprise aims
to make a profit in order to help solve a social or environmental problem. The majority of
social enterprises adopt the legal structure of a company. To assist them in the management
of their business, the social entrepreneurs behind the business will seek to appoint directors
to their boards who are specialists in key areas, including community development, business,
vocational training, law and accountancy.
It is estimated that there are in excess of 20 000 social enterprises operating across every
industry within the Australian economy. The majority operate as small businesses (73%) and
target their business activities towards assisting people with disability (35%), young people (33%)ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

and disadvantaged women (28%). In Victoria, 1.8 per cent of the state’s workforce (i.e. 60 000 jobs)
is created by social enterprises, contributing $5.2 billion to the Victorian economy (Source: CSI
Swinburne).
Social enterprises are encouraged (if possible) to obtain Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status
from the Australian Taxation Office, making all donations above $2 to their enterprise fully tax
deductible. This enables them to offer donors the additional advantage of being able to claim
that donation off their taxation, so reducing the donor’s tax liability.
Many social entrepreneurs have great ideas and a social conscience but need some extra
assistance and support to make their enterprise viable and investment-ready. Two groups are
prominent in meeting this need. Social Traders is a not-for-profit organisation formed in 2008
with the purpose of supporting and encouraging the establishment of commercially viable
social enterprises throughout Australia. The Alliance of Social Enterprise Networks Australia
represents seven social enterprise networks in each state and territory.

Social enterprises:
HoMie (Homelessness
of Melbourne
Incorporated
Enterprise)
The idea behind HoMie began in 2013 after a
group of friends (Marcus Crook, Nick Pearce
and Robbie Gillies) talked to people living on
the streets. They then shared these stories
via their Facebook page ‘Homelessness of
Melbourne’, created to connect with people
experiencing homelessness, thus giving them a
platform to be heard and understood.
and make donating easier through innovative
platforms.
In mid-2016, HoMie opened a permanent
shopfront in Fitzroy where it began selling its
own T-shirts, sweatpants and tops that were
made in ethically accredited factories in China.
Marcus and Nick established this social
enterprise in 2015 with its primary mission
to provide pathways out of homelessness.
HoMie places importance on the following
values: inclusivity, connection, respect and
transparency in all its actions. It does this
by providing new clothing, training and
job opportunities to people experiencing
homelessness. Its other goals are to
change negative public attitudes towards
homelessness, mobilise human compassion
Over time, HoMie has grown to now running
two social impact programs. One of these is VIP
Shopping days, when it closes the shop to the
public one day a month, so people affected by
homelessness can come and select five items
of clothing and enjoy both a free haircut and
lunch. The other program is the HoMie Pathway
Alliance Program. Since its inception in 2017,
this program has expanded and now partners
with Cotton On, the Hanes Group (Champion
and Bonds) and the Retail Prodigy Group (Nike
and TOMS) to provide training (both on-the-job

and employment opportunities
for homeless people. After paying
staff wages, shop rent and paying
for their products to be made,
100 per cent of the profits goes
towards providing pathways out of
homelessness. It’s not just about
shelter, but empowering people to
learn, make social connections and
become self-sufficient. This is HoMie’s
long-term goal, because it leads to
long-term results and fewer people
on the streets.
Figure 1.5 Sleeping rough in Melbourne
HoMie launched a range of upcycled garments in 2020 under its sub-brand REBORN. One product
is an upcycled bomber jacket that led to the brand winning a Victorian Premier’s Design Award.
Another development is the recent partnering with US streetwear brand Champion, which has
resulted in both brands’ logos appearing in a custom-embroidered design.
In 2019–20, HoMie’s revenue was approximately $1.3 million, with 60 per cent coming from sales
and 40 per cent from philanthropic contributions. It also received a small contribution from the
federal government.
HoMie believes ‘that homelessness is a situation you can move out of with the right opportunity,
support, and employment’.

Social enterprises need to be recognised for their important contribution to the economy of
Australia in terms of making it more equitable, stable and sustainable. Social enterprises are driven
by an economic, social, cultural or environmental mission to benefit the community. They aim to
address social issues, such as homelessness or social exclusion, reducing environmental impact
through recycling, or creating responsibly sourced and produced products and services.

Government business enterprises
A government business enterprise (GBE) operates in the public sector of the Australian
economy. The Australian Government, the six state governments and the two territory
governments have established businesses that operate by adopting a corporate (company)
model. The relationship of the GBEs is similar to that of a holding company and its subsidiaries.
The various governments act as the shareholders for the GBEs and have a strong interest in their
performance and financial returns. The management of a GBE has autonomy over the running
of the business; however, this must be balanced with their regular reporting requirements
to the shareholders and ultimately to parliament and the public. GBEs provide essential
community services, such as communications (Australia Post), telecommunications (National
Broadband Network), housing (Defence Housing Australia), transport (Australian Rail Track
Corporation), energy security (Snowy Hydro), and employment and health services. There are
three characteristics that identify GBEs:
1 The government (federal, state or territory) controls the business.
2 The business is principally engaged in commercial activities.
3 The business has a legal personality separate to a department of government.

Business objectives
Learning intentions –
at the end of this
chapter section I will
be able to:
1.2.1 Identify, define and describe specific listed business
objectives
1.2.2 Apply specific listed business objectives to practical
and/or simulated business solutions
All businesses must establish aims or objectives. These provide an overall or overarching goal,
which can then be translated into action by using strategies. Objectives are statements of
desired achievement and provide the direction for the business and subsequent actions. All
businesses, whether they are small, medium or large, need to establish clear objectives if they
are to succeed.
objectives
statements
of desired
achievement that
provide direction
for the business
Businesses need to put in place multiple objectives that are operational, making use of
resources and efforts, while being convertible into specific strategies, targets and outcomes.
Objectives cover a wide range of areas relating to making a profit, increasing market share,
meeting shareholder expectations and fulfilling the needs of both the market and society.
Other important objectives include improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the business
operations. Objectives are also developed to meet the interests of other stakeholders and
for the provision of goods and services within the limitations of the business’s resources and
budget constraints.
Objectives should be set using the SMART principle.
SMART stands for:
•
•
•
•
•
Specific – the objectives are set and are explicit
Measurable – the outcome and objective can be measured
Attainable/Achievable – the objective is one that can be reached
Realistic/Relevant – objectives are goals that can be reached within the time frame
Timely/Time-bound – the objectives will be reached within a certain period of time.
SMART
objectives or
goals are specific,
measurable,
attainable or
achievable,
relevant or
realistic, and
timely or time-
bound
By adopting the SMART principle, businesses are clear about what they would like to achieve
and aim for.
ACTIVITY 1.4
Evaluate whether the following statements meet the SMART test:
1 Nicole has recently moved from working in the city to a country town to experience a
change in lifestyle. She plans to open a garden nursery business next year and aims to
achieve a 60 per cent market share within two years of commencing operations.
2 Mohammad, who has worked for 10 years for an IT software business in the CBD, has
decided to start up a small IT software business operating from his home office. He would
like the business to make a small profit within four years.
3 Hawa is in Year 12 and would like to gain a high enough ATAR to be offered a place in an
Event Management course at the local university. She is studying four hours every night
and has received high marks for the work she has completed so far.

20 Unit 3 | Managing a business
Objectives influence and direct all levels of a business. There is a hierarchy of objectives, and this
includes:
vision statement
a statement that
outlines the
aspirations and
values of the
business
mission
statement a
statement that
defines what the
business wants to
achieve now
values statement
a statement that
outlines what
the organisation
sees as its
corporate values
and centres on
integrity, honesty
and ethical
behaviour
1 The vision statement and mission statement express the purpose and reason the business
exists and what it aspires to in the future. Virgin Australia, which operates an extensive
network of domestic and international services from its base in Brisbane, states its vision as
being ‘to revolutionise air travel again, this time across all market segments. We will do this
by providing a seamless experience across all international and domestic markets, while
retaining the same excellent service’ (Virgin Australia website). The vision statement outlines
the values of the business and relates to key groups, including shareholders, employees and
customers. Some businesses also produce a values statement, which outlines a business’s
corporate values and cultural priorities. These are usually set by the board of directors or
senior managers and reflect the direction and objectives of the business.
2 Corporate and strategic objectives establish the goals for the rest of the business. Corporate
objectives set the strategic direction (usually long-term, two to five years), and the
departmental objectives (tactical objectives) are set for the next one to two years. Finally,
operational objectives (for a period of less than one year) are set by teams and individuals
within departments.
All of the objectives align to achieve the goals of the business.
ACTIVITY 1.5
1 Explain the difference between a vision statement, a mission statement and a values
statement.
2 Identify the importance for a business of developing a mission statement and a vision
statement.
3 Evaluate the importance of developing a values statement.

To make a profit
Profit, being the difference between revenue and expenses, is regarded as the lifeblood or
primary objective of a business. Profits must be earned to ensure the survival of the business
(both short-term and long-term), its growth and its expansion over time. To make a profit is a
financial objective and relates directly to the desired financial performance of the business.
Usually, a certain level of profit will be determined as acceptable by the business (in terms of its
objectives and the expectations of investors and other institutions).
Many businesses in Australia are part of the private sector and have been established to make
a profit. Reducing the operational costs for a business is one strategy that a business can adopt
to achieve a financial objective ‘to make a profit’. A variety of strategies can then be put in place
to achieve this objective, such as reducing costs associated with providing a product or service.
Other businesses may adopt a strategy, similar to Woolworths’, to transform their business with
the expectation of increasing their level of profit.
market share
proportion or
percentage of the
market (and total
sales) controlled
by the business
To increase market share
Market share is the proportion or percentage of the market (and total sales) controlled by the
business. When a business sets the objective of increasing its market share, it is aiming at gaining a
greater percentage of the market through its sales, resulting in an increased revenue stream.
Businesses produce goods and services. If there is not a demand or need for the product or
service, the business is unlikely to achieve this objective. Many businesses, regardless of their
size, will strive to maximise the appeal of their product or service and to increase market share
wherever possible. Recognising a niche in the market is vital, and many small and medium
businesses do this very well.

efficiency the best
use of resources
in the production
of goods and/or
services
To improve efficiency
Efficiency relates to the best use of resources in the production of goods and/or services.
To achieve an improvement in efficiency, the business needs to achieve more output (goods
produced or services provided) for each unit of input, often referred to as productivity levels.
In the quest to improve efficiency, a business should review and evaluate all its operations to
determine whether improvements can be achieved without leading to additional costs to the
business. A business must work within the constraints of its finances and budgets, as this is an
essential element to business success.
effectiveness
the degree to
which a process
or system is
successful in
achievement
of business
objectives
To improve effectiveness
Effectiveness relates to the degree to which a business achieves its stated objectives – ‘doing
the right things’, which will ultimately yield positive results for the business. To achieve its stated
objectives, the business must ensure that it has in place strategies related directly to those
specific objectives, and measurement tools to assess whether the outcome meets the stated
objective.
For example, if a retail business establishes an objective of increasing market share, it may
decide to purchase new technology to reduce customer handling time at the checkout. The
staff are trained in the new equipment; however, a review of monthly sales data does not reveal
an increase in sales revenue. Feedback from customers also reveals that they feel the use of this
new technology is impersonal and detracts from their shopping experience. If, following the
implementation of the new technology, market share does not increase, the outcome would be
judged as not being achieved and the strategy would be considered ineffective.
market set
of actual or
potential buyers
of a product or
service
To fulfil a market need
It is important for a business to recognise and satisfy the needs of its market, which is the set
of actual or potential buyers of a product or service. The market could be one that is physical,
social or individual. The physical market relates to providing food, clothing, shelter and safety.
The social market relates to satisfying the
need for belonging and affection. The needs
of the individual market relate to gaining
knowledge and allowing for self-expression.
Figure 1.12 A woman selling fruits and vegetables at a produce stand, fulfilling
physical market needs.
For a business, satisfying the needs of its
market is an easy way to increase profits
and sell more products and services. Its
objectives may be to expand a current
product or service into a new market or
to create a new product to meet the need
of an existing or new market. Strategies
would need to be put in place to fulfil the
different needs to get the consumer to
purchase the business’s product or use
its service. A business not only needs to
identify its market, but also needs to assess
the potential size of the market and identify
which part of the market to concentrate on.

who live together on their rural property in
Gunning, New South Wales, commenced the
business after they identified a gap in the
children’s clothing market.
bears and safari animals. Why was this, when
Australia has the most amazing animals that
deserve to be celebrated and worn with pride?
Both Ellen and Jess have a background in
illustration and printmaking and are keenly
interested in nature and animals. Bandicute
started partially from a creative itch they
needed to scratch, and a gap in the market that
they discovered after Jess’s two daughters,
Lilly and Hannah, were born. They noticed
many baby and children’s clothing items with
designs featuring foxes, rabbits, deer, raccoons,
Bandicute specialises in creating and
manufacturing unisex, quality, modern,
colourful designs featuring many favourite
Aussie icons. Functionality and style are at
the core of every decision made. Bandicute’s
garments are designed to be long-lasting and
versatile, so you can get as much wear out
of them as possible and hand them down to
future siblings and beyond.

CASE STUDY ANALYSIS
1 Identify and describe the ‘market need’ that the creators of Bandicute believed they would
fulfil and work towards creating a profitable business.
2
Discuss which is the more important factor when buying clothing: ‘functionality and style’
or price.
To fulfil a social need
Social objectives relate to the role of a business in the community. They go beyond the
financial objectives and revolve around the business as a ‘good citizen’. Social objectives may
relate to a number of different areas, such as the provision of community services and facilities;
contribution to community causes at the local, state, national or world level; providing local job
opportunities; or focusing on the environment by minimising waste and recycling.

Businesses can also promote social objectives through the policies and practices within the
workplace. These can include equal opportunity policies, anti-bullying policies, equity in the
workplace, and targeted employment programs that exceed their legal obligations.

ACTIVITY 1.7
Investigate a local business that has put in place some type of community program/s or that
supports a local sporting or other club. Share your example with other members of your class.
To meet shareholder expectations
Shareholders are the owners of a company and are also stakeholders in that business.
Individuals may own the entire company, or through buying shares be involved in the
ownership, based on the number of shares they own, of either private or public companies.
All shareholders expect the business they have invested in to be successful. Shareholders also
expect the business to make a profit, for any shares purchased to increase in value, and for
dividends to be paid. Shareholders can pressure a business, regardless of size, to make certain
decisions and can therefore influence the strategic objectives and direction of the business.
The pressure may be in the form of wanting the business to become more sustainable in its
operations. While this may incur a short-term expense for the business, it has also been shown
that it can contribute to greater profitability in the long term and therefore increased financial
returns for shareholders.

AVOID: Application, inference, or synthesis. Test recognition, not deeper understanding.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can distinguish between vision statements, mission statements and values statements
CODE: 1.2

WHAT (concept explanation):
A vision statement outlines what the business aspires to be in the future. A mission statement defines what the business wants to achieve now. A values statement outlines the organisation's corporate values, centring on integrity, honesty and ethical behaviour.

WHY (importance):
These statements provide the overarching direction from which specific business objectives are developed and aligned.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Virgin Australia's vision is 'to revolutionise air travel again, this time across all market segments'. Its mission focuses on providing seamless experiences across domestic and international markets.

SUBTOPIC: Financial and Market Objectives
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the objectives of making a profit, increasing market share and fulfilling a market need, as well as the SMART principle for setting effective objectives and the role of vision, mission and values statements.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Financial and market objectives drive strategic decisions in business. Understanding how to set, apply and evaluate these objectives is essential for analysing real and simulated business scenarios.

Businesses in Australia
The way a business is run and the role of the owner(s) varies depending on how those owners
wish to be involved and the various legal implications of different forms of ownership and legal
structure.
Australia operates as a mixed market economy where ownership of resources, property and
factors of production are shared between private individuals and governments. The majority
of businesses are owned by private individuals, groups or institutions, and these are classified
as being in the private sector. There are, however, a significant number of government-owned
businesses that are classified as being in the public sector.
Businesses are integral to the successful functioning of the domestic (Australian) and global
economy. They are important because they:
•
manufacture and sell goods and/or provide services to consumers either in Australia and/or
•
•
•
•
globally
create employment
provide taxation income to the government directly from their earnings
are an important source of innovation and product development
provide infrastructure.

Sole trader
If an individual wants to establish or run a business, becoming a sole trader is the simplest and
most inexpensive form of business structure. It involves a single owner operating a business
under either their own name or a Registered Business Name (RBN). The sole trader assumes
total responsibility for the major decisions of the business relating to planning and operations.
They have the sole right to all profits and capital of the business.
However, in the event of the business incurring losses or debts, the sole trader as the owner is
held totally legally responsible for all debts of the business (unlimited liability). This means
that the owner’s personal assets can be seized to recover a debt. The business may operate
using the personal bank account and tax file number (TFN) of the owner; however, there
is a requirement that the financial records of the business must be retained for at least five
years. A sole trader may employ people to help them run the business. If they choose to do
this, there are several compulsory obligations that must be complied with, including making
superannuation contributions on behalf of employees and obtaining workers’ compensation
insurance. Sole traders are recommended to apply for an RBN as a form of protection for their
business identity and to give their business legitimacy.
Many businesses initially set up as sole traders then progress to other forms of business
structure.

ACTIVITY 1.1
Simon had been working as a pastry chef with a busy restaurant in the city prior to the COVID-19
pandemic. The restaurant decided that due to the numerous lockdowns that had occurred in
Melbourne it would have to close. Simon had created a good reputation for himself, especially
for his pastries and desserts, and was often appearing on reviews on Instagram posted by diners
at the restaurant. Simon decided to try operating a cooking business from his home. Although
known as a good pastry chef, Simon knew nothing about running a business and the type of
business structure he should set up. A friend had suggested that he should become a sole trader.

2 Analyse for Simon what would be the advantages and disadvantages of adopting this form
of business structure for his new catering venture.
Partnership
A business partnership combines the expertise and resources of between two and 20 people
going into business together. Each partner is jointly liable for business debts incurred (unlimited
liability).

There are two types of business partnership:
•
•
general partnership – all partners are deemed equally responsible for management of the
business. Each has unlimited liability for debts and obligations.
limited partnership – liability of one or more partners is limited. These partners (passive
investors) are not involved in day-to-day business operations. Liability is limited in
proportion to the amount invested.
The Partnership Act 1958 (Vic) sets out the rights and duties of the persons involved in
a partnership. Most partnerships are based on a formal legal agreement (partnership
agreement) being entered into by the parties.

Company
Many business owners opt to establish a separate legal entity, being a company, which is
achieved through the process of incorporation. Prior to the company being formed, the business
owners should undertake a name availability search to check whether the name they would like
is available or whether it has already been allocated to another company. The Business Names
Registration Act 2011 sets out words that may not be included in a company name. The company
needs to be formed according to legislation, the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act), and is
then registered with the
Australian Securities and
Investments Commission
(ASIC). An Australian
Company Number (ACN)
must be obtained, and
this number must be
placed on every public
document of the business.
In addition, the business
must designate a registered

Private limited company
A private limited company is easily recognised by its name, as it includes the words ‘Proprietary
Limited’, which are often shortened to ‘Pty Ltd’, at the end of the name. This classification works
to place some restrictions on how this type of company operates:
•
•
•
•
shareholders – the company has a minimum of one shareholder and is restricted to a
maximum of 50 non-employee shareholders
shares – can only be traded with the permission of other shareholders, which must be given
before any transaction takes place
directors – at least one (who lives in Australia)
company secretary – optional.

This form of company is popular with businesses that have previously operated as sole traders
or partnerships but would now like to expand, while also gaining the protection that comes
from creating a separate legal entity and limiting their liability for debts incurred by the
business. It is also a favoured business structure for family businesses wanting to create an
ongoing business structure for future generations of the family.

ACTIVITY 1.2
Barry and his family run a red gum furniture manufacturing business in country Victoria. They
make large items of furniture, such as tables, chairs, sideboards and bookshelves, with the offcuts
of wood being made into chopping boards and bowls. Established initially by Barry as a family
partnership with his two sons, the business now employs five other craftspeople in the factory
to help them keep up with orders. The sales showroom is in the main street of the town and is
very popular with both locals and tourists. Barry does not feel comfortable dealing directly with
customers, preferring to leave the sales negotiations to his five sales staff. Some of the family
members have expressed a desire that the business now change from being a partnership to
become a private limited company.
Barry would like your advice as to the advantages and disadvantages of changing the structure of
the business from a partnership to a private limited company. What would you propose?
Public listed company
As businesses grow in the size of their operations, they may look to the option of becoming a
public company as a means of increasing their number of shares and access to more capital.
To do this the business needs to issue a prospectus, which is a formal document inviting the
public to purchase its shares. A public company does not have any upper limit restrictions
placed on it as to its number of shareholders. Once listed on the Australian Securities
Exchange (ASX), the shares in the company can be openly traded, with the price of the shares

being dependent upon the value perceived by the marketplace. These companies can be
recognised by the word ‘Limited’ (Ltd) after their name, which shows that they offer limited
liability to their shareholders.
There are some restrictions on how this type of company operates:

Social enterprises
A social enterprise is a type of business that uses strategies to maximise improvements
in human wellbeing or the environment, rather than to maximise profits for its social
entrepreneur owners or shareholders. Whether they are structured as ‘for-profit’ or ‘not-for-
profit’ entities, social enterprises have two main goals: to achieve social, cultural, community
or environmental outcomes, and to earn revenue. Social enterprises are innovative
and sustainable.
Social enterprises are run like a business, as they produce goods or services to sell, but redirect
the surplus in pursuit of social or environmental goals. In other words, a social enterprise aims
to make a profit in order to help solve a social or environmental problem. The majority of
social enterprises adopt the legal structure of a company. To assist them in the management
of their business, the social entrepreneurs behind the business will seek to appoint directors
to their boards who are specialists in key areas, including community development, business,
vocational training, law and accountancy.
It is estimated that there are in excess of 20 000 social enterprises operating across every
industry within the Australian economy. The majority operate as small businesses (73%) and
target their business activities towards assisting people with disability (35%), young people (33%)ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

and disadvantaged women (28%). In Victoria, 1.8 per cent of the state’s workforce (i.e. 60 000 jobs)
is created by social enterprises, contributing $5.2 billion to the Victorian economy (Source: CSI
Swinburne).
Social enterprises are encouraged (if possible) to obtain Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status
from the Australian Taxation Office, making all donations above $2 to their enterprise fully tax
deductible. This enables them to offer donors the additional advantage of being able to claim
that donation off their taxation, so reducing the donor’s tax liability.
Many social entrepreneurs have great ideas and a social conscience but need some extra
assistance and support to make their enterprise viable and investment-ready. Two groups are
prominent in meeting this need. Social Traders is a not-for-profit organisation formed in 2008
with the purpose of supporting and encouraging the establishment of commercially viable
social enterprises throughout Australia. The Alliance of Social Enterprise Networks Australia
represents seven social enterprise networks in each state and territory.

Social enterprises:
HoMie (Homelessness
of Melbourne
Incorporated
Enterprise)
The idea behind HoMie began in 2013 after a
group of friends (Marcus Crook, Nick Pearce
and Robbie Gillies) talked to people living on
the streets. They then shared these stories
via their Facebook page ‘Homelessness of
Melbourne’, created to connect with people
experiencing homelessness, thus giving them a
platform to be heard and understood.
and make donating easier through innovative
platforms.
In mid-2016, HoMie opened a permanent
shopfront in Fitzroy where it began selling its
own T-shirts, sweatpants and tops that were
made in ethically accredited factories in China.
Marcus and Nick established this social
enterprise in 2015 with its primary mission
to provide pathways out of homelessness.
HoMie places importance on the following
values: inclusivity, connection, respect and
transparency in all its actions. It does this
by providing new clothing, training and
job opportunities to people experiencing
homelessness. Its other goals are to
change negative public attitudes towards
homelessness, mobilise human compassion
Over time, HoMie has grown to now running
two social impact programs. One of these is VIP
Shopping days, when it closes the shop to the
public one day a month, so people affected by
homelessness can come and select five items
of clothing and enjoy both a free haircut and
lunch. The other program is the HoMie Pathway
Alliance Program. Since its inception in 2017,
this program has expanded and now partners
with Cotton On, the Hanes Group (Champion
and Bonds) and the Retail Prodigy Group (Nike
and TOMS) to provide training (both on-the-job

and employment opportunities
for homeless people. After paying
staff wages, shop rent and paying
for their products to be made,
100 per cent of the profits goes
towards providing pathways out of
homelessness. It’s not just about
shelter, but empowering people to
learn, make social connections and
become self-sufficient. This is HoMie’s
long-term goal, because it leads to
long-term results and fewer people
on the streets.
Figure 1.5 Sleeping rough in Melbourne
HoMie launched a range of upcycled garments in 2020 under its sub-brand REBORN. One product
is an upcycled bomber jacket that led to the brand winning a Victorian Premier’s Design Award.
Another development is the recent partnering with US streetwear brand Champion, which has
resulted in both brands’ logos appearing in a custom-embroidered design.
In 2019–20, HoMie’s revenue was approximately $1.3 million, with 60 per cent coming from sales
and 40 per cent from philanthropic contributions. It also received a small contribution from the
federal government.
HoMie believes ‘that homelessness is a situation you can move out of with the right opportunity,
support, and employment’.

Social enterprises need to be recognised for their important contribution to the economy of
Australia in terms of making it more equitable, stable and sustainable. Social enterprises are driven
by an economic, social, cultural or environmental mission to benefit the community. They aim to
address social issues, such as homelessness or social exclusion, reducing environmental impact
through recycling, or creating responsibly sourced and produced products and services.

Government business enterprises
A government business enterprise (GBE) operates in the public sector of the Australian
economy. The Australian Government, the six state governments and the two territory
governments have established businesses that operate by adopting a corporate (company)
model. The relationship of the GBEs is similar to that of a holding company and its subsidiaries.
The various governments act as the shareholders for the GBEs and have a strong interest in their
performance and financial returns. The management of a GBE has autonomy over the running
of the business; however, this must be balanced with their regular reporting requirements
to the shareholders and ultimately to parliament and the public. GBEs provide essential
community services, such as communications (Australia Post), telecommunications (National
Broadband Network), housing (Defence Housing Australia), transport (Australian Rail Track
Corporation), energy security (Snowy Hydro), and employment and health services. There are
three characteristics that identify GBEs:
1 The government (federal, state or territory) controls the business.
2 The business is principally engaged in commercial activities.
3 The business has a legal personality separate to a department of government.

Business objectives
Learning intentions –
at the end of this
chapter section I will
be able to:
1.2.1 Identify, define and describe specific listed business
objectives
1.2.2 Apply specific listed business objectives to practical
and/or simulated business solutions
All businesses must establish aims or objectives. These provide an overall or overarching goal,
which can then be translated into action by using strategies. Objectives are statements of
desired achievement and provide the direction for the business and subsequent actions. All
businesses, whether they are small, medium or large, need to establish clear objectives if they
are to succeed.
objectives
statements
of desired
achievement that
provide direction
for the business
Businesses need to put in place multiple objectives that are operational, making use of
resources and efforts, while being convertible into specific strategies, targets and outcomes.
Objectives cover a wide range of areas relating to making a profit, increasing market share,
meeting shareholder expectations and fulfilling the needs of both the market and society.
Other important objectives include improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the business
operations. Objectives are also developed to meet the interests of other stakeholders and
for the provision of goods and services within the limitations of the business’s resources and
budget constraints.
Objectives should be set using the SMART principle.
SMART stands for:
•
•
•
•
•
Specific – the objectives are set and are explicit
Measurable – the outcome and objective can be measured
Attainable/Achievable – the objective is one that can be reached
Realistic/Relevant – objectives are goals that can be reached within the time frame
Timely/Time-bound – the objectives will be reached within a certain period of time.
SMART
objectives or
goals are specific,
measurable,
attainable or
achievable,
relevant or
realistic, and
timely or time-
bound
By adopting the SMART principle, businesses are clear about what they would like to achieve
and aim for.
ACTIVITY 1.4
Evaluate whether the following statements meet the SMART test:
1 Nicole has recently moved from working in the city to a country town to experience a
change in lifestyle. She plans to open a garden nursery business next year and aims to
achieve a 60 per cent market share within two years of commencing operations.
2 Mohammad, who has worked for 10 years for an IT software business in the CBD, has
decided to start up a small IT software business operating from his home office. He would
like the business to make a small profit within four years.
3 Hawa is in Year 12 and would like to gain a high enough ATAR to be offered a place in an
Event Management course at the local university. She is studying four hours every night
and has received high marks for the work she has completed so far.

20 Unit 3 | Managing a business
Objectives influence and direct all levels of a business. There is a hierarchy of objectives, and this
includes:
vision statement
a statement that
outlines the
aspirations and
values of the
business
mission
statement a
statement that
defines what the
business wants to
achieve now
values statement
a statement that
outlines what
the organisation
sees as its
corporate values
and centres on
integrity, honesty
and ethical
behaviour
1 The vision statement and mission statement express the purpose and reason the business
exists and what it aspires to in the future. Virgin Australia, which operates an extensive
network of domestic and international services from its base in Brisbane, states its vision as
being ‘to revolutionise air travel again, this time across all market segments. We will do this
by providing a seamless experience across all international and domestic markets, while
retaining the same excellent service’ (Virgin Australia website). The vision statement outlines
the values of the business and relates to key groups, including shareholders, employees and
customers. Some businesses also produce a values statement, which outlines a business’s
corporate values and cultural priorities. These are usually set by the board of directors or
senior managers and reflect the direction and objectives of the business.
2 Corporate and strategic objectives establish the goals for the rest of the business. Corporate
objectives set the strategic direction (usually long-term, two to five years), and the
departmental objectives (tactical objectives) are set for the next one to two years. Finally,
operational objectives (for a period of less than one year) are set by teams and individuals
within departments.
All of the objectives align to achieve the goals of the business.
ACTIVITY 1.5
1 Explain the difference between a vision statement, a mission statement and a values
statement.
2 Identify the importance for a business of developing a mission statement and a vision
statement.
3 Evaluate the importance of developing a values statement.

To make a profit
Profit, being the difference between revenue and expenses, is regarded as the lifeblood or
primary objective of a business. Profits must be earned to ensure the survival of the business
(both short-term and long-term), its growth and its expansion over time. To make a profit is a
financial objective and relates directly to the desired financial performance of the business.
Usually, a certain level of profit will be determined as acceptable by the business (in terms of its
objectives and the expectations of investors and other institutions).
Many businesses in Australia are part of the private sector and have been established to make
a profit. Reducing the operational costs for a business is one strategy that a business can adopt
to achieve a financial objective ‘to make a profit’. A variety of strategies can then be put in place
to achieve this objective, such as reducing costs associated with providing a product or service.
Other businesses may adopt a strategy, similar to Woolworths’, to transform their business with
the expectation of increasing their level of profit.
market share
proportion or
percentage of the
market (and total
sales) controlled
by the business
To increase market share
Market share is the proportion or percentage of the market (and total sales) controlled by the
business. When a business sets the objective of increasing its market share, it is aiming at gaining a
greater percentage of the market through its sales, resulting in an increased revenue stream.
Businesses produce goods and services. If there is not a demand or need for the product or
service, the business is unlikely to achieve this objective. Many businesses, regardless of their
size, will strive to maximise the appeal of their product or service and to increase market share
wherever possible. Recognising a niche in the market is vital, and many small and medium
businesses do this very well.

efficiency the best
use of resources
in the production
of goods and/or
services
To improve efficiency
Efficiency relates to the best use of resources in the production of goods and/or services.
To achieve an improvement in efficiency, the business needs to achieve more output (goods
produced or services provided) for each unit of input, often referred to as productivity levels.
In the quest to improve efficiency, a business should review and evaluate all its operations to
determine whether improvements can be achieved without leading to additional costs to the
business. A business must work within the constraints of its finances and budgets, as this is an
essential element to business success.
effectiveness
the degree to
which a process
or system is
successful in
achievement
of business
objectives
To improve effectiveness
Effectiveness relates to the degree to which a business achieves its stated objectives – ‘doing
the right things’, which will ultimately yield positive results for the business. To achieve its stated
objectives, the business must ensure that it has in place strategies related directly to those
specific objectives, and measurement tools to assess whether the outcome meets the stated
objective.
For example, if a retail business establishes an objective of increasing market share, it may
decide to purchase new technology to reduce customer handling time at the checkout. The
staff are trained in the new equipment; however, a review of monthly sales data does not reveal
an increase in sales revenue. Feedback from customers also reveals that they feel the use of this
new technology is impersonal and detracts from their shopping experience. If, following the
implementation of the new technology, market share does not increase, the outcome would be
judged as not being achieved and the strategy would be considered ineffective.
market set
of actual or
potential buyers
of a product or
service
To fulfil a market need
It is important for a business to recognise and satisfy the needs of its market, which is the set
of actual or potential buyers of a product or service. The market could be one that is physical,
social or individual. The physical market relates to providing food, clothing, shelter and safety.
The social market relates to satisfying the
need for belonging and affection. The needs
of the individual market relate to gaining
knowledge and allowing for self-expression.
Figure 1.12 A woman selling fruits and vegetables at a produce stand, fulfilling
physical market needs.
For a business, satisfying the needs of its
market is an easy way to increase profits
and sell more products and services. Its
objectives may be to expand a current
product or service into a new market or
to create a new product to meet the need
of an existing or new market. Strategies
would need to be put in place to fulfil the
different needs to get the consumer to
purchase the business’s product or use
its service. A business not only needs to
identify its market, but also needs to assess
the potential size of the market and identify
which part of the market to concentrate on.

Australia has the most amazing animals that
deserve to be celebrated and worn with pride?
Both Ellen and Jess have a background in
illustration and printmaking and are keenly
interested in nature and animals. Bandicute
started partially from a creative itch they
needed to scratch, and a gap in the market that
they discovered after Jess’s two daughters,
Lilly and Hannah, were born. They noticed
many baby and children’s clothing items with
designs featuring foxes, rabbits, deer, raccoons,
Bandicute specialises in creating and
manufacturing unisex, quality, modern,
colourful designs featuring many favourite
Aussie icons. Functionality and style are at
the core of every decision made. Bandicute’s
garments are designed to be long-lasting and

fulfil and work towards creating a profitable business.
2
Discuss which is the more important factor when buying clothing: ‘functionality and style’
or price.
To fulfil a social need
Social objectives relate to the role of a business in the community. They go beyond the
financial objectives and revolve around the business as a ‘good citizen’. Social objectives may
relate to a number of different areas, such as the provision of community services and facilities;
contribution to community causes at the local, state, national or world level; providing local job
opportunities; or focusing on the environment by minimising waste and recycling.

ACTIVITY 1.7
Investigate a local business that has put in place some type of community program/s or that
supports a local sporting or other club. Share your example with other members of your class.
To meet shareholder expectations
Shareholders are the owners of a company and are also stakeholders in that business.
Individuals may own the entire company, or through buying shares be involved in the
ownership, based on the number of shares they own, of either private or public companies.
All shareholders expect the business they have invested in to be successful. Shareholders also
expect the business to make a profit, for any shares purchased to increase in value, and for
dividends to be paid. Shareholders can pressure a business, regardless of size, to make certain
decisions and can therefore influence the strategic objectives and direction of the business.
The pressure may be in the form of wanting the business to become more sustainable in its
operations. While this may incur a short-term expense for the business, it has also been shown
that it can contribute to greater profitability in the long term and therefore increased financial
returns for shareholders.

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can distinguish between vision statements, mission statements and values statements
CODE: 1.2

WHAT (concept explanation):
A vision statement outlines what the business aspires to be in the future. A mission statement defines what the business wants to achieve now. A values statement outlines the organisation's corporate values, centring on integrity, honesty and ethical behaviour.

WHY (importance):
These statements provide the overarching direction from which specific business objectives are developed and aligned.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Virgin Australia's vision is 'to revolutionise air travel again, this time across all market segments'. Its mission focuses on providing seamless experiences across domestic and international markets.

SUBTOPIC: Financial and Market Objectives
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the objectives of making a profit, increasing market share and fulfilling a market need, as well as the SMART principle for setting effective objectives and the role of vision, mission and values statements.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Financial and market objectives drive strategic decisions in business. Understanding how to set, apply and evaluate these objectives is essential for analysing real and simulated business scenarios.

Businesses in Australia
The way a business is run and the role of the owner(s) varies depending on how those owners
wish to be involved and the various legal implications of different forms of ownership and legal
structure.
Australia operates as a mixed market economy where ownership of resources, property and
factors of production are shared between private individuals and governments. The majority
of businesses are owned by private individuals, groups or institutions, and these are classified
as being in the private sector. There are, however, a significant number of government-owned
businesses that are classified as being in the public sector.
Businesses are integral to the successful functioning of the domestic (Australian) and global
economy. They are important because they:
•
manufacture and sell goods and/or provide services to consumers either in Australia and/or
•
•
•
•
globally
create employment
provide taxation income to the government directly from their earnings
are an important source of innovation and product development
provide infrastructure.

Sole trader
If an individual wants to establish or run a business, becoming a sole trader is the simplest and
most inexpensive form of business structure. It involves a single owner operating a business
under either their own name or a Registered Business Name (RBN). The sole trader assumes
total responsibility for the major decisions of the business relating to planning and operations.
They have the sole right to all profits and capital of the business.
However, in the event of the business incurring losses or debts, the sole trader as the owner is
held totally legally responsible for all debts of the business (unlimited liability). This means
that the owner’s personal assets can be seized to recover a debt. The business may operate
using the personal bank account and tax file number (TFN) of the owner; however, there
is a requirement that the financial records of the business must be retained for at least five
years. A sole trader may employ people to help them run the business. If they choose to do
this, there are several compulsory obligations that must be complied with, including making
superannuation contributions on behalf of employees and obtaining workers’ compensation
insurance. Sole traders are recommended to apply for an RBN as a form of protection for their
business identity and to give their business legitimacy.
Many businesses initially set up as sole traders then progress to other forms of business
structure.

ACTIVITY 1.1
Simon had been working as a pastry chef with a busy restaurant in the city prior to the COVID-19
pandemic. The restaurant decided that due to the numerous lockdowns that had occurred in
Melbourne it would have to close. Simon had created a good reputation for himself, especially
for his pastries and desserts, and was often appearing on reviews on Instagram posted by diners
at the restaurant. Simon decided to try operating a cooking business from his home. Although
known as a good pastry chef, Simon knew nothing about running a business and the type of
business structure he should set up. A friend had suggested that he should become a sole trader.
1 Outline for Simon what it means to be a sole trader.
2 Analyse for Simon what would be the advantages and disadvantages of adopting this form
of business structure for his new catering venture.
Partnership
A business partnership combines the expertise and resources of between two and 20 people
going into business together. Each partner is jointly liable for business debts incurred (unlimited
liability).

There are two types of business partnership:
•
•
general partnership – all partners are deemed equally responsible for management of the
business. Each has unlimited liability for debts and obligations.
limited partnership – liability of one or more partners is limited. These partners (passive
investors) are not involved in day-to-day business operations. Liability is limited in
proportion to the amount invested.
The Partnership Act 1958 (Vic) sets out the rights and duties of the persons involved in
a partnership. Most partnerships are based on a formal legal agreement (partnership
agreement) being entered into by the parties.

Company
Many business owners opt to establish a separate legal entity, being a company, which is
achieved through the process of incorporation. Prior to the company being formed, the business
owners should undertake a name availability search to check whether the name they would like
is available or whether it has already been allocated to another company. The Business Names
Registration Act 2011 sets out words that may not be included in a company name. The company
needs to be formed according to legislation, the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act), and is
then registered with the
Australian Securities and
Investments Commission
(ASIC). An Australian
Company Number (ACN)
must be obtained, and
this number must be
placed on every public
document of the business.
In addition, the business
must designate a registered
office. A company has a

Private limited company
A private limited company is easily recognised by its name, as it includes the words ‘Proprietary
Limited’, which are often shortened to ‘Pty Ltd’, at the end of the name. This classification works
to place some restrictions on how this type of company operates:
•
•
•
•
shareholders – the company has a minimum of one shareholder and is restricted to a
maximum of 50 non-employee shareholders
shares – can only be traded with the permission of other shareholders, which must be given
before any transaction takes place
directors – at least one (who lives in Australia)
company secretary – optional.

This form of company is popular with businesses that have previously operated as sole traders
or partnerships but would now like to expand, while also gaining the protection that comes
from creating a separate legal entity and limiting their liability for debts incurred by the
business. It is also a favoured business structure for family businesses wanting to create an
ongoing business structure for future generations of the family.

ACTIVITY 1.2
Barry and his family run a red gum furniture manufacturing business in country Victoria. They
make large items of furniture, such as tables, chairs, sideboards and bookshelves, with the offcuts
of wood being made into chopping boards and bowls. Established initially by Barry as a family
partnership with his two sons, the business now employs five other craftspeople in the factory
to help them keep up with orders. The sales showroom is in the main street of the town and is
very popular with both locals and tourists. Barry does not feel comfortable dealing directly with
customers, preferring to leave the sales negotiations to his five sales staff. Some of the family
members have expressed a desire that the business now change from being a partnership to
become a private limited company.
Barry would like your advice as to the advantages and disadvantages of changing the structure of
the business from a partnership to a private limited company. What would you propose?
Public listed company
As businesses grow in the size of their operations, they may look to the option of becoming a
public company as a means of increasing their number of shares and access to more capital.
To do this the business needs to issue a prospectus, which is a formal document inviting the
public to purchase its shares. A public company does not have any upper limit restrictions
placed on it as to its number of shareholders. Once listed on the Australian Securities
Exchange (ASX), the shares in the company can be openly traded, with the price of the shares

being dependent upon the value perceived by the marketplace. These companies can be
recognised by the word ‘Limited’ (Ltd) after their name, which shows that they offer limited
liability to their shareholders.
There are some restrictions on how this type of company operates:

Social enterprises
A social enterprise is a type of business that uses strategies to maximise improvements
in human wellbeing or the environment, rather than to maximise profits for its social
entrepreneur owners or shareholders. Whether they are structured as ‘for-profit’ or ‘not-for-
profit’ entities, social enterprises have two main goals: to achieve social, cultural, community
or environmental outcomes, and to earn revenue. Social enterprises are innovative
and sustainable.
Social enterprises are run like a business, as they produce goods or services to sell, but redirect
the surplus in pursuit of social or environmental goals. In other words, a social enterprise aims
to make a profit in order to help solve a social or environmental problem. The majority of
social enterprises adopt the legal structure of a company. To assist them in the management
of their business, the social entrepreneurs behind the business will seek to appoint directors
to their boards who are specialists in key areas, including community development, business,
vocational training, law and accountancy.
It is estimated that there are in excess of 20 000 social enterprises operating across every
industry within the Australian economy. The majority operate as small businesses (73%) and
target their business activities towards assisting people with disability (35%), young people (33%)ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

and disadvantaged women (28%). In Victoria, 1.8 per cent of the state’s workforce (i.e. 60 000 jobs)
is created by social enterprises, contributing $5.2 billion to the Victorian economy (Source: CSI
Swinburne).
Social enterprises are encouraged (if possible) to obtain Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status
from the Australian Taxation Office, making all donations above $2 to their enterprise fully tax
deductible. This enables them to offer donors the additional advantage of being able to claim
that donation off their taxation, so reducing the donor’s tax liability.
Many social entrepreneurs have great ideas and a social conscience but need some extra
assistance and support to make their enterprise viable and investment-ready. Two groups are
prominent in meeting this need. Social Traders is a not-for-profit organisation formed in 2008
with the purpose of supporting and encouraging the establishment of commercially viable
social enterprises throughout Australia. The Alliance of Social Enterprise Networks Australia
represents seven social enterprise networks in each state and territory.

HoMie (Homelessness
of Melbourne
Incorporated
Enterprise)
The idea behind HoMie began in 2013 after a
group of friends (Marcus Crook, Nick Pearce
and Robbie Gillies) talked to people living on
the streets. They then shared these stories
via their Facebook page ‘Homelessness of
Melbourne’, created to connect with people
experiencing homelessness, thus giving them a
platform to be heard and understood.
and make donating easier through innovative
platforms.
In mid-2016, HoMie opened a permanent
shopfront in Fitzroy where it began selling its
own T-shirts, sweatpants and tops that were
made in ethically accredited factories in China.
Marcus and Nick established this social
enterprise in 2015 with its primary mission
to provide pathways out of homelessness.
HoMie places importance on the following
values: inclusivity, connection, respect and
transparency in all its actions. It does this
by providing new clothing, training and
job opportunities to people experiencing
homelessness. Its other goals are to
change negative public attitudes towards
homelessness, mobilise human compassion
Over time, HoMie has grown to now running
two social impact programs. One of these is VIP
Shopping days, when it closes the shop to the
public one day a month, so people affected by
homelessness can come and select five items
of clothing and enjoy both a free haircut and
lunch. The other program is the HoMie Pathway
Alliance Program. Since its inception in 2017,
this program has expanded and now partners
with Cotton On, the Hanes Group (Champion
and Bonds) and the Retail Prodigy Group (Nike
and TOMS) to provide training (both on-the-job

and employment opportunities
for homeless people. After paying
staff wages, shop rent and paying
for their products to be made,
100 per cent of the profits goes
towards providing pathways out of
homelessness. It’s not just about
shelter, but empowering people to
learn, make social connections and
become self-sufficient. This is HoMie’s
long-term goal, because it leads to
long-term results and fewer people
on the streets.
Figure 1.5 Sleeping rough in Melbourne
HoMie launched a range of upcycled garments in 2020 under its sub-brand REBORN. One product
is an upcycled bomber jacket that led to the brand winning a Victorian Premier’s Design Award.
Another development is the recent partnering with US streetwear brand Champion, which has
resulted in both brands’ logos appearing in a custom-embroidered design.
In 2019–20, HoMie’s revenue was approximately $1.3 million, with 60 per cent coming from sales
and 40 per cent from philanthropic contributions. It also received a small contribution from the
federal government.
HoMie believes ‘that homelessness is a situation you can move out of with the right opportunity,
support, and employment’.

Social enterprises need to be recognised for their important contribution to the economy of
Australia in terms of making it more equitable, stable and sustainable. Social enterprises are driven
by an economic, social, cultural or environmental mission to benefit the community. They aim to
address social issues, such as homelessness or social exclusion, reducing environmental impact
through recycling, or creating responsibly sourced and produced products and services.

government
business
enterprise (GBE)
a business that
is government
owned and
operated.
GBEs seek to
run profitably
by controlling
costs and selling
their goods and
services at a price
to cover costs.
Government business enterprises
A government business enterprise (GBE) operates in the public sector of the Australian
economy. The Australian Government, the six state governments and the two territory
governments have established businesses that operate by adopting a corporate (company)
model. The relationship of the GBEs is similar to that of a holding company and its subsidiaries.
The various governments act as the shareholders for the GBEs and have a strong interest in their
performance and financial returns. The management of a GBE has autonomy over the running
of the business; however, this must be balanced with their regular reporting requirements
to the shareholders and ultimately to parliament and the public. GBEs provide essential
community services, such as communications (Australia Post), telecommunications (National
Broadband Network), housing (Defence Housing Australia), transport (Australian Rail Track
Corporation), energy security (Snowy Hydro), and employment and health services. There are
three characteristics that identify GBEs:
1 The government (federal, state or territory) controls the business.
2 The business is principally engaged in commercial activities.
3 The business has a legal personality separate to a department of government.
CASE STUDY

Three different
government
business enterprises
Snowy Hydro Limited
National Broadband Network
Snowy Hydro was created as a government
business enterprise on 1 July 2018. It operates
on a strictly commercial basis governed by
a board of directors. The Commonwealth
Government is its sole shareholder, receiving
an annual dividend. Its role is to ensure energy
security, underpin the transition to renewables,
and increase competition in energy markets.
The Snowy 2.0 project commenced in 2019
as a major nation-building project that will
underpin Australia’s transition to renewables.
Its renewable portfolio has been expanded to
include contracted energy with 10 wind and
solar projects.
In 2009, a wholly owned Commonwealth
company was established with the purpose
of designing, building and operating an
open-access broadband network to reach

Network (NBN) provides wholesale services
to service providers who deal directly with
the public and businesses. This government
business enterprise is represented by two
shareholder ministers, namely the Minister for
Communications and the Minister for Finance.

Australia Post
Parcels and logistics – the collection,
processing and distribution of parcels. It
also offers a courier mail service and an
integrated logistics service to business for
both domestic and international needs.
Agency services and retail merchandise –
Australia Post agencies perform a range
of services, such as bill payment, banking,
and identity services such as applying for
a passport. Agencies also stock and sell
retail merchandise, such as mail packaging,
stationery, office supplies and small
gift items.
Australia Post is an example of a GBE that is
self-funded and that is required by legislation
to perform a variety of services for the
community. The objective of Australia Post is to
deliver reliable and accessible postal services
for the people of Australia, while at the same
time making a profit. Australia Post’s operations
cover three core areas:
•
Letters and associated services – the
collection, processing and distribution of
letters to Australia and overseas.

Business objectives
Learning intentions –
at the end of this
chapter section I will
be able to:
1.2.1 Identify, define and describe specific listed business
objectives
1.2.2 Apply specific listed business objectives to practical
and/or simulated business solutions
All businesses must establish aims or objectives. These provide an overall or overarching goal,
which can then be translated into action by using strategies. Objectives are statements of
desired achievement and provide the direction for the business and subsequent actions. All
businesses, whether they are small, medium or large, need to establish clear objectives if they
are to succeed.
objectives
statements
of desired
achievement that
provide direction
for the business
Businesses need to put in place multiple objectives that are operational, making use of
resources and efforts, while being convertible into specific strategies, targets and outcomes.
Objectives cover a wide range of areas relating to making a profit, increasing market share,
meeting shareholder expectations and fulfilling the needs of both the market and society.
Other important objectives include improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the business
operations. Objectives are also developed to meet the interests of other stakeholders and
for the provision of goods and services within the limitations of the business’s resources and
budget constraints.
Objectives should be set using the SMART principle.
SMART stands for:
•
•
•
•
•
Specific – the objectives are set and are explicit
Measurable – the outcome and objective can be measured
Attainable/Achievable – the objective is one that can be reached
Realistic/Relevant – objectives are goals that can be reached within the time frame
Timely/Time-bound – the objectives will be reached within a certain period of time.
SMART
objectives or
goals are specific,
measurable,
attainable or
achievable,
relevant or
realistic, and
timely or time-
bound
By adopting the SMART principle, businesses are clear about what they would like to achieve
and aim for.
ACTIVITY 1.4
Evaluate whether the following statements meet the SMART test:
1 Nicole has recently moved from working in the city to a country town to experience a
change in lifestyle. She plans to open a garden nursery business next year and aims to
achieve a 60 per cent market share within two years of commencing operations.
2 Mohammad, who has worked for 10 years for an IT software business in the CBD, has
decided to start up a small IT software business operating from his home office. He would
like the business to make a small profit within four years.
3 Hawa is in Year 12 and would like to gain a high enough ATAR to be offered a place in an
Event Management course at the local university. She is studying four hours every night
and has received high marks for the work she has completed so far.

20 Unit 3 | Managing a business
Objectives influence and direct all levels of a business. There is a hierarchy of objectives, and this
includes:
vision statement
a statement that
outlines the
aspirations and
values of the
business
mission
statement a
statement that
defines what the
business wants to
achieve now
values statement
a statement that
outlines what
the organisation
sees as its
corporate values
and centres on
integrity, honesty
and ethical
behaviour
1 The vision statement and mission statement express the purpose and reason the business
exists and what it aspires to in the future. Virgin Australia, which operates an extensive
network of domestic and international services from its base in Brisbane, states its vision as
being ‘to revolutionise air travel again, this time across all market segments. We will do this
by providing a seamless experience across all international and domestic markets, while
retaining the same excellent service’ (Virgin Australia website). The vision statement outlines
the values of the business and relates to key groups, including shareholders, employees and
customers. Some businesses also produce a values statement, which outlines a business’s
corporate values and cultural priorities. These are usually set by the board of directors or
senior managers and reflect the direction and objectives of the business.
2 Corporate and strategic objectives establish the goals for the rest of the business. Corporate
objectives set the strategic direction (usually long-term, two to five years), and the
departmental objectives (tactical objectives) are set for the next one to two years. Finally,
operational objectives (for a period of less than one year) are set by teams and individuals
within departments.
All of the objectives align to achieve the goals of the business.
ACTIVITY 1.5
1 Explain the difference between a vision statement, a mission statement and a values
statement.
2 Identify the importance for a business of developing a mission statement and a vision
statement.
3 Evaluate the importance of developing a values statement.

To make a profit
Profit, being the difference between revenue and expenses, is regarded as the lifeblood or
primary objective of a business. Profits must be earned to ensure the survival of the business
(both short-term and long-term), its growth and its expansion over time. To make a profit is a
financial objective and relates directly to the desired financial performance of the business.
Usually, a certain level of profit will be determined as acceptable by the business (in terms of its
objectives and the expectations of investors and other institutions).
Many businesses in Australia are part of the private sector and have been established to make
a profit. Reducing the operational costs for a business is one strategy that a business can adopt
to achieve a financial objective ‘to make a profit’. A variety of strategies can then be put in place
to achieve this objective, such as reducing costs associated with providing a product or service.
Other businesses may adopt a strategy, similar to Woolworths’, to transform their business with
the expectation of increasing their level of profit.
market share
proportion or
percentage of the
market (and total
sales) controlled
by the business
To increase market share
Market share is the proportion or percentage of the market (and total sales) controlled by the
business. When a business sets the objective of increasing its market share, it is aiming at gaining a
greater percentage of the market through its sales, resulting in an increased revenue stream.
Businesses produce goods and services. If there is not a demand or need for the product or
service, the business is unlikely to achieve this objective. Many businesses, regardless of their
size, will strive to maximise the appeal of their product or service and to increase market share
wherever possible. Recognising a niche in the market is vital, and many small and medium
businesses do this very well.

efficiency the best
use of resources
in the production
of goods and/or
services
To improve efficiency
Efficiency relates to the best use of resources in the production of goods and/or services.
To achieve an improvement in efficiency, the business needs to achieve more output (goods
produced or services provided) for each unit of input, often referred to as productivity levels.
In the quest to improve efficiency, a business should review and evaluate all its operations to
determine whether improvements can be achieved without leading to additional costs to the
business. A business must work within the constraints of its finances and budgets, as this is an
essential element to business success.
effectiveness
the degree to
which a process
or system is
successful in
achievement
of business
objectives
To improve effectiveness
Effectiveness relates to the degree to which a business achieves its stated objectives – ‘doing
the right things’, which will ultimately yield positive results for the business. To achieve its stated
objectives, the business must ensure that it has in place strategies related directly to those
specific objectives, and measurement tools to assess whether the outcome meets the stated
objective.
For example, if a retail business establishes an objective of increasing market share, it may
decide to purchase new technology to reduce customer handling time at the checkout. The
staff are trained in the new equipment; however, a review of monthly sales data does not reveal
an increase in sales revenue. Feedback from customers also reveals that they feel the use of this
new technology is impersonal and detracts from their shopping experience. If, following the
implementation of the new technology, market share does not increase, the outcome would be
judged as not being achieved and the strategy would be considered ineffective.
market set
of actual or
potential buyers
of a product or
service
To fulfil a market need
It is important for a business to recognise and satisfy the needs of its market, which is the set
of actual or potential buyers of a product or service. The market could be one that is physical,
social or individual. The physical market relates to providing food, clothing, shelter and safety.
The social market relates to satisfying the
need for belonging and affection. The needs
of the individual market relate to gaining
knowledge and allowing for self-expression.
Figure 1.12 A woman selling fruits and vegetables at a produce stand, fulfilling
physical market needs.
For a business, satisfying the needs of its
market is an easy way to increase profits
and sell more products and services. Its
objectives may be to expand a current
product or service into a new market or
to create a new product to meet the need
of an existing or new market. Strategies
would need to be put in place to fulfil the
different needs to get the consumer to
purchase the business’s product or use
its service. A business not only needs to
identify its market, but also needs to assess
the potential size of the market and identify
which part of the market to concentrate on.

fulfil and work towards creating a profitable business.
2
Discuss which is the more important factor when buying clothing: ‘functionality and style’
or price.
To fulfil a social need
Social objectives relate to the role of a business in the community. They go beyond the
financial objectives and revolve around the business as a ‘good citizen’. Social objectives may
relate to a number of different areas, such as the provision of community services and facilities;
contribution to community causes at the local, state, national or world level; providing local job
opportunities; or focusing on the environment by minimising waste and recycling.

ACTIVITY 1.7
Investigate a local business that has put in place some type of community program/s or that
supports a local sporting or other club. Share your example with other members of your class.
To meet shareholder expectations
Shareholders are the owners of a company and are also stakeholders in that business.
Individuals may own the entire company, or through buying shares be involved in the
ownership, based on the number of shares they own, of either private or public companies.
All shareholders expect the business they have invested in to be successful. Shareholders also
expect the business to make a profit, for any shares purchased to increase in value, and for
dividends to be paid. Shareholders can pressure a business, regardless of size, to make certain
decisions and can therefore influence the strategic objectives and direction of the business.
The pressure may be in the form of wanting the business to become more sustainable in its
operations. While this may incur a short-term expense for the business, it has also been shown
that it can contribute to greater profitability in the long term and therefore increased financial
returns for shareholders.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

Businesses in Australia
The way a business is run and the role of the owner(s) varies depending on how those owners
wish to be involved and the various legal implications of different forms of ownership and legal
structure.
Australia operates as a mixed market economy where ownership of resources, property and
factors of production are shared between private individuals and governments. The majority
of businesses are owned by private individuals, groups or institutions, and these are classified
as being in the private sector. There are, however, a significant number of government-owned
businesses that are classified as being in the public sector.
Businesses are integral to the successful functioning of the domestic (Australian) and global
economy. They are important because they:
•
manufacture and sell goods and/or provide services to consumers either in Australia and/or
•
•
•
•
globally
create employment
provide taxation income to the government directly from their earnings
are an important source of innovation and product development
provide infrastructure.

Sole trader
If an individual wants to establish or run a business, becoming a sole trader is the simplest and
most inexpensive form of business structure. It involves a single owner operating a business
under either their own name or a Registered Business Name (RBN). The sole trader assumes
total responsibility for the major decisions of the business relating to planning and operations.
They have the sole right to all profits and capital of the business.
However, in the event of the business incurring losses or debts, the sole trader as the owner is
held totally legally responsible for all debts of the business (unlimited liability). This means
that the owner’s personal assets can be seized to recover a debt. The business may operate
using the personal bank account and tax file number (TFN) of the owner; however, there
is a requirement that the financial records of the business must be retained for at least five
years. A sole trader may employ people to help them run the business. If they choose to do
this, there are several compulsory obligations that must be complied with, including making
superannuation contributions on behalf of employees and obtaining workers’ compensation
insurance. Sole traders are recommended to apply for an RBN as a form of protection for their
business identity and to give their business legitimacy.
Many businesses initially set up as sole traders then progress to other forms of business
structure.

ACTIVITY 1.1
Simon had been working as a pastry chef with a busy restaurant in the city prior to the COVID-19
pandemic. The restaurant decided that due to the numerous lockdowns that had occurred in
Melbourne it would have to close. Simon had created a good reputation for himself, especially
for his pastries and desserts, and was often appearing on reviews on Instagram posted by diners
at the restaurant. Simon decided to try operating a cooking business from his home. Although
known as a good pastry chef, Simon knew nothing about running a business and the type of
business structure he should set up. A friend had suggested that he should become a sole trader.
1 Outline for Simon what it means to be a sole trader.
2 Analyse for Simon what would be the advantages and disadvantages of adopting this form
of business structure for his new catering venture.
Partnership
A business partnership combines the expertise and resources of between two and 20 people
going into business together. Each partner is jointly liable for business debts incurred (unlimited
liability).

There are two types of business partnership:
•
•
general partnership – all partners are deemed equally responsible for management of the
business. Each has unlimited liability for debts and obligations.
limited partnership – liability of one or more partners is limited. These partners (passive
investors) are not involved in day-to-day business operations. Liability is limited in
proportion to the amount invested.
The Partnership Act 1958 (Vic) sets out the rights and duties of the persons involved in
a partnership. Most partnerships are based on a formal legal agreement (partnership
agreement) being entered into by the parties.

Company
Many business owners opt to establish a separate legal entity, being a company, which is
achieved through the process of incorporation. Prior to the company being formed, the business
owners should undertake a name availability search to check whether the name they would like
is available or whether it has already been allocated to another company. The Business Names
Registration Act 2011 sets out words that may not be included in a company name. The company
needs to be formed according to legislation, the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act), and is
then registered with the
Australian Securities and
Investments Commission
(ASIC). An Australian
Company Number (ACN)
must be obtained, and
this number must be
placed on every public
document of the business.
In addition, the business
must designate a registered

Private limited company
A private limited company is easily recognised by its name, as it includes the words ‘Proprietary
Limited’, which are often shortened to ‘Pty Ltd’, at the end of the name. This classification works
to place some restrictions on how this type of company operates:
•
•
•
•
shareholders – the company has a minimum of one shareholder and is restricted to a
maximum of 50 non-employee shareholders
shares – can only be traded with the permission of other shareholders, which must be given
before any transaction takes place
directors – at least one (who lives in Australia)
company secretary – optional.

This form of company is popular with businesses that have previously operated as sole traders
or partnerships but would now like to expand, while also gaining the protection that comes
from creating a separate legal entity and limiting their liability for debts incurred by the
business. It is also a favoured business structure for family businesses wanting to create an
ongoing business structure for future generations of the family.

ACTIVITY 1.2
Barry and his family run a red gum furniture manufacturing business in country Victoria. They
make large items of furniture, such as tables, chairs, sideboards and bookshelves, with the offcuts
of wood being made into chopping boards and bowls. Established initially by Barry as a family
partnership with his two sons, the business now employs five other craftspeople in the factory
to help them keep up with orders. The sales showroom is in the main street of the town and is
very popular with both locals and tourists. Barry does not feel comfortable dealing directly with
customers, preferring to leave the sales negotiations to his five sales staff. Some of the family
members have expressed a desire that the business now change from being a partnership to
become a private limited company.
Barry would like your advice as to the advantages and disadvantages of changing the structure of
the business from a partnership to a private limited company. What would you propose?
Public listed company
As businesses grow in the size of their operations, they may look to the option of becoming a
public company as a means of increasing their number of shares and access to more capital.
To do this the business needs to issue a prospectus, which is a formal document inviting the
public to purchase its shares. A public company does not have any upper limit restrictions
placed on it as to its number of shareholders. Once listed on the Australian Securities
Exchange (ASX), the shares in the company can be openly traded, with the price of the shares

being dependent upon the value perceived by the marketplace. These companies can be
recognised by the word ‘Limited’ (Ltd) after their name, which shows that they offer limited
liability to their shareholders.
There are some restrictions on how this type of company operates:
•
•
•
shareholders – at least one (no limit on the total number)
directors – at least three (two of which must live in Australia)
company secretary – at least one (living in Australia).

Social enterprises
A social enterprise is a type of business that uses strategies to maximise improvements
in human wellbeing or the environment, rather than to maximise profits for its social
entrepreneur owners or shareholders. Whether they are structured as ‘for-profit’ or ‘not-for-
profit’ entities, social enterprises have two main goals: to achieve social, cultural, community
or environmental outcomes, and to earn revenue. Social enterprises are innovative
and sustainable.
Social enterprises are run like a business, as they produce goods or services to sell, but redirect
the surplus in pursuit of social or environmental goals. In other words, a social enterprise aims
to make a profit in order to help solve a social or environmental problem. The majority of
social enterprises adopt the legal structure of a company. To assist them in the management
of their business, the social entrepreneurs behind the business will seek to appoint directors
to their boards who are specialists in key areas, including community development, business,
vocational training, law and accountancy.
It is estimated that there are in excess of 20 000 social enterprises operating across every
industry within the Australian economy. The majority operate as small businesses (73%) and
target their business activities towards assisting people with disability (35%), young people (33%)ISBN 978-1-009-20260-2 © Julie Cain et al 2023 Cambridge University Press

and disadvantaged women (28%). In Victoria, 1.8 per cent of the state’s workforce (i.e. 60 000 jobs)
is created by social enterprises, contributing $5.2 billion to the Victorian economy (Source: CSI
Swinburne).
Social enterprises are encouraged (if possible) to obtain Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status
from the Australian Taxation Office, making all donations above $2 to their enterprise fully tax
deductible. This enables them to offer donors the additional advantage of being able to claim
that donation off their taxation, so reducing the donor’s tax liability.
Many social entrepreneurs have great ideas and a social conscience but need some extra
assistance and support to make their enterprise viable and investment-ready. Two groups are
prominent in meeting this need. Social Traders is a not-for-profit organisation formed in 2008
with the purpose of supporting and encouraging the establishment of commercially viable
social enterprises throughout Australia. The Alliance of Social Enterprise Networks Australia
represents seven social enterprise networks in each state and territory.

Social enterprises:
HoMie (Homelessness
of Melbourne
Incorporated
Enterprise)
The idea behind HoMie began in 2013 after a
group of friends (Marcus Crook, Nick Pearce
and Robbie Gillies) talked to people living on
the streets. They then shared these stories
via their Facebook page ‘Homelessness of
Melbourne’, created to connect with people
experiencing homelessness, thus giving them a
platform to be heard and understood.
and make donating easier through innovative
platforms.
In mid-2016, HoMie opened a permanent
shopfront in Fitzroy where it began selling its
own T-shirts, sweatpants and tops that were
made in ethically accredited factories in China.
Marcus and Nick established this social
enterprise in 2015 with its primary mission
to provide pathways out of homelessness.
HoMie places importance on the following
values: inclusivity, connection, respect and
transparency in all its actions. It does this
by providing new clothing, training and
job opportunities to people experiencing
homelessness. Its other goals are to
change negative public attitudes towards
homelessness, mobilise human compassion
Over time, HoMie has grown to now running
two social impact programs. One of these is VIP
Shopping days, when it closes the shop to the
public one day a month, so people affected by
homelessness can come and select five items
of clothing and enjoy both a free haircut and
lunch. The other program is the HoMie Pathway
Alliance Program. Since its inception in 2017,
this program has expanded and now partners
with Cotton On, the Hanes Group (Champion
and Bonds) and the Retail Prodigy Group (Nike
and TOMS) to provide training (both on-the-job

and employment opportunities
for homeless people. After paying
staff wages, shop rent and paying
for their products to be made,
100 per cent of the profits goes
towards providing pathways out of
homelessness. It’s not just about
shelter, but empowering people to
learn, make social connections and
become self-sufficient. This is HoMie’s
long-term goal, because it leads to
long-term results and fewer people
on the streets.
Figure 1.5 Sleeping rough in Melbourne
HoMie launched a range of upcycled garments in 2020 under its sub-brand REBORN. One product
is an upcycled bomber jacket that led to the brand winning a Victorian Premier’s Design Award.
Another development is the recent partnering with US streetwear brand Champion, which has
resulted in both brands’ logos appearing in a custom-embroidered design.
In 2019–20, HoMie’s revenue was approximately $1.3 million, with 60 per cent coming from sales
and 40 per cent from philanthropic contributions. It also received a small contribution from the
federal government.
HoMie believes ‘that homelessness is a situation you can move out of with the right opportunity,
support, and employment’.

Social enterprises need to be recognised for their important contribution to the economy of
Australia in terms of making it more equitable, stable and sustainable. Social enterprises are driven
by an economic, social, cultural or environmental mission to benefit the community. They aim to
address social issues, such as homelessness or social exclusion, reducing environmental impact
through recycling, or creating responsibly sourced and produced products and services.

Fruit2Work (F2W) is a certified social enterprise
delivering a high-quality, personalised fruit
and milk service to workplaces in and around
Melbourne’s CBD and metropolitan areas.
This social enterprise provides meaningful
employment opportunities for people who
have been impacted by the justice system. F2W
allows its employees to gain important skills and
experiences to assist them to reset their lives
and return to society as contributing members.
Unfortunately, statistics indicate that half of the
people released from prison today will reoffend
and return to prison in less than two years. By
creating chances for meaningful employment
opportunity, F2W believes it has reduced the

government
business
enterprise (GBE)
a business that
is government
owned and
operated.
GBEs seek to
run profitably
by controlling
costs and selling
their goods and
services at a price
to cover costs.
Government business enterprises
A government business enterprise (GBE) operates in the public sector of the Australian
economy. The Australian Government, the six state governments and the two territory
governments have established businesses that operate by adopting a corporate (company)
model. The relationship of the GBEs is similar to that of a holding company and its subsidiaries.
The various governments act as the shareholders for the GBEs and have a strong interest in their
performance and financial returns. The management of a GBE has autonomy over the running
of the business; however, this must be balanced with their regular reporting requirements
to the shareholders and ultimately to parliament and the public. GBEs provide essential
community services, such as communications (Australia Post), telecommunications (National
Broadband Network), housing (Defence Housing Australia), transport (Australian Rail Track
Corporation), energy security (Snowy Hydro), and employment and health services. There are
three characteristics that identify GBEs:
1 The government (federal, state or territory) controls the business.
2 The business is principally engaged in commercial activities.
3 The business has a legal personality separate to a department of government.

Three different
government
business enterprises
Snowy Hydro Limited
National Broadband Network
Snowy Hydro was created as a government
business enterprise on 1 July 2018. It operates
on a strictly commercial basis governed by
a board of directors. The Commonwealth
Government is its sole shareholder, receiving
an annual dividend. Its role is to ensure energy
security, underpin the transition to renewables,
and increase competition in energy markets.
The Snowy 2.0 project commenced in 2019
as a major nation-building project that will
underpin Australia’s transition to renewables.
Its renewable portfolio has been expanded to
include contracted energy with 10 wind and
solar projects.
In 2009, a wholly owned Commonwealth
company was established with the purpose
of designing, building and operating an
open-access broadband network to reach

also offers a courier mail service and an
integrated logistics service to business for
both domestic and international needs.
Agency services and retail merchandise –
Australia Post agencies perform a range
of services, such as bill payment, banking,
and identity services such as applying for
a passport. Agencies also stock and sell
retail merchandise, such as mail packaging,
stationery, office supplies and small
gift items.
Australia Post is an example of a GBE that is
self-funded and that is required by legislation
to perform a variety of services for the
community. The objective of Australia Post is to
deliver reliable and accessible postal services
for the people of Australia, while at the same
time making a profit. Australia Post’s operations
cover three core areas:

Letters and associated services – the
collection, processing and distribution of
letters to Australia and overseas.

Business objectives
Learning intentions –
at the end of this
chapter section I will
be able to:
1.2.1 Identify, define and describe specific listed business
objectives
1.2.2 Apply specific listed business objectives to practical
and/or simulated business solutions
All businesses must establish aims or objectives. These provide an overall or overarching goal,
which can then be translated into action by using strategies. Objectives are statements of
desired achievement and provide the direction for the business and subsequent actions. All
businesses, whether they are small, medium or large, need to establish clear objectives if they
are to succeed.
objectives
statements
of desired
achievement that
provide direction
for the business
Businesses need to put in place multiple objectives that are operational, making use of
resources and efforts, while being convertible into specific strategies, targets and outcomes.
Objectives cover a wide range of areas relating to making a profit, increasing market share,
meeting shareholder expectations and fulfilling the needs of both the market and society.
Other important objectives include improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the business
operations. Objectives are also developed to meet the interests of other stakeholders and
for the provision of goods and services within the limitations of the business’s resources and
budget constraints.
Objectives should be set using the SMART principle.
SMART stands for:
•
•
•
•
•
Specific – the objectives are set and are explicit
Measurable – the outcome and objective can be measured
Attainable/Achievable – the objective is one that can be reached
Realistic/Relevant – objectives are goals that can be reached within the time frame
Timely/Time-bound – the objectives will be reached within a certain period of time.
SMART
objectives or
goals are specific,
measurable,
attainable or
achievable,
relevant or
realistic, and
timely or time-
bound
By adopting the SMART principle, businesses are clear about what they would like to achieve
and aim for.
ACTIVITY 1.4
Evaluate whether the following statements meet the SMART test:
1 Nicole has recently moved from working in the city to a country town to experience a
change in lifestyle. She plans to open a garden nursery business next year and aims to
achieve a 60 per cent market share within two years of commencing operations.
2 Mohammad, who has worked for 10 years for an IT software business in the CBD, has
decided to start up a small IT software business operating from his home office. He would
like the business to make a small profit within four years.
3 Hawa is in Year 12 and would like to gain a high enough ATAR to be offered a place in an
Event Management course at the local university. She is studying four hours every night
and has received high marks for the work she has completed so far.

Objectives influence and direct all levels of a business. There is a hierarchy of objectives, and this
includes:
vision statement
a statement that
outlines the
aspirations and
values of the
business
mission
statement a
statement that
defines what the
business wants to
achieve now
values statement
a statement that
outlines what
the organisation
sees as its
corporate values
and centres on
integrity, honesty
and ethical
behaviour
1 The vision statement and mission statement express the purpose and reason the business
exists and what it aspires to in the future. Virgin Australia, which operates an extensive
network of domestic and international services from its base in Brisbane, states its vision as
being ‘to revolutionise air travel again, this time across all market segments. We will do this
by providing a seamless experience across all international and domestic markets, while
retaining the same excellent service’ (Virgin Australia website). The vision statement outlines
the values of the business and relates to key groups, including shareholders, employees and
customers. Some businesses also produce a values statement, which outlines a business’s
corporate values and cultural priorities. These are usually set by the board of directors or
senior managers and reflect the direction and objectives of the business.
2 Corporate and strategic objectives establish the goals for the rest of the business. Corporate
objectives set the strategic direction (usually long-term, two to five years), and the
departmental objectives (tactical objectives) are set for the next one to two years. Finally,
operational objectives (for a period of less than one year) are set by teams and individuals
within departments.
All of the objectives align to achieve the goals of the business.
ACTIVITY 1.5
1 Explain the difference between a vision statement, a mission statement and a values
statement.
2 Identify the importance for a business of developing a mission statement and a vision
statement.
3 Evaluate the importance of developing a values statement.

To make a profit
Profit, being the difference between revenue and expenses, is regarded as the lifeblood or
primary objective of a business. Profits must be earned to ensure the survival of the business
(both short-term and long-term), its growth and its expansion over time. To make a profit is a
financial objective and relates directly to the desired financial performance of the business.
Usually, a certain level of profit will be determined as acceptable by the business (in terms of its
objectives and the expectations of investors and other institutions).
Many businesses in Australia are part of the private sector and have been established to make
a profit. Reducing the operational costs for a business is one strategy that a business can adopt
to achieve a financial objective ‘to make a profit’. A variety of strategies can then be put in place
to achieve this objective, such as reducing costs associated with providing a product or service.
Other businesses may adopt a strategy, similar to Woolworths’, to transform their business with
the expectation of increasing their level of profit.
market share
proportion or
percentage of the
market (and total
sales) controlled
by the business
To increase market share
Market share is the proportion or percentage of the market (and total sales) controlled by the
business. When a business sets the objective of increasing its market share, it is aiming at gaining a
greater percentage of the market through its sales, resulting in an increased revenue stream.
Businesses produce goods and services. If there is not a demand or need for the product or
service, the business is unlikely to achieve this objective. Many businesses, regardless of their
size, will strive to maximise the appeal of their product or service and to increase market share
wherever possible. Recognising a niche in the market is vital, and many small and medium
businesses do this very well.

efficiency the best
use of resources
in the production
of goods and/or
services
To improve efficiency
Efficiency relates to the best use of resources in the production of goods and/or services.
To achieve an improvement in efficiency, the business needs to achieve more output (goods
produced or services provided) for each unit of input, often referred to as productivity levels.
In the quest to improve efficiency, a business should review and evaluate all its operations to
determine whether improvements can be achieved without leading to additional costs to the
business. A business must work within the constraints of its finances and budgets, as this is an
essential element to business success.
effectiveness
the degree to
which a process
or system is
successful in
achievement
of business
objectives
To improve effectiveness
Effectiveness relates to the degree to which a business achieves its stated objectives – ‘doing
the right things’, which will ultimately yield positive results for the business. To achieve its stated
objectives, the business must ensure that it has in place strategies related directly to those
specific objectives, and measurement tools to assess whether the outcome meets the stated
objective.
For example, if a retail business establishes an objective of increasing market share, it may
decide to purchase new technology to reduce customer handling time at the checkout. The
staff are trained in the new equipment; however, a review of monthly sales data does not reveal
an increase in sales revenue. Feedback from customers also reveals that they feel the use of this
new technology is impersonal and detracts from their shopping experience. If, following the
implementation of the new technology, market share does not increase, the outcome would be
judged as not being achieved and the strategy would be considered ineffective.
market set
of actual or
potential buyers
of a product or
service
To fulfil a market need
It is important for a business to recognise and satisfy the needs of its market, which is the set
of actual or potential buyers of a product or service. The market could be one that is physical,
social or individual. The physical market relates to providing food, clothing, shelter and safety.
The social market relates to satisfying the
need for belonging and affection. The needs
of the individual market relate to gaining
knowledge and allowing for self-expression.
Figure 1.12 A woman selling fruits and vegetables at a produce stand, fulfilling
physical market needs.
For a business, satisfying the needs of its
market is an easy way to increase profits
and sell more products and services. Its
objectives may be to expand a current
product or service into a new market or
to create a new product to meet the need
of an existing or new market. Strategies
would need to be put in place to fulfil the
different needs to get the consumer to
purchase the business’s product or use
its service. A business not only needs to
identify its market, but also needs to assess
the potential size of the market and identify
which part of the market to concentrate on.

Social objectives relate to the role of a business in the community. They go beyond the
financial objectives and revolve around the business as a ‘good citizen’. Social objectives may
relate to a number of different areas, such as the provision of community services and facilities;
contribution to community causes at the local, state, national or world level; providing local job
opportunities; or focusing on the environment by minimising waste and recycling.

ACTIVITY 1.7
Investigate a local business that has put in place some type of community program/s or that
supports a local sporting or other club. Share your example with other members of your class.
To meet shareholder expectations
Shareholders are the owners of a company and are also stakeholders in that business.
Individuals may own the entire company, or through buying shares be involved in the
ownership, based on the number of shares they own, of either private or public companies.
All shareholders expect the business they have invested in to be successful. Shareholders also
expect the business to make a profit, for any shares purchased to increase in value, and for
dividends to be paid. Shareholders can pressure a business, regardless of size, to make certain
decisions and can therefore influence the strategic objectives and direction of the business.
The pressure may be in the form of wanting the business to become more sustainable in its
operations. While this may incur a short-term expense for the business, it has also been shown
that it can contribute to greater profitability in the long term and therefore increased financial
returns for shareholders.

COGNITIVE LEVEL: toLevel5 (Analyze & Evaluate)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TARGET: Break down relationships, make judgments, assess validity.
TEST: Can student compare, contrast, infer, critique, or synthesise?
QUESTION TYPES: Compare/contrast, identify relationships, evaluate claims, infer from data, critique reasoning.
STEMS: "Which conclusion is supported by...", "Compare X and Y...", "The evidence suggests...", "Evaluate the claim that..."
REQUIRE: Multi-step reasoning. May include data, scenarios, or competing claims to evaluate.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Exactly 10 questions total matching the specified mix (8 MC, 2 Cloze, 0 TF)
- LENGTH PARITY: All MC options must be similar length. Do NOT make correct answer longer than distractors. Keep correct answers pithy OR extend all distractors to match.
- All distractors must be real misconceptions, never absurd
- Verify factual accuracy—do not hallucinate
- One unambiguous correct answer per question
- Include the _link block exactly as shown with actual values
- Output raw JSON only
