      "correct": "A Pty Ltd is preferable because it protects founders' personal assets while allowing future capital raising through share issuance",
      "correctExplanation": "The combination of high risk and growth potential makes limited liability essential, and the Pty Ltd structure allows future share issuance for growth.",
