      "correct": "It depends on whether the company can accept the regulatory burden",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Public listing increases the founders' control over all decisions", "explanation": "Public listing dilutes ownership. Unless founders retain a majority, their control decreases as more shares are issued to public investors." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because private companies are always more profitable than public ones", "explanation": "Profitability depends on business operations, not the listing status. Some companies stay private for control reasons, not profitability." },
