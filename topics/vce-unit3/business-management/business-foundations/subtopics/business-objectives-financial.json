  "what": "This subtopic covers the objectives of making a profit, increasing market share and fulfilling a market need, as well as the SMART principle for setting effective objectives and the role of vision, mission and values statements.",
  "why": "Financial and market objectives drive strategic decisions in business. Understanding how to set, apply and evaluate these objectives is essential for analysing real and simulated business scenarios.",

      "what": "SMART objectives are Specific, Measurable, Attainable/Achievable, Realistic/Relevant, and Timely/Time-bound. This framework ensures objectives are clear and actionable.",
      "why": "Setting SMART objectives gives a business clear targets and a way to measure progress, which is critical for strategic planning.",
      "example": "A sole trader who aims to 'increase revenue by 15% within the next 12 months by expanding online sales' meets the SMART criteria. An objective to 'do better next year' does not, because it is not specific or measurable.",

      "title": "I can distinguish between vision statements, mission statements and values statements",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "A vision statement outlines what the business aspires to be in the future. A mission statement defines what the business wants to achieve now. A values statement outlines the organisation's corporate values, centring on integrity, honesty and ethical behaviour.",
      "why": "These statements provide the overarching direction from which specific business objectives are developed and aligned.",
      "example": "Virgin Australia's vision is 'to revolutionise air travel again, this time across all market segments'. Its mission focuses on providing seamless experiences across domestic and international markets.",

      "title": "I can define profit and explain why making a profit is a primary business objective",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Profit is the difference between revenue and expenses. It is considered the lifeblood of a business because it ensures survival, enables growth and expansion, and meets investor expectations. One strategy to increase profit is reducing operational costs.",
      "why": "Profit is the most fundamental financial objective. Without profit, a private sector business cannot sustain its operations in the long term.",
      "example": "A retail business with $500,000 in revenue and $420,000 in expenses makes a profit of $80,000. It could increase profit by negotiating lower supplier costs to reduce expenses to $400,000, raising profit to $100,000.",

      "title": "I can define market share and explain strategies to increase it",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Market share is the proportion or percentage of total sales in a market controlled by a business. Increasing market share means gaining a greater percentage of sales relative to competitors, resulting in increased revenue.",
      "why": "Higher market share often translates to greater revenue, stronger brand recognition and more influence within an industry.",
      "example": "Twins Pantry targets a niche in the gourmet nut market by offering dairy-free, preservative-free products at farmers' markets, using roasting aromas and free tastings to attract customers and grow their market share.",

      "title": "I can explain the objective of fulfilling a market need and apply it to business scenarios",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Fulfilling a market need means recognising and satisfying the demands of actual or potential buyers. Markets can be physical (food, clothing, shelter), social (belonging, affection) or individual (knowledge, self-expression). A business must identify its market, assess its size and decide which segment to target.",
      "why": "A business that fails to meet a genuine market need is unlikely to generate sales or survive. Identifying gaps in the market is often the starting point for a successful business.",
      "example": "Bandicute identified a gap in children's clothing: most designs featured foreign animals like foxes and raccoons. By creating clothing featuring Australian animals, they fulfilled a previously unmet market need for Australian-themed kids' clothing.",
