  "what": "This subtopic covers the objectives of improving efficiency, improving effectiveness, fulfilling a social need and meeting shareholder expectations.",
  "why": "Beyond financial goals, businesses must operate efficiently, achieve their stated objectives, contribute to the community and satisfy their owners. These objectives shape daily operations and long-term strategy.",

      "what": "Efficiency relates to the best use of resources in the production of goods or services. Improving efficiency means achieving more output for each unit of input (higher productivity) without incurring additional costs.",
      "why": "Improving efficiency directly reduces costs per unit, which can increase profit margins and make a business more competitive.",
      "example": "A factory that produces 100 chairs per day with 10 workers (10 chairs per worker) improves efficiency by reorganising the production line to produce 120 chairs per day with the same 10 workers (12 chairs per worker).",

      "title": "I can define effectiveness and distinguish it from efficiency",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Effectiveness is the degree to which a business achieves its stated objectives — 'doing the right things'. A business can be efficient (low cost per unit) but not effective if it is not achieving its actual goals. Measurement tools are needed to assess whether outcomes match objectives.",
      "why": "A strategy that reduces costs (efficient) but fails to increase market share as intended (ineffective) has not achieved its purpose. Both concepts matter, but they measure different things.",
      "example": "A retail store installs faster checkout technology to increase market share. The technology reduces handling time (efficient), but monthly sales data shows no increase in revenue and customers find it impersonal. The strategy was efficient but not effective.",

      "title": "I can describe social objectives and explain how businesses fulfil a social need",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Social objectives relate to the role of a business as a 'good citizen' in the community. They may include providing community services, supporting local causes, creating local employment, minimising waste, recycling, or implementing workplace policies such as equal opportunity and anti-bullying.",
      "why": "Social objectives demonstrate corporate responsibility and can enhance a business's reputation, which may contribute to long-term profitability and customer loyalty.",
      "example": "Officeworks partnered with Greening Australia to plant two trees for every one used in its paper products, with over one million trees planted and a goal of two million by 2025.",

      "title": "I can explain the objective of meeting shareholder expectations",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Shareholders are the owners of a company and expect the business to be successful, make a profit, increase share value and pay dividends. They can pressure the business to make certain decisions, influencing strategic objectives and direction.",
      "why": "Shareholder expectations drive many corporate decisions. Balancing short-term returns with long-term sustainability is a key challenge for company directors.",
      "example": "Shareholders of a public listed company may pressure the board to invest in sustainable operations. While this increases short-term costs, it can lead to greater long-term profitability and higher share prices.",

      "title": "I can apply multiple business objectives to practical or simulated business scenarios",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Applying objectives means using the concepts of profit, market share, efficiency, effectiveness, market need, social need and shareholder expectations to analyse real or hypothetical business situations and recommend strategies.",
      "why": "The ability to apply objectives to scenarios is a key exam skill tested through case studies that require analysis, evaluation and recommendations.",
      "example": "A case study about Woolworths might require you to explain how its six key priorities relate to objectives such as increasing market share (through digital acceleration), improving efficiency (through its operating model) and fulfilling a social need (through community initiatives).",
