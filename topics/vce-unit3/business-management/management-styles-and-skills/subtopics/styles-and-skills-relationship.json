  "icon": "🔗",
  "what": "This subtopic examines how management styles and management skills are interconnected, and how the effectiveness of a manager can be assessed by evaluating whether the style and skills adopted were appropriate for the situation.",
  "why": "The study design explicitly requires understanding the relationship between styles and skills. Exam questions often ask you to link a specific style to the skills a manager would need, and to evaluate whether the combination was effective.",

      "title": "I can identify which management skills are most likely to be used with each management style",
      "code": "3.3.1a",
      "what": "Different styles emphasise different skills. An autocratic manager relies heavily on one-way communication and centralised decision-making. A participative manager uses delegation, open communication, interpersonal skills and shared decision-making. A laissez-faire manager relies on delegation and trusts employees' own leading and decision-making abilities.",
      "why": "This connection is frequently tested. Being able to match skills to styles demonstrates a deeper understanding of how management works in practice.",
      "example": "An autocratic manager primarily uses top-down communication and centralised decision-making, with minimal delegation. A participative manager uses open two-way communication, extensive delegation, collaborative decision-making and strong interpersonal skills to build team cohesion.",

      "title": "I can describe the criteria used to assess whether a manager's style and skills were effective",
      "code": "3.3.1b",
      "what": "Effectiveness can be assessed across several areas: whether outcomes and objectives were achieved, the quality of communication flow, employee motivation and job satisfaction, level of teamwork, staff absenteeism and turnover, training opportunities provided, and performance appraisal processes.",
      "why": "These criteria provide a structured way to evaluate management effectiveness in exam responses. Using specific criteria strengthens your evaluation and helps you earn higher marks.",
      "example": "To evaluate Matt Comyn's effectiveness as CEO of CBA, you could assess whether the bank addressed its regulatory challenges (outcomes), whether employees felt proud and confident (motivation), and whether the corporate culture improved (communication and interpersonal relationships).",

      "title": "I can analyse how a management style impacts corporate culture and business performance",
      "code": "3.3.1c",
      "what": "The management style adopted directly shapes the corporate culture — the shared values and beliefs within a business. A consultative or participative style tends to create an open, collaborative culture, while an autocratic style may create a hierarchical, compliance-focused culture.",
      "why": "The study design links corporate culture to management styles and skills. Being able to analyse this relationship is essential for extended response questions.",
      "example": "By adopting a consultative style, Mick and Richard at Leaf Inventions demonstrate they value employee input while maintaining control. This creates a corporate culture where employees feel heard and motivated, but clear direction still comes from the top.",
