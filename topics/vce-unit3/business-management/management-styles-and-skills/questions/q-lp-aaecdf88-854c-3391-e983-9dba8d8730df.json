A conflict erupts between two employees whose cultural norms about hierarchy and directness differ significantly. Evaluate how a manager should apply interpersonal skills to navigate this culturally sensitive conflict.",
      "correct": "Use empathy to understand each employee's cultural perspective, respect their diverse values, and facilitate a resolution that acknowledges cultural differences while establishing shared workplace norms",

The manager genuinely understands the employee's childcare challenges but cannot grant the request due to business needs.

      "correct": "Empathy helps the employee feel heard and valued even when the answer is no, preserving the relationship and reducing resentment about the decision",

      "correct": "Use empathy to validate both perspectives, acknowledge their experience and passion, and collaboratively explore how elements of both approaches might be integrated or trialled",
