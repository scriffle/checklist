TITLE: I can identify and name the five management styles on the continuum from task-oriented to people-oriented
CODE: 3.1.1

WHAT (concept explanation):
The five management styles are autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire. They sit on a continuum from task-oriented (autocratic) to people-oriented (laissez-faire).

WHY (importance):
Recognising where each style sits on the continuum helps you quickly compare them and understand their underlying philosophy.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
If asked to arrange styles from most to least centralised, the order would be: autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative, laissez-faire.

SUBTOPIC: Management Styles
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the five management styles — autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire — and their key characteristics. It examines how each style differs in terms of control, communication, decision-making and employee orientation.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the distinct features of each management style is essential for analysing how businesses are run. Being able to identify and describe these styles is a foundational skill tested in SACs and exams.

TOPIC: Management styles and skills
SUBJECT: Business Management | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: An exploration of the five management styles, six management skills, and the relationship between them in achieving business objectives.

an ‘effective leader’.
CHAPTER OVERVIEW
Managing a business of any size can be a complex and challenging
task for the business’s owners and managers. The majority of
businesses will establish as one of their main objectives ‘growing the
value of the business’. The leaders or senior managers of that business
must set a clear vision and be able to continually communicate the
vision. Their role is to then get out of the way and let the second-line
managers do their job. The choice of management style and skills
adopted by these managers will differ. Ideally, the style and skills
adopted should be appropriate to the situation within the business.

style the manner
and approach
of providing

people
A management style, broadly speaking, is the manner and approach of providing direction,
implementing plans and motivating people that is adopted by a manager. There are distinctly
different styles of management: autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire.
Management styles can have specific features. For example, the way managers interact with
employees will depend on how they exercise authority, the degree of task or employee
orientation, and the manner of communication (‘top-down’, ‘bottom-up’ or lateral). The type of
management structure adopted by the business in order to achieve its goals and objectives,
such as bureaucratic (multilayered), a flatter structure or a team-based structure, will also
impact on the style chosen.
Most managers use a range of styles based on the situation that is required to be managed, their
own (manager’s) personality, the characteristics of their subordinates and any time constraints.
For instance, if a manager wanted to introduce 12-hour shifts to raise productivity by increasing
the utilisation of expensive plant and equipment, it is unlikely that an autocratic task-oriented
style would be effective in managing this situation. A participative or consultative management
style, where employee input was sought and considered before making a decision, would be
more appropriate.
Management styles can be demonstrated using a continuum of management approaches
based on their orientation towards the task or employees/people. At one end of the continuum,
the importance of the task outweighs that of the employees/people. The other end places
greater importance on the people, while not forgetting the importance of task achievement.

Types of management style
Management style refers to the different ways in which managers behave. The preferred style
of a manager will depend on many factors, such as cultural styles of leadership and the type
of business.
Autocratic management style
Autocratic management style (authoritarian) is often referred to as the classical
management style.
The characteristics of the autocratic management style are outlined in Table 3.1.
Table 3.1 The characteristics of the autocratic management style
Characteristic Description
Control and authority autocratic
management

(authoritarian)
management
style where all
decision-making
is centralised,
there is little

authority and

is one-way –
downwards
Managers want to be in control and retain authority, particularly
when undertaking planning, coordinating and monitoring various
human and physical activities of the business. They want to be the
main person guiding employees towards achieving the objectives
of the business.
Task-oriented Great importance is placed on achieving the task and following
established process. Policies and procedures are maintained in
detail and enforced by frequent checks.
Motivating factor Main motivator for work performance is payment (i.e. money)
Decision-making Centralised and controlled by the manager with decision or
orders then passed on or told to subordinates
Employees’ contribution Little value is placed on the importance of the employees’
contribution to the overall performance of the business. The
objectives, aims and operating environments reflect the ideas,
beliefs and values of the manager.
Communication Centralised with a strict top-down or hierarchical chain-of-
command approach to management
centralised

management

those below it
in a hierarchy;
communication

and worker
participation in
decision-making
is non-existent
An autocratic manager has a high regard for production and efficiency (task-oriented).
Managers expect team members to comply with their decisions and they are not concerned
with the attitude or thinking of the group. This can result in passive resistance from team
members, which requires the manager to then apply continual pressure and direction in
order to get things done. If this style is adopted by the CEO of a business, it can result in high-
potential employees and even members of the senior management team walking out the door
because their ideas and views are not being heard. Managers adopting this style often use
punishment and rewards to achieve their objectives.

Table 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages of an autocratic management style
Advantages Disadvantages
Decision-making is quick, as only one person
needs to be involved
A quick decision is not always the best
decision
Decisions are made by an experienced leader Discourages teamwork; employees’ opinions
and input are not sought
Communication is direct Does not allow for open communication and
feedback on ideas
Roles and expectations of employees are
defined and monitored
Low motivation and job satisfaction, as
workers are not empowered; staff turnover
may increase when staff feel undervalued
High regard for production and efficiency Too task-focused, with insufficient regard for
employees as people with needs; does not
take account of needs of generations X and Y
and baby boomer employees
Suits high-risk or difficult decisions (e.g.
closure of business operations, retrenchment
of staff)
Creates feelings of unease and being ‘kept
in the dark’; can create a ‘them’ versus
‘us’ attitude
One industry that focuses on results and efficiency as being paramount is hospitality – in
particular, restaurants. Diners expect to receive timely, orderly service and quality food, while
restaurants are generally being run on slim margins, relying heavily on positive reviews and
return customers. Their business will suffer even from small mistakes. In the kitchen, it can be
the head chef adopting all the characteristics of an autocratic manager, ordering and ruling over
the kitchen staff with an iron hand. One extreme example is renowned chef Gordon Ramsay.
The maître d’hôtel responsible for the waiting staff will often also adopt this style.
ACTIVITY 3.1
Describe how you might feel if you were an employee under the management of an
autocratic manager. Explain how these feelings may disrupt or even aid your ability to be a
productive employee.

Persuasive management style
A persuasive management style is that of a manager who uses their ability to interpret
a situation, people’s actions and dialogue, and then strongly urges or convinces them to
do a task or achieve objectives the manager’s way. This style has many characteristics in
common with the autocratic style. The main difference between the styles, however, is
that once a persuasive manager makes a decision, they then try to convince a subordinate
that what was decided by the manager is in the subordinate’s best interests. For example,
a marketing department manager who has an idea for increasing sales targets will try to
convince the rest of the marketing team that only their idea will improve the sales targets.

This type of manager will try to bring people around to their own view, while sticking to
their decision with or without agreement. Under this type of management style, employees
will have a better idea of what to do when there is a change externally or internally,
because the manager has explained their intentions.
The characteristics of the persuasive management style are outlined in Table 3.3.
Table 3.3 The characteristics of the persuasive management style
Characteristic Description
Control and authority Centralised
Task-oriented Great importance on achieving the task and following the established
process. The manager ensures that policies and procedures are
maintained in detail and enforced by frequent checks.
Motivating factor Believes that payment (money) for tasks performed is the main
motivator for work performance
Decision-making Centralised or controlled by management, with the decision or order
then explained or presented to subordinates
Employees’ contribution Some value placed on contribution of employees to overall
performance of the business. The objectives, aims and operating
environments still, however, reflect the ideas, beliefs and values of
the manager.
Communication Centralised, with a strict top-down or hierarchical chain-of-command
approach to management
Table 3.4 Advantages and disadvantages of a persuasive management style
Advantages Disadvantages
Decision-making is quick and still made by
one person
No input from workers into decision-making
process; undervalues benefits of teamwork
Suits high-risk decisions (e.g. closure of
factory, redundancies)
Workers can still feel alienated, as their
opinions are not sought
Employees have a clear idea about what they
have to do and achieve
Opportunities for employee initiative and
commitment overlooked, leading to low levels
of motivation and job satisfaction

consultative
management
style manager
consults with
employees when

issue; however,
the ultimate

based on the
suggestions and
input received
Consultative management style
A consultative management style takes into
account the opinions of team members before
making a decision. This style is moving further
along the continuum from being purely task-
centred to taking the people/employees more
into account. For example, a school principal
may ask the student leadership group, parents
and staff for their suggestions on a new uniform,
then consider all the arguments and make a
decision on the type of uniform that will be
introduced. Another example is when a team
leader of a project holds weekly meetings with
the team members where they are given the
opportunity to share progress of their job tasks
and responsibilities. The meetings allow team
members the opportunity to provide feedback
on areas needing improvement. The team leader
can then use this feedback to review and set
schedules, allocate resources and prioritise tasks
and goals for the coming week.
The characteristics of the consultative
management style are outlined in Table 3.5.
Figure 3.2 A consultative manager seeks input from
their staff.
Table 3.5 The characteristics of the consultative management style
Characteristic Description
Control and authority Centralised and exercised by the manager. More employee-based
and less centralised than autocratic and persuasive styles. Ideas and
concepts provided by employees.
Task achievement Important driving factor, balancing with understanding of ‘people
factor’
Motivating factor Reasonable level of employee involvement, resulting in more
motivated employees wanting to perform at their best. Values

Advantages Disadvantages
Gain a variety of ideas from the suggestions
of employees, which will lead to a better
decision-making outcome
Employees may not understand the
complexity of the problem being discussed
Reasonable level of employee involvement Time-consuming if many stakeholders are
consulted
Acts to motivate and increase an employee’s
level of job satisfaction
Employees may still not feel valued if they
have provided their ideas but these are
overlooked
Participative management style
The participative management style has become very popular because it focuses on the
interaction between management and employees. This style keeps employees informed about
issues that affect their work, with management and employees sharing in decision-making
and problem-solving tasks. The manager is now acting more as a coach who gets their team of
employees to work together to improve the overall performance of the business. The manager
does not delegate away responsibility, as they still are entitled to have the final say.
The characteristics of the participative management style are outlined in Table 3.7.
Table 3.7 The characteristics of the participative management style
Characteristic Description
Control and authority Decentralised approach. Corporate objectives, while determined
by senior management, are followed by setting departmental,

Table 3.8 Advantages and disadvantages of a participative management style
Advantages Disadvantages
Manager demonstrates trust and faith in the

Can give rise to conflict between employees
who question the ability of their co-workers
Employee morale is increased, as employees
feel part of the process of the business;
this leads to an increase in motivation and

than job satisfaction
Employees feel a sense of ownership and
empowerment as they are now decision-
makers
Lack of contribution by all employees, as some
would rather not be involved in decision-
making, preferring to be told what to do
Decision-making, particularly at middle to
lower levels of the business, is improved
because employees are involved in making
decisions on actions directly related to
them. A diversity of viewpoints is evident
in discussions.

Shared vision and direction between
management and employees towards

Laissez-faire management style
The laissez-faire management style can also be
called ‘free-rein’ or ‘hands-off’ style. It is a style in which
management provides little direction to employees.
Management’s involvement and responsibility often
relate to outlining budgetary constraints, coordinating
timelines and ensuring that broad corporate objectives
are achieved. Employees are then empowered to
determine their own objectives, solve their own
problems and make their own decisions.
Figure 3.3 Sharing creative and innovative ideas with team members
is an important characteristic of the laissez-faire management style.

This style is commonly found in workplaces where the employees are highly educated, skilled
and experienced. This group of employees require little direction and have their own motivation
(drive) to accomplish, and take pride in their accomplishments. It is also found in businesses
that are in the ‘start-up’ phase or incubator phase of product development. Examples of
businesses where the laissez-faire management style could work well are advertising agencies,
product design firms, start-up social media businesses, and specialised engineering, medical
research or architectural businesses. For instance, a manager of a website development
company could entrust the website designers to work independently with little interference
from the manager when fulfilling the customer’s needs. Group members would be allowed to
perform as they like, so far as this does not violate the objectives and policies of the business,
and tasks are completed within budgets and agreed timelines. This style also suits the dynamic
nature of an advertising company where creative freedom is very important.
Table 3.9 Advantages and disadvantages of the laissez-faire management style
Advantages Disadvantages
High employee independence, as employees
can set their own tasks with little involvement
from management
Lack of guidance can cause some employees
to have a sense of loss of direction
Strong motivation, empowerment and job
satisfaction for employees
Some employees may feel unsettled by the
freedom of this style
Good environment for encouraging creativity
and innovation
Does not suit employees who are unskilled or
need structure and routine tasks
Conducive to teamwork
Decentralised and flatter business structure
encourages good communication, as ideas are
openly discussed
ACTIVITY 3.2
1 Identify potential workplaces where a laissez-faire management style would not work
particularly well.
2 Explain how a laissez-faire style might suit employees who work well in both team and
autonomous work situations.
Contingency or situational management approach
Business environments (external and internal) are constantly changing, including innovations in
product development and fast delivery of goods. Businesses need to respond to these changes
in order to compete against other businesses, and this can then impact on the management
style adopted by the manager. In a contingency (situational) management approach,
managers must take into account all aspects of the current external and internal circumstances
and act on those aspects that are important to the situation that has arisen. The manager
demonstrates flexibility in these circumstances, which is a response known as ‘contingency
approach’. It benefits the business because it provides the potential for managers to learn

This approach works by applying a range of variables to assist in selecting the most appropriate
management style for managing a given situation. The following are considered:
•
•
•
•
•
the manager’s personality, characteristics or qualities, their values and skills, and how they
communicate with staff
their subordinates’ (employees’) characteristics, such as their level of knowledge, skills,
experience and values
the tasks that need to be completed by the team or business – are they complex, simple or
repetitive?
the constraints, such as time, money and resource availability
the corporate culture of the business and the relationships between management and staff.
As a result of various forces or situations, managers may not use any one particular
management style. Rather, a manager could use a variety of management styles as outlined in
the following situations:
•
•
An authoritarian style would be appropriate where there are a number of new and unskilled
employees who need to learn a job. The manager would need to keep tight control of the
situation and teach the new employees what their job entails in as short a time as possible in
order for them to become productive.
The participative management style would best suit the project manager of a group
of experienced, motivated employees working as a project team who are capable of
accomplishing the project objectives within the established time frame.

In August 2021, Richard Murray, formerly CEO
of JB Hi-Fi, took over as CEO of Premier Retail
from Mark McInnes, who had held the CEO
position for the previous 10 years.
$2.17. Under Murray’s leadership, a 25-fold
increase in the share price occurred, with a
share’s value now being in excess of $47.
Premier Retail owns a suite of retail brands and
chain stores that includes Just Jeans, Dotti,
Smiggle, Peter Alexander, Portmans, Jacqui E
and Jay Jays. Premier Retail trades from more
than 1200 stores located in seven countries. It
also has a wholesale and online presence.
Murray believes it is important to meet
regularly with his teams, undertake corridor
conversations, meet for coffee and make
connections while also getting out and visiting
the JB Hi-Fi and Good Guys stores.
When appointing Murray to the position of
CEO, Chairman of the Premier Retail board,
Solomon Lew, described him as ‘one of the
best retailers in Australia’, having delivered
significant growth, transformation and
shareholder value during his career at JB Hi-Fi
Group.
Murray’s success as a leader can be recognised
by his financial achievements at JB Hi-Fi. When
listed on the ASX in 2003, one share was worth

COVID-19 pandemic confirmed the business
was able to transform its operations quickly.
Stores were converted into dark stores to fulfil
online orders, and an internal delivery system
was launched where store staff delivered online
orders to customers’ homes in a fleet of 75 hire
cars and 25 vans. This initiative enabled JB Hi-
Fi to keep all Melbourne store staff employed
while meeting its 155 per cent spike in online
sales. It also meant that the business met its
objective of maintaining jobs, as people are its
number one asset.

ACTIVITY 3.3
For each of the following scenarios, propose an appropriate management style, describe its
characteristics and provide two reasons to justify your suggestion.
1 Ian is an experienced business analyst at a major bank. He has been appointed as project
manager of a team of four employees who have the task of developing and implementing
a new risk management policy. His team members have been drawn from a variety of
functional areas within the bank (e.g. retail banking, information technology, legal and
finance). All members of his team are highly skilled and knowledgeable and capable of
working unsupervised. Ian does, however, feel that final decisions must be checked by him
before they present the new risk management policy to senior management for approval
prior to implementation.
2 Safiya decided that she wanted to start up and run a social media company. At university
she had studied a double degree – Business Studies (majoring in Marketing) and Computer
Science. While working in casual jobs during her five years of study, she found that she did
not have sufficient start-up capital to fund the business. Safiya was aware of the growing
popularity of crowdfunding as a way to raise capital. She discussed her business idea with
a group of her fellow university students, who were excited by her idea and keen to join her
in this entrepreneurial venture.

Skills are the ability to do something well, gained through training and experience, in order to
achieve the required goal. A close relationship exists between management styles and skills,
with certain management styles placing greater emphasis on different skills.
In addition, effective management requires a manager of any business to be capable of
producing an outcome that meets or exceeds accepted ethical standards. In achieving the
outcome, the manager should not undertake activities that are against their deeply held
moral values.

management, finance, sales and marketing or technology support), managers will need to
possess a range of skills, such as:

Communication skills
A renowned management consultant and author, Peter Drucker, said: ‘Management is doing
things right; leadership is doing the right things.’ He believed that the most important thing
in communication is to hear what isn’t being said: ‘Unless commitment is made, there are only
promises and hopes; but no plans.’
Communication skills are essential, as managers must be able to clarify with employees
the tasks required to be undertaken and completed. The main forms of communication that
managers will be involved in are:
•
•
•
personal communication – which involves sharing information and understanding between
the manager and a subordinate or a small group or work team. It is estimated that managers
spend between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of their work time in conversation. Therefore, it is
extremely important that they are effective in their interpersonal communication.
internal organisational communication – where systems are used to inform and share
information with employees (internal stakeholders) of the business. For instance, an
organisational chart can be used by management to inform employees about how the
business is structured, its functional areas, chain of command and communication channels.
Policy and procedure manuals are also used to inform employees about the way that the
business conducts itself.
external operational communication – which occurs when managers need to communicate
with stakeholders external to the business. It involves transmitting information to customers,
suppliers, investors, shareholders (if a company) and the community.

Figure 3.6 Main forms of communication used by managers
To achieve the vision of the business, open communication is vital if a manager wishes to
gain employee involvement in the expression and development of ideas. Frustration, lack
of motivation, inadequate direction and poor feedback between management and its
subordinates can result from weak or restricted communication flow.
A manager will be required to use a variety of forms of communication, such as:
•
reading – managers need to be able to locate, understand and interpret written data and
information, such as letters, reports, emails, documents, policies, procedures, codes of
practice, contracts and graphs

•
•
writing – to express thoughts and ideas, information and messages through emails, word-
processing documents, manuals and reports
speaking – to communicate orally by talking to people individually or in groups (small
or large) to disseminate information and gain feedback. Listening to oral messages is an
essential form of communication as a manager receives, attends to, interprets and responds
to oral messages. If managers do not develop the skill of listening, they may not hear the
suggestions or information from the most valuable employees.
ACTIVITY 3.5
Scenario 1
Aussie Home Delivery is a food home delivery business that has supplied fresh dairy, meat,
bread, vegetables and fruit to homes on a weekly basis for the past 10 years. Its general manager
needs to advise its staff that, due to increased competition from the online ordering and delivery
facility now provided by the major food retailers, Aussie Home Delivery will need to close down
its business. This closure will result in all its valued staff being made redundant.
Scenario 2
Chen owns and operates a
bakery in a busy strip shopping
centre in suburban Melbourne.
The bakery operates seven
days a week, with baking staff
starting work at 4 a.m. each day.
The business employs three
qualified and very experienced
bakers, three apprentice bakers
and eight shop assistants. To
ensure that the business runs
smoothly, Chen needs to plan
to have sufficient basic supplies
(flour and yeast) and any special
ingredients, such as dried fruit,
nuts, salami, pineapple and
mushrooms, in stock so they can
prepare and bake their selection
of baked items for sale each day.
He must also make sure that
all equipment, such as ovens,
dough-making machinery and
refrigerators, is in working order.
Figure 3.7 The owner and staff at a busy bakery need to effectively communicate with all its
stakeholders.
Chen now works on a part-time basis and is planning to fully retire from the business in the
next couple of years. To ensure that the business still runs productively, he must communicate
with his staff on matters such as their days and hours of work. Additionally, at the end of trade
each day, he needs to be advised of the bakery’s daily sales and stock levels so that stock can
be replenished. Chen is aware that he must ensure that his staff are trained and understand
health and safety requirements, as the business is regularly visited by the local council health
inspectors. With the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become important that he ensures that all staff
wear their face masks and that they actively control the number of customers permitted into the
shop at any one time.
Read the above two scenarios and recommend the form(s) of communication that you believe
would be most effective. Justify your choice.

Delegation
Delegation is the process where formal authority is passed down the hierarchy of a business.
It can occur at all levels and types and sizes of business. For example, a senior manager will
delegate to middle management, who will then delegate further down the chain of command
to front-line managers, who will then instruct the workers in their tasks. In a small business,
it may occur when the owner of a shoe shop authorises (delegates to) the floor staff to take
delivery of the newly arrived stock, check that all stock stated on the delivery note is exactly
what has been delivered, price the stock and then display it on the shelves ready for sale.
The authority to delegate needs to come right from the top of the business. If the business is a
company, then the shareholders, upon electing the board of directors, assign to them the right
or power to delegate to the chief executive officer and senior management the running of the
business. If the business is a sole trader or partnership, the authority will come from the owner
or partners.
Analysis: determine the tasks to be delegated
Appointment: nominate subordinate to
whom task is to be allocated
Briefing: define the task to be delegated
Control: monitor and encourage person

Appraisal: review and revise

responsibility

position or job

accountability the
extent to which

managers for

or performance
The acceptance of authority by a person indicates their acceptance of responsibility and
accountability. Responsibility remains with the manager or person to whom it is assigned, and
the only way that manager or person can be released from that responsibility is if a superior
takes it away.
If authority is retained by senior management or the business owner and not delegated, it is
said to be centralised, whereas authority passed down to the lower levels of the business is said
to be decentralised.
While delegation is a skill in itself, it is also a process that requires other skills to make it
effective, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the ability to analyse a job and have a clear understanding of what authority is required to
carry out the various parts of the job
the ability to establish performance standards
the ability to set realistic checkpoints and deadlines for tasks
the ability to select appropriate people to perform the delegated tasks
good communication skills
the ability to assess completed delegated tasks and provide feedback, in the form of praise
or further advice, to subordinates.

Benefits of delegation
Assists in the smooth flow of
production and work processes,
as work will continue even in
the absence of the owner or
manager
Acts as a time-saver, freeing
management to be involved in
longer-term planning and
more important tasks
Figure 3.9 Benefits of delegation
Not all tasks and actions to be undertaken by management are suitable for delegation.
Table 3.10 identifies some of those tasks that are suited to delegation and others where
delegation would be ill-advised.
Table 3.10 Examples of tasks suited to and not suited to delegation
Provides an opportunity for skill
training, personal development
and job satisfaction

employees’ abilities
Tasks suited to delegation Tasks not suited to delegation
Tasks that form part of a larger project Strategic planning
Repetitive or time-consuming tasks High-risk decisions
The collection or organisation of data High-cost decisions
Training and development of subordinates Confidential matters
Highly specialised areas requiring specific
training
Similarly, not all managers or business owners are good at delegating. There may be a variety of
reasons for this, including:
•
insecurity or fear that the subordinate to whom they have delegated a task may let
them down
•
feeling threatened that it might show up their inadequacies if the subordinate does too
good a job
•
being too disorganised or inflexible in how they organise their own work
•
being focused too heavily on the short-term achievement of work deadlines and therefore
thinking it is quicker to do the job themselves
•
a lack of trust and faith in their subordinates’ abilities
•
a desire for their own power and therefore being reluctant to relinquish authority as it might
make them feel less important
•
subordinates lacking confidence, training or experience or perhaps not wanting to accept
responsibility for any delegated tasks.

Planning
Planning is described as a decision-making process that is future-oriented. It involves
understanding the purpose or mission of a business and formulating the various levels of
objectives for the business. Factors drawn from various levels of the business environment can
cause uncertainty for a business. Undertaking planning assists a business to reduce these levels
of uncertainty. Steps in the planning process are outlined in Table 3.11.

ACTIVITY 3.6
The principal and school council of your school are looking at the strategic direction of the
school. As important stakeholders of the school, they would like you to apply your knowledge to
undertake a SWOT analysis of the school. The results of this analysis will assist school council to
formulate the strategic plans for the school. This activity can be undertaken as an individual or
class task.
Planning is generally ‘organised’ in a hierarchical structure,
with the overall direction coming from the top level of
a business. For a company, this is the board of directors
and senior management, while for a smaller business the
owner or business partners would represent this level.
Planning is categorised into three levels: strategic, tactical
and operational.
Strategic planning is the formal, long-term (two to
five years) planning process that establishes the overall
direction of the business. It is undertaken by the owner
of a small business or the senior management team of a
larger company. The planning decisions made at this level
will impact on the type of structure the business adopts,
and its values, business philosophies, strategic direction
and objectives.
Figure 3.12 Planning is essential for reducing uncertainty
in business.
Tactical planning is the formal, medium-term (one to two years) planning undertaken by
middle management to implement the strategic plan of the business. This level of planning
occurs within each department or functional area of a business and its aim is to bring the
objectives of the business into reality.
Operational planning is the lowest level of planning and relates to setting goals and creating
and implementing plans for small groups, teams or individual employees of a business. It
involves the planning of operations on a daily, monthly or up to one-year basis by front-line
managers or supervisors within the business. They will be making plans to achieve goals such
as increasing efficiency, reducing mistakes and reorganising or improving the work processes
of people within their work team. Planning at this level will relate to activities such as staffing
rosters, ordering of supplies and production output schedules.

Leading
Businesses, regardless of size, need managers to be able
to lead and control the business’s activities. A good leader
knows when to step in and when to step away and allow
talented people they have hired to achieve the business’s
future potential. Businesspeople, whether they are
entrepreneurs who founded a business or operators of
small and medium-sized businesses, need to understand
that if they cannot relinquish some control of their
business, its growth will be stunted and its full potential
never realised.

Leading involves influencing others towards attaining the objectives of the business. Effective
leading requires a manager to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
establish conditions that motivate, engage and inspire subordinates
be a good communicator
act as a role model who is creative, curious, humble, caring and trustworthy, and uses power
effectively
understand those whom they are going to lead: their personalities, values, attitudes and
emotions
be able to build teams
inspire loyalty, dedication and commitment in those they lead
resolve conflicts
act as a mentor
be able to respond quickly and appropriately to change and help others to do the same.

(EI) the ability

Learning to lead takes time, and it can be assisted by understanding the theory of emotional
intelligence (EI). In 2002, Daniel Goleman, a psychologist, helped develop this theory. The
relationship between being effective in leading and emotional intelligence is very close. When
leading, a manager needs to ensure that tasks are completed successfully and the team of
subordinates under their control is kept together. In addition, they must ensure that each
individual in that team is happy and contributing on an individual basis to the successful
outcome of the team.
The EI theory incorporates a set of competencies that allows a manager to perceive, understand
and regulate emotions in themselves and in others. For a manager to be judged as having
excellent leadership skills, attending to the competencies outlined in Table 3.12 would be
essential.
Table 3.12 Five competencies linked to excellent leadership skills
Essential competencies Explanation
Emotional self-awareness Knowing what one is feeling at any given time and understanding
the impact those moods have on others
Self-regulation Controlling or redirecting one’s emotions, anticipating
consequences before acting on impulse
Motivation Utilising emotional factors to achieve goals, enjoying the learning
process and persevering in the face of obstacles
Empathy Sensing the emotions of others
Social skills Managing relationships, inspiring others and inducing desired
responses from them
Businesses function more effectively when they operate as a team. These teams may occur at
various levels; for instance, the senior management team establishes the strategic direction
for the business. Within any business there will be project teams and natural work groups. It
is important that team leadership skills are exhibited by the team leader, whether leading a
project team or a work group, to ensure the success of the team in achieving their objectives.

Teamwork is best understood as a set of behaviours that two or more people demonstrate
when working on some common task or pursuing a common objective. Employees are more
likely to share the vision and objectives of a business if they participate as a team, particularly in
the problem-solving and the decision-making processes. When people listen carefully to each
other, seek and take seriously each other’s opinions, and make use of each other’s competencies
and expertise, they are involved in teamwork. Teamwork encourages open communication,
improves morale, workplace cooperation and productivity, and develops a positive corporate
culture. Team leadership skills are therefore important for a manager to be able to guide and
direct this powerful business tool: teams.

and then sticking to their convictions
•
that they are a strategic thinker and happy to be around for a long time and deal with
big issues
•
that they demonstrate a high level of transparency, meaning they share information
with their staff, are trustworthy and able to communicate, and are willing to be
accountable for their actions
•
that they are accessible, friendly and welcoming even though they are very busy people.

Decision-making
In the day-to-day operations of a business, a manager or business owner can be faced with
numerous problems they need to overcome and decisions they need to make resulting from
changes in the macro, operating and internal environments. Some of these decisions will in
fact be routine and not require much deliberation. In other cases, decision-making may be
more difficult or complex and require more time and thought to be put into the process before
arriving at the final decision. These are the sorts of decisions that involve the factors outlined in
Table 3.13.

Complexity A number of interrelated factors need consideration
High-risk consequences Resulting from the outcome of the decision

Possible alternatives Choices to be reviewed are numerous
Using a systematic process when trying to reach a decision reduces the likelihood of overlooking
important factors that should be considered. Outlined in Table 3.14 is a six-step process for effective
decision-making. The decision-making skill requires managers to recognise problems and then
become resourceful in seeking help from others to think critically, creatively and reflectively, and
to adapt to alternative solutions. Managers who undertake this process understand that a quick
solution will not work to resolve a complex issue. They spend time analysing the problem from all
angles and are open and honest in communicating with those involved.

Steps Explanation
1  Identify the problem and
define the objectives
Be sure to identify and define the actual problem or issue needing resolution
2  Gather the necessary
information to establish
the cause of the problem
Investigate the circumstances surrounding the issue and search for factors that may
have created the problem. Once all the information is gathered, reassess the problem
to see if it is the same.

3  Develop alternative
solutions
The existence of some choice is necessary for effective decision-making. Develop
creative and imaginative possible solutions to the problem. However, retaining the
status quo is always one alternative.
4 Analyse the alternatives Rank and sort the different alternatives. Each alternative must be evaluated in terms
of its strengths and weaknesses, benefits, costs, advantages and disadvantages in
achieving objectives of the team, department or business.
5  Choose an alternative and
implement it
Management needs to decide the best outcome, given the conditions under which the
decision has to be made. Management must communicate clearly the decision that has
been taken, the required results and personnel associated with its implementation.
6  Evaluate the
implementation
Provide feedback on progress, making the necessary adjustments. Evaluation enables
managers to learn from experience and improve their further decision-making and
problem-solving skills.

In some cases, the decision-making process may reflect
a strong team involvement at the discussion stage of the

depends largely on the complexity of the issue, the leader’s
management style and the structure of the business.

Scenario
Oaktree is a nursery operating in regional Victoria. The business has been run by horticulturalist
Andrew and his wife Jacqueline for 15 years. Over the years, they have built up the business and are
well known in the area for the quality of their plants and also for the advice they give to gardeners.
They now need to decide whether to keep the business as a nursery or broaden its operation to
include a cafe where people can come and enjoy meals throughout the day. Jacqueline is happy
to be responsible for running that side of the business. She believes that by opening the cafe they
will attract not only locals but also ‘day-trippers’ as their town is only 90 minutes from Melbourne.
Operating as both a garden centre and a cafe will provide Oaktree with dual income streams;
however, consideration needs to be given to the cost involved in setting up this new venture.
Task
The owners of Oaktree, Andrew and Jacqueline, have asked you to assist them to decide whether they
should undertake this new venture. Demonstrate your understanding of decision-making by including
the theoretical steps of the decision-making process as well as linking each step to the scenario.

Interpersonal
Interpersonal skills are those skills used by a manager when dealing with people on a
personal basis, such as being able to lead, motivate, communicate, manage conflict and build
team rapport.
As mentioned in the section on leading, emotional intelligence forms an important component
of a manager’s tool set in applying interpersonal skills. It is recognised that there are some core
interpersonal skills, such as the ability to be:
interpersonal
skills those skills
used every day
to communicate
and interact with
other people,
both individually
and in groups
•
•
•
•
•
a team player and to work effectively with others, both in the internal and external
environments of the business
both empathic (understanding a situation from another’s point of view) and assertive (being
able to state your own requirements)
a good communicator
able to motivate and encourage others
ethical, honest and able to respect the values,
beliefs, aspirations and contributions of others.
For interpersonal relations to be maintained on
a positive level, managers need to be able to
manage conflict with stakeholders (both internal
and external). Often conflict can arise through
differences in the expectations, goals, needs and
wants of the manager and their subordinates.
A manager may want something to be done;
however, their subordinates want something else.
Should the manager adopt an aggressive, win-
at-any-cost approach? Alternatively, is it better
to adopt an assertive yet collaborative approach,
where both parties to the conflict can gain a
win? Adopting the second approach can turn the
potential area of conflict into one of agreement
between the parties.

on all levels.

The relationship between management
styles and management skills
Learning intentions – at the
end of this chapter section I
will be able to:
3.3.1 Identify and describe the relationship between
management styles and management skills
It is important that businesses have tools in place to be able to evaluate whether the
management style and skills adopted by a particular manager were appropriate when
managing a range of business situations.
Outlined in Table 3.15 are a range of situations where managers would need to determine
which management style, and related skills, was appropriate for the given situation. It is also
important to assess the effectiveness of a manager in their role in terms of managing both the
tasks to be completed and the staff for whom they are responsible.
Table 3.15 Areas of assessment of a manager’s effectiveness
Area Style Skill
Outcomes/results based
on objectives
Did the manager adopt an appropriate style
to ensure that the outcomes were reached
in an ethical manner? Was the style chosen
focused on task achievement?
Communication – was it open?
Decision-making – centralised or
decentralised?
Delegating tasks – did it occur and were
the tasks appropriate?
Planning – appropriate levels?
Leading – did any conflict arise?
Interpersonal – were good relationships
established and managed?
Relationship with
external/internal
environment
Was the correct (appropriate) management
style adopted to manage the given situation?
Were the appropriate skills adopted (e.g.
communication, interpersonal, decision-
making)?
Communication Did the style chosen permit appropriate
communication flow?
Communication flow – was it downward,
upward, lateral or open?
Motivation and job
satisfaction of staff
Was the management style chosen
appropriate to ensure that workers
(subordinates) were motivated to
achieve? Were the correct motivational
strategies implemented?
Were the tasks delegated by the manager
appropriate? Did the manager lead the
subordinates adequately, so creating a
good relationship between the manager
and the subordinates?
Level of teamwork within
the business
Did the style chosen encourage this
approach?
Did the manager show team leadership?
What level of decentralised decision-
making occurred?
Staff absenteeism and
staff turnover (i.e. level of
staff satisfaction)
How did the level of staff absenteeism
compare with other business units within
the business and industry (in general)?
What skills were implemented to create a
harmonious and productive workplace?
Training and development
opportunities for staff
Did the style chosen encourage staff training
and development?
Did the manager make available and
oversee these areas for staff development?
Performance appraisal Was the management style appropriate for
ensuring that employees could demonstrate
their strengths and assist them to overcome
any weaknesses?
Communication – was it open and did it
encourage honesty by all parties?

Luigi Bocca is the owner and chief executive officer of an independent boutique supermarket
called Bocca located in one of Melbourne’s trendy inner suburbs. His shop is designed to cater
to the needs of the growing number of people living in inner-city apartments as well as people
still living in homes that they have owned for the last 20 or 30 years. To meet the changing
requirements of his customers, Luigi is now stocking a vast range of organic products alongside
the traditional offerings of fresh meat, fish, delicatessen products, bread, fruit and vegetables.
He also offers a wide range of ‘grab and go’ foods such as sandwiches, salads and sushi, and
ready-to-eat meals such as lasagne, ravioli, beef and lamb casseroles and curries with rice.
The trading hours of Bocca are 8 a.m. until 9 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and 10 a.m. until 7 p.m.
on Sunday.
Luigi opened Bocca in the early 1990s and since then the sales revenue of the business has been
steadily increasing. He also expanded the size of the store to now have a large retail footprint.
Luigi is now starting to think about reducing his working hours and ultimately entering his
retirement. He would like to spend more time travelling within Australia and back to Italy with
his wife Louisa. To make this transition happen, he knows that he needs to start sharing his
management role with other staff members, thus expanding the current management team,
which is made up of his daughter Annabel in the role of finance manager and accountant, his
eldest son Joseph in charge of the store’s IT systems, and his youngest son Alberto, who is the
operations manager.

The store employs 20 full-time staff who have worked at Bocca since its opening. These
employees have a very good understanding of how the business operates and act as
supervisors for the casual staff. Many of the full-time staff are advancing in age and are also
thinking of transitioning to retirement and will need to be replaced. The remaining members of
staff work on a casual basis. Some are students whose work rosters are arranged around their
study commitments at university or TAFE. Others are local people (male and female) who want
to work hours that fit around their family commitments.

There are several different types of business ownership and legal structures.
A public sector business is owned by government.
A private sector business is owned by individuals.
The most common legal structures for businesses are:
— sole trader
—
— partnership
—
— company.
—
There are two types of company:
— private limited
—
— public listed.
—
A company is a separate legal entity to its owners/shareholders, who enjoy
the benefits of limited liability.
Social enterprises exist to pursue social and/or environmental goals.
Government business enterprises are government-owned (public sector)
enterprises that have adopted a corporate model.

All businesses must establish aims or objectives.
Objectives should be set using the SMART principle.
Business objectives can be to make a profit, to increase market share, to
improve efficiency, to improve effectiveness, to fulfil a market need, to fulfil
a social need and to meet shareholder expectations.
Vision and mission statements are important for all businesses.
A values statement allows a business to focus on what is important in the
business related to its shared values and cultural priorities.
Stakeholders have expectations regarding the performance of a business.
It is important for businesses to continually revisit objectives and look at
ways to improve their other objectives.

Key knowledge Summary
•
Management
styles, including
autocratic, persuasive,
consultative,
participative and
laissez-faire
•
•
•
•
Management style is the approach used to provide direction, implement
plans and motivate people.
There are a variety of management styles: autocratic, persuasive,
consultative, participative and laissez-faire.
The contingency or situational management approach applies a range of
variables that can be used to determine the appropriate style for a given set
of circumstances.
The variables are the nature of the task, the time frame, the level of experience
of the employees, any constraints (such as money or resources), the corporate
culture of the business and finally the preferred style of the manager.
•
The appropriateness
of management
styles in relation to
the nature of the task,
time, experience
of employees and
manager preference
•
The styles vary according to a range of characteristics. First, their degree of
centralisation relating to authority and decision-making. Second, the focus
or orientation they adopt, whether task achievement is of greater importance
than having satisfied employees or a combination of both. Third, their
belief in what acts to motivate employees: is it money or challenging and
interesting tasks? Fourth, the attitude of the manager to their subordinates:
do they believe they need to be directed in everything they do or do they
actually have trust and faith in their ability? Finally, the communication flow
differs between the styles, varying from closed (downward) to a totally open
flow in the participative style.
•
Management
skills, including
communication,
delegation, planning,
leading, decision-
making and
interpersonal
•
•
Management skills are the abilities or expertise required by a manager to
achieve their work.
A range of skills is required by managers regardless of their level in the
management hierarchy: communication, delegation, planning, leading,
decision-making and interpersonal.
•
The relationship
between management
styles and management
skills
•
The interrelationship that exists between management styles and skills
provides an opportunity for assessing whether management is effective.
•
Corporate culture, both
official and real
•
•
•
•
•
Corporate culture is an internal factor that management seeks to influence
with a view to optimisation of business performance.
Corporate culture refers to the shared values and beliefs of people within a
business.
Official corporate culture refers to the set of values and beliefs desired by
the management of a business.
Real/unofficial culture refers to the culture that actually prevails in a business.
The following factors are keys to developing the desired corporate culture
within a business organisation:
— mission, vision and values statements
—
— management structure
—
— management style
—
— policies and procedures
—
— business documentation and forms of communication used
—
— the people within the business
—
— the physical environment and material symbols within the business
—
— stories, narratives and rituals shared within the business.
—

Sample examination questions and advice
Unit 3 Area of Study 1: Business foundations
In this Area of Study, students are introduced to the key characteristics of businesses and their
stakeholders. They investigate potential conflicts between the different demands of stakeholders on a
business. Corporate culture and a range of management styles and skills that may be used when managing
a business are also examined and applied to contemporary business case studies from the past four years.
Outcome 1 requires students to be able to analyse the key characteristics of businesses, their
stakeholders, management styles and skills, and their corporate culture.
Question 1
Mick and Richard are partners in Leaf Inventions. They have decided that, rather than continuing to
operate in their current legal structure of a partnership, they will incorporate their business and form
a company. They are, however, uncertain whether to incorporate to become a private limited or public
listed company.
Discuss the implications for the business, Leaf Inventions, if its owners decide to become a private
company rather than being publicly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. (4 marks)

A possible answer to Question 1 might be:
Sample response
By adopting the legal structure of a company, regardless of whether private limited or public
listed, Mick and Richard will gain certain advantages. One important implication related to
adopting either form of company structure is that it provides Mick and Richard (as shareholders)
the protection of creating a separate legal entity and therefore limiting their liability for any
debts incurred by the business. It also provides them with perpetuity (ongoing life) for their
business. Establishing the business as a public listed company will, however, provide greater
opportunity for Leaf Inventions to raise capital through having the ability to have a larger
number of shareholders in the business, as it will be listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.
While both forms of company structure must ensure that they adhere to legal and compliance
requirements, these are less onerous and less costly for a private limited company.
Marking guide:
•
No marks for a response that only defines the characteristics of a company
•
2–3 marks for a response that states and discusses arguments covering both forms of
company structure
•
To gain full marks (4 marks), you will need to state and discuss arguments covering implications for
adopting both forms of company structure and include reference to the stimulus material (i.e. Mick
and Richard and Leaf Inventions).
Question 2
Mick and Richard, owners of Leaf Inventions, have decided to become a private limited company.

that may arise due to the changed legal structure of the business. (4 marks)

Identify relevant stakeholders to the business.
Choose two stakeholders and describe their interest. (Remember, there are many stakeholders for
a business – owners, managers, employees, customers, suppliers and the general community.)
Determine any potential areas of conflict.
A possible answer to Question 2 might be:
Sample response
Two stakeholders, being either an individual or a group, who have a vested interest in the
activities of Leaf Inventions are firstly its shareholders, who would be looking for the business to
be profitable and to provide dividends to them based on their shareholding. An area of conflict
could arise when Mick and Richard, who are now shareholders, want to retain funds within the
business to assist with its future growth, whereas the other shareholders (owners) would like to
receive a large dividend yield on their investment.
A second stakeholder to the business is the government, which wants to ensure that
the company is correctly registered, is paying the correct forms of taxation, is making
superannuation contributions on behalf of its staff and is compliant with any specific regulations
relating to operating a company. Conflict may arise between the company and the government
if any of the above requirements are not adequately met or are breached.
Marking guide:
•
1 mark for identifying two relevant stakeholders
•
2 marks for description of two relevant stakeholders and nature of interest
•
3–4 marks for description of two relevant stakeholders, nature of interest and possible areas of
conflict.
Question 3
Mick is chief finance officer and Richard is operations manager of Leaf Inventions Pty Ltd. It is the
aim of the business to enter a period of growth, and to achieve this they have each agreed the most
appropriate management style for them to adopt is consultative.

•
This question has multiple parts (management styles and skills) and requires all parts to be
completed to gain full marks.
There are a range of other skills that could be identified and justified, including delegation,
leadership, decision-making and interpersonal.
A possible answer to Question 3a might be:
Sample response
The consultative management style is characterised by the manager exercising centralised
control and authority while taking account of the ideas and concepts provided by employees,
particularly in relation to making decisions. The manager considers task achievement to be an
important factor, but also understands the importance of the ‘people factor’, which results in
employees becoming more motivated and wanting to perform to their best.
Two management skills that would be important are communication and planning.
Communication that is open and encourages discussion and feedback would be essential.
It would be in the form of top-down information and directions by management (Mick
and Richard) to employees (subordinates) related to their growth plans. Upward flow of
communication from the employees to management would then be able to provide valuable
options and feedback relating to expansion plans.
Planning is a skill that relates to future-oriented decision-making. It involves understanding
the purpose or aims of the business, then formulating various levels of objectives, plans and
strategies to meet the desired outcome. This skill is therefore important if Mick and Richard wish
to embark on a growth strategy for their business.
Marking guide:
•
2 marks for describing the key characteristics of the consultative style
•
3 marks for identifying and justifying two management skills that relate to growing the business.

Hint:
•
Requires breaking the style into parts and examining the relationship of this style to
corporate culture.
A possible answer to Question 3b might be:
Sample response
Corporate culture relates to the shared values and beliefs held within a business. By adopting
a consultative management style, Mick and Richard are demonstrating that they want to set
the approach the business will be taking, as they wish to remain in control of its operations,
its communication flow and therefore its official culture. However, by adopting this style they
demonstrate that they value their employees and wish them to be motivated and contribute to
the success of the business.
Marking guide:
•
To gain full marks, students need to establish the impact of characteristics of the style on the
corporate culture of the business.

TARGET: Basic recall and recognition.
TEST: Can student retrieve relevant knowledge from memory?
QUESTION TYPES: Define terms, identify components, recall facts, match definitions.
STEMS: "What is...", "Which of the following is...", "The term for... is...", "Identify the..."
AVOID: Application, inference, or synthesis. Test recognition, not deeper understanding.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can identify and name the five management styles on the continuum from task-oriented to people-oriented
CODE: 3.1.1

WHAT (concept explanation):
The five management styles are autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire. They sit on a continuum from task-oriented (autocratic) to people-oriented (laissez-faire).

WHY (importance):
Recognising where each style sits on the continuum helps you quickly compare them and understand their underlying philosophy.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
If asked to arrange styles from most to least centralised, the order would be: autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative, laissez-faire.

SUBTOPIC: Management Styles
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the five management styles — autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire — and their key characteristics. It examines how each style differs in terms of control, communication, decision-making and employee orientation.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the distinct features of each management style is essential for analysing how businesses are run. Being able to identify and describe these styles is a foundational skill tested in SACs and exams.

TOPIC: Management styles and skills
SUBJECT: Business Management | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: An exploration of the five management styles, six management skills, and the relationship between them in achieving business objectives.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW
Managing a business of any size can be a complex and challenging
task for the business’s owners and managers. The majority of
businesses will establish as one of their main objectives ‘growing the
value of the business’. The leaders or senior managers of that business
must set a clear vision and be able to continually communicate the
vision. Their role is to then get out of the way and let the second-line
managers do their job. The choice of management style and skills
adopted by these managers will differ. Ideally, the style and skills
adopted should be appropriate to the situation within the business.

management
style the manner
and approach
of providing
direction,

people
A management style, broadly speaking, is the manner and approach of providing direction,
implementing plans and motivating people that is adopted by a manager. There are distinctly
different styles of management: autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire.
Management styles can have specific features. For example, the way managers interact with
employees will depend on how they exercise authority, the degree of task or employee
orientation, and the manner of communication (‘top-down’, ‘bottom-up’ or lateral). The type of
management structure adopted by the business in order to achieve its goals and objectives,
such as bureaucratic (multilayered), a flatter structure or a team-based structure, will also
impact on the style chosen.
Most managers use a range of styles based on the situation that is required to be managed, their
own (manager’s) personality, the characteristics of their subordinates and any time constraints.
For instance, if a manager wanted to introduce 12-hour shifts to raise productivity by increasing
the utilisation of expensive plant and equipment, it is unlikely that an autocratic task-oriented
style would be effective in managing this situation. A participative or consultative management
style, where employee input was sought and considered before making a decision, would be
more appropriate.
Management styles can be demonstrated using a continuum of management approaches
based on their orientation towards the task or employees/people. At one end of the continuum,
the importance of the task outweighs that of the employees/people. The other end places
greater importance on the people, while not forgetting the importance of task achievement.

Types of management style
Management style refers to the different ways in which managers behave. The preferred style
of a manager will depend on many factors, such as cultural styles of leadership and the type
of business.
Autocratic management style
Autocratic management style (authoritarian) is often referred to as the classical
management style.
The characteristics of the autocratic management style are outlined in Table 3.1.
Table 3.1 The characteristics of the autocratic management style
Characteristic Description
Control and authority autocratic
management
style
(authoritarian)
management
style where all
decision-making
is centralised,
there is little
delegated
authority and
communication
is one-way –
downwards
Managers want to be in control and retain authority, particularly
when undertaking planning, coordinating and monitoring various
human and physical activities of the business. They want to be the
main person guiding employees towards achieving the objectives
of the business.
Task-oriented Great importance is placed on achieving the task and following
established process. Policies and procedures are maintained in
detail and enforced by frequent checks.
Motivating factor Main motivator for work performance is payment (i.e. money)
Decision-making Centralised and controlled by the manager with decision or
orders then passed on or told to subordinates
Employees’ contribution Little value is placed on the importance of the employees’
contribution to the overall performance of the business. The
objectives, aims and operating environments reflect the ideas,
beliefs and values of the manager.
Communication Centralised with a strict top-down or hierarchical chain-of-
command approach to management
centralised

those below it
in a hierarchy;
communication

and worker
participation in
decision-making
is non-existent
An autocratic manager has a high regard for production and efficiency (task-oriented).
Managers expect team members to comply with their decisions and they are not concerned
with the attitude or thinking of the group. This can result in passive resistance from team
members, which requires the manager to then apply continual pressure and direction in
order to get things done. If this style is adopted by the CEO of a business, it can result in high-
potential employees and even members of the senior management team walking out the door
because their ideas and views are not being heard. Managers adopting this style often use
punishment and rewards to achieve their objectives.

Table 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages of an autocratic management style
Advantages Disadvantages
Decision-making is quick, as only one person
needs to be involved
A quick decision is not always the best
decision
Decisions are made by an experienced leader Discourages teamwork; employees’ opinions
and input are not sought
Communication is direct Does not allow for open communication and
feedback on ideas
Roles and expectations of employees are
defined and monitored
Low motivation and job satisfaction, as
workers are not empowered; staff turnover
may increase when staff feel undervalued
High regard for production and efficiency Too task-focused, with insufficient regard for
employees as people with needs; does not
take account of needs of generations X and Y
and baby boomer employees
Suits high-risk or difficult decisions (e.g.
closure of business operations, retrenchment
of staff)
Creates feelings of unease and being ‘kept
in the dark’; can create a ‘them’ versus
‘us’ attitude
One industry that focuses on results and efficiency as being paramount is hospitality – in
particular, restaurants. Diners expect to receive timely, orderly service and quality food, while
restaurants are generally being run on slim margins, relying heavily on positive reviews and
return customers. Their business will suffer even from small mistakes. In the kitchen, it can be
the head chef adopting all the characteristics of an autocratic manager, ordering and ruling over
the kitchen staff with an iron hand. One extreme example is renowned chef Gordon Ramsay.
The maître d’hôtel responsible for the waiting staff will often also adopt this style.
ACTIVITY 3.1
Describe how you might feel if you were an employee under the management of an
autocratic manager. Explain how these feelings may disrupt or even aid your ability to be a
productive employee.

Persuasive management style
A persuasive management style is that of a manager who uses their ability to interpret
a situation, people’s actions and dialogue, and then strongly urges or convinces them to
do a task or achieve objectives the manager’s way. This style has many characteristics in
common with the autocratic style. The main difference between the styles, however, is
that once a persuasive manager makes a decision, they then try to convince a subordinate
that what was decided by the manager is in the subordinate’s best interests. For example,
a marketing department manager who has an idea for increasing sales targets will try to
convince the rest of the marketing team that only their idea will improve the sales targets.

This type of manager will try to bring people around to their own view, while sticking to
their decision with or without agreement. Under this type of management style, employees
will have a better idea of what to do when there is a change externally or internally,
because the manager has explained their intentions.
The characteristics of the persuasive management style are outlined in Table 3.3.
Table 3.3 The characteristics of the persuasive management style
Characteristic Description
Control and authority Centralised
Task-oriented Great importance on achieving the task and following the established
process. The manager ensures that policies and procedures are
maintained in detail and enforced by frequent checks.
Motivating factor Believes that payment (money) for tasks performed is the main
motivator for work performance
Decision-making Centralised or controlled by management, with the decision or order
then explained or presented to subordinates
Employees’ contribution Some value placed on contribution of employees to overall
performance of the business. The objectives, aims and operating
environments still, however, reflect the ideas, beliefs and values of
the manager.
Communication Centralised, with a strict top-down or hierarchical chain-of-command
approach to management
Table 3.4 Advantages and disadvantages of a persuasive management style
Advantages Disadvantages
Decision-making is quick and still made by
one person
No input from workers into decision-making
process; undervalues benefits of teamwork
Suits high-risk decisions (e.g. closure of
factory, redundancies)
Workers can still feel alienated, as their
opinions are not sought
Employees have a clear idea about what they
have to do and achieve
Opportunities for employee initiative and
commitment overlooked, leading to low levels
of motivation and job satisfaction

consultative
management
style manager
consults with

the ultimate
decision is made

based on the
suggestions and
input received
Consultative management style
A consultative management style takes into
account the opinions of team members before
making a decision. This style is moving further
along the continuum from being purely task-
centred to taking the people/employees more
into account. For example, a school principal
may ask the student leadership group, parents
and staff for their suggestions on a new uniform,
then consider all the arguments and make a
decision on the type of uniform that will be
introduced. Another example is when a team
leader of a project holds weekly meetings with
the team members where they are given the
opportunity to share progress of their job tasks
and responsibilities. The meetings allow team
members the opportunity to provide feedback
on areas needing improvement. The team leader
can then use this feedback to review and set
schedules, allocate resources and prioritise tasks
and goals for the coming week.
The characteristics of the consultative
management style are outlined in Table 3.5.
Figure 3.2 A consultative manager seeks input from
their staff.
Table 3.5 The characteristics of the consultative management style
Characteristic Description
Control and authority Centralised and exercised by the manager. More employee-based
and less centralised than autocratic and persuasive styles. Ideas and
concepts provided by employees.
Task achievement Important driving factor, balancing with understanding of ‘people
factor’
Motivating factor Reasonable level of employee involvement, resulting in more
motivated employees wanting to perform at their best. Values

Advantages Disadvantages
Gain a variety of ideas from the suggestions
of employees, which will lead to a better
decision-making outcome
Employees may not understand the
complexity of the problem being discussed
Reasonable level of employee involvement Time-consuming if many stakeholders are
consulted
Acts to motivate and increase an employee’s
level of job satisfaction
Employees may still not feel valued if they
have provided their ideas but these are
overlooked
Participative management style
The participative management style has become very popular because it focuses on the
interaction between management and employees. This style keeps employees informed about
issues that affect their work, with management and employees sharing in decision-making
and problem-solving tasks. The manager is now acting more as a coach who gets their team of
employees to work together to improve the overall performance of the business. The manager
does not delegate away responsibility, as they still are entitled to have the final say.
The characteristics of the participative management style are outlined in Table 3.7.
Table 3.7 The characteristics of the participative management style
Characteristic Description
Control and authority Decentralised approach. Corporate objectives, while determined
by senior management, are followed by setting departmental,

Table 3.8 Advantages and disadvantages of a participative management style
Advantages Disadvantages
Manager demonstrates trust and faith in the
ability of employees
Can give rise to conflict between employees
who question the ability of their co-workers
Employee morale is increased, as employees
feel part of the process of the business;
this leads to an increase in motivation and
productivity
Some workers would prefer to have their level
of productivity (output) linked to money rather
than job satisfaction
Employees feel a sense of ownership and
empowerment as they are now decision-
makers
Lack of contribution by all employees, as some
would rather not be involved in decision-
making, preferring to be told what to do
Decision-making, particularly at middle to
lower levels of the business, is improved
because employees are involved in making
decisions on actions directly related to
them. A diversity of viewpoints is evident
in discussions.

Shared vision and direction between

Laissez-faire management style
The laissez-faire management style can also be
called ‘free-rein’ or ‘hands-off’ style. It is a style in which
management provides little direction to employees.
Management’s involvement and responsibility often
relate to outlining budgetary constraints, coordinating
timelines and ensuring that broad corporate objectives
are achieved. Employees are then empowered to
determine their own objectives, solve their own
problems and make their own decisions.
Figure 3.3 Sharing creative and innovative ideas with team members
is an important characteristic of the laissez-faire management style.

Chapter 3 Management styles and skills

This style is commonly found in workplaces where the employees are highly educated, skilled
and experienced. This group of employees require little direction and have their own motivation
(drive) to accomplish, and take pride in their accomplishments. It is also found in businesses
that are in the ‘start-up’ phase or incubator phase of product development. Examples of
businesses where the laissez-faire management style could work well are advertising agencies,
product design firms, start-up social media businesses, and specialised engineering, medical
research or architectural businesses. For instance, a manager of a website development
company could entrust the website designers to work independently with little interference
from the manager when fulfilling the customer’s needs. Group members would be allowed to
perform as they like, so far as this does not violate the objectives and policies of the business,
and tasks are completed within budgets and agreed timelines. This style also suits the dynamic
nature of an advertising company where creative freedom is very important.
Table 3.9 Advantages and disadvantages of the laissez-faire management style
Advantages Disadvantages
High employee independence, as employees
can set their own tasks with little involvement
from management
Lack of guidance can cause some employees
to have a sense of loss of direction
Strong motivation, empowerment and job
satisfaction for employees
Some employees may feel unsettled by the
freedom of this style
Good environment for encouraging creativity
and innovation
Does not suit employees who are unskilled or
need structure and routine tasks
Conducive to teamwork
Decentralised and flatter business structure
encourages good communication, as ideas are
openly discussed
ACTIVITY 3.2
1 Identify potential workplaces where a laissez-faire management style would not work
particularly well.
2 Explain how a laissez-faire style might suit employees who work well in both team and
autonomous work situations.
Contingency or situational management approach
Business environments (external and internal) are constantly changing, including innovations in
product development and fast delivery of goods. Businesses need to respond to these changes
in order to compete against other businesses, and this can then impact on the management
style adopted by the manager. In a contingency (situational) management approach,
managers must take into account all aspects of the current external and internal circumstances
and act on those aspects that are important to the situation that has arisen. The manager
demonstrates flexibility in these circumstances, which is a response known as ‘contingency
approach’. It benefits the business because it provides the potential for managers to learn

This approach works by applying a range of variables to assist in selecting the most appropriate
management style for managing a given situation. The following are considered:
•
•
•
•
•
the manager’s personality, characteristics or qualities, their values and skills, and how they
communicate with staff
their subordinates’ (employees’) characteristics, such as their level of knowledge, skills,
experience and values
the tasks that need to be completed by the team or business – are they complex, simple or
repetitive?
the constraints, such as time, money and resource availability
the corporate culture of the business and the relationships between management and staff.
As a result of various forces or situations, managers may not use any one particular
management style. Rather, a manager could use a variety of management styles as outlined in
the following situations:
•
•
An authoritarian style would be appropriate where there are a number of new and unskilled
employees who need to learn a job. The manager would need to keep tight control of the
situation and teach the new employees what their job entails in as short a time as possible in
order for them to become productive.
The participative management style would best suit the project manager of a group
of experienced, motivated employees working as a project team who are capable of
accomplishing the project objectives within the established time frame.

In August 2021, Richard Murray, formerly CEO
of JB Hi-Fi, took over as CEO of Premier Retail
from Mark McInnes, who had held the CEO
position for the previous 10 years.
$2.17. Under Murray’s leadership, a 25-fold
increase in the share price occurred, with a
share’s value now being in excess of $47.
Premier Retail owns a suite of retail brands and
chain stores that includes Just Jeans, Dotti,
Smiggle, Peter Alexander, Portmans, Jacqui E
and Jay Jays. Premier Retail trades from more
than 1200 stores located in seven countries. It
also has a wholesale and online presence.
Murray believes it is important to meet
regularly with his teams, undertake corridor
conversations, meet for coffee and make
connections while also getting out and visiting
the JB Hi-Fi and Good Guys stores.
When appointing Murray to the position of
CEO, Chairman of the Premier Retail board,
Solomon Lew, described him as ‘one of the
best retailers in Australia’, having delivered
significant growth, transformation and
shareholder value during his career at JB Hi-Fi
Group.
Murray’s success as a leader can be recognised
by his financial achievements at JB Hi-Fi. When

Stores were converted into dark stores to fulfil
online orders, and an internal delivery system
was launched where store staff delivered online
orders to customers’ homes in a fleet of 75 hire
cars and 25 vans. This initiative enabled JB Hi-
Fi to keep all Melbourne store staff employed
while meeting its 155 per cent spike in online
sales. It also meant that the business met its
objective of maintaining jobs, as people are its

ACTIVITY 3.3
For each of the following scenarios, propose an appropriate management style, describe its
characteristics and provide two reasons to justify your suggestion.
1 Ian is an experienced business analyst at a major bank. He has been appointed as project
manager of a team of four employees who have the task of developing and implementing
a new risk management policy. His team members have been drawn from a variety of
functional areas within the bank (e.g. retail banking, information technology, legal and
finance). All members of his team are highly skilled and knowledgeable and capable of
working unsupervised. Ian does, however, feel that final decisions must be checked by him
before they present the new risk management policy to senior management for approval
prior to implementation.
2 Safiya decided that she wanted to start up and run a social media company. At university
she had studied a double degree – Business Studies (majoring in Marketing) and Computer
Science. While working in casual jobs during her five years of study, she found that she did
not have sufficient start-up capital to fund the business. Safiya was aware of the growing
popularity of crowdfunding as a way to raise capital. She discussed her business idea with
a group of her fellow university students, who were excited by her idea and keen to join her
in this entrepreneurial venture.

Skills are the ability to do something well, gained through training and experience, in order to
achieve the required goal. A close relationship exists between management styles and skills,
with certain management styles placing greater emphasis on different skills.
In addition, effective management requires a manager of any business to be capable of
producing an outcome that meets or exceeds accepted ethical standards. In achieving the
outcome, the manager should not undertake activities that are against their deeply held
moral values.

Communication skills
A renowned management consultant and author, Peter Drucker, said: ‘Management is doing
things right; leadership is doing the right things.’ He believed that the most important thing
in communication is to hear what isn’t being said: ‘Unless commitment is made, there are only
promises and hopes; but no plans.’
Communication skills are essential, as managers must be able to clarify with employees
the tasks required to be undertaken and completed. The main forms of communication that
managers will be involved in are:
•
•
•
personal communication – which involves sharing information and understanding between
the manager and a subordinate or a small group or work team. It is estimated that managers
spend between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of their work time in conversation. Therefore, it is
extremely important that they are effective in their interpersonal communication.
internal organisational communication – where systems are used to inform and share
information with employees (internal stakeholders) of the business. For instance, an
organisational chart can be used by management to inform employees about how the
business is structured, its functional areas, chain of command and communication channels.
Policy and procedure manuals are also used to inform employees about the way that the
business conducts itself.
external operational communication – which occurs when managers need to communicate
with stakeholders external to the business. It involves transmitting information to customers,
suppliers, investors, shareholders (if a company) and the community.

Figure 3.6 Main forms of communication used by managers
To achieve the vision of the business, open communication is vital if a manager wishes to
gain employee involvement in the expression and development of ideas. Frustration, lack
of motivation, inadequate direction and poor feedback between management and its
subordinates can result from weak or restricted communication flow.
A manager will be required to use a variety of forms of communication, such as:
•
reading – managers need to be able to locate, understand and interpret written data and
information, such as letters, reports, emails, documents, policies, procedures, codes of
practice, contracts and graphs

•
•
writing – to express thoughts and ideas, information and messages through emails, word-
processing documents, manuals and reports
speaking – to communicate orally by talking to people individually or in groups (small
or large) to disseminate information and gain feedback. Listening to oral messages is an
essential form of communication as a manager receives, attends to, interprets and responds
to oral messages. If managers do not develop the skill of listening, they may not hear the
suggestions or information from the most valuable employees.
ACTIVITY 3.5
Scenario 1
Aussie Home Delivery is a food home delivery business that has supplied fresh dairy, meat,
bread, vegetables and fruit to homes on a weekly basis for the past 10 years. Its general manager
needs to advise its staff that, due to increased competition from the online ordering and delivery
facility now provided by the major food retailers, Aussie Home Delivery will need to close down
its business. This closure will result in all its valued staff being made redundant.
Scenario 2
Chen owns and operates a
bakery in a busy strip shopping
centre in suburban Melbourne.
The bakery operates seven
days a week, with baking staff
starting work at 4 a.m. each day.
The business employs three
qualified and very experienced
bakers, three apprentice bakers
and eight shop assistants. To
ensure that the business runs
smoothly, Chen needs to plan
to have sufficient basic supplies
(flour and yeast) and any special
ingredients, such as dried fruit,
nuts, salami, pineapple and
mushrooms, in stock so they can
prepare and bake their selection
of baked items for sale each day.
He must also make sure that
all equipment, such as ovens,
dough-making machinery and
refrigerators, is in working order.
Figure 3.7 The owner and staff at a busy bakery need to effectively communicate with all its
stakeholders.
Chen now works on a part-time basis and is planning to fully retire from the business in the
next couple of years. To ensure that the business still runs productively, he must communicate
with his staff on matters such as their days and hours of work. Additionally, at the end of trade
each day, he needs to be advised of the bakery’s daily sales and stock levels so that stock can
be replenished. Chen is aware that he must ensure that his staff are trained and understand
health and safety requirements, as the business is regularly visited by the local council health
inspectors. With the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become important that he ensures that all staff
wear their face masks and that they actively control the number of customers permitted into the
shop at any one time.
Read the above two scenarios and recommend the form(s) of communication that you believe
would be most effective. Justify your choice.

Delegation
Delegation is the process where formal authority is passed down the hierarchy of a business.
It can occur at all levels and types and sizes of business. For example, a senior manager will
delegate to middle management, who will then delegate further down the chain of command
to front-line managers, who will then instruct the workers in their tasks. In a small business,
it may occur when the owner of a shoe shop authorises (delegates to) the floor staff to take
delivery of the newly arrived stock, check that all stock stated on the delivery note is exactly
what has been delivered, price the stock and then display it on the shelves ready for sale.
The authority to delegate needs to come right from the top of the business. If the business is a
company, then the shareholders, upon electing the board of directors, assign to them the right
or power to delegate to the chief executive officer and senior management the running of the
business. If the business is a sole trader or partnership, the authority will come from the owner
or partners.
Analysis: determine the tasks to be delegated
Appointment: nominate subordinate to
whom task is to be allocated
Briefing: define the task to be delegated
Control: monitor and encourage person

Appraisal: review and revise

responsibility
where the
position or job
requires a person
to perform a task
accountability the
extent to which

supervisors or
managers for

or performance
The acceptance of authority by a person indicates their acceptance of responsibility and
accountability. Responsibility remains with the manager or person to whom it is assigned, and
the only way that manager or person can be released from that responsibility is if a superior
takes it away.
If authority is retained by senior management or the business owner and not delegated, it is
said to be centralised, whereas authority passed down to the lower levels of the business is said
to be decentralised.
While delegation is a skill in itself, it is also a process that requires other skills to make it
effective, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the ability to analyse a job and have a clear understanding of what authority is required to
carry out the various parts of the job
the ability to establish performance standards
the ability to set realistic checkpoints and deadlines for tasks
the ability to select appropriate people to perform the delegated tasks
good communication skills
the ability to assess completed delegated tasks and provide feedback, in the form of praise
or further advice, to subordinates.

Benefits of delegation
Assists in the smooth flow of
production and work processes,
as work will continue even in
the absence of the owner or
manager
Acts as a time-saver, freeing
management to be involved in
longer-term planning and
more important tasks
Figure 3.9 Benefits of delegation
Not all tasks and actions to be undertaken by management are suitable for delegation.
Table 3.10 identifies some of those tasks that are suited to delegation and others where
delegation would be ill-advised.
Table 3.10 Examples of tasks suited to and not suited to delegation

training, personal development
and job satisfaction

Tasks that form part of a larger project Strategic planning
Repetitive or time-consuming tasks High-risk decisions
The collection or organisation of data High-cost decisions
Training and development of subordinates Confidential matters
Highly specialised areas requiring specific
training
Similarly, not all managers or business owners are good at delegating. There may be a variety of
reasons for this, including:
•
insecurity or fear that the subordinate to whom they have delegated a task may let
them down
•
feeling threatened that it might show up their inadequacies if the subordinate does too
good a job
•
being too disorganised or inflexible in how they organise their own work
•
being focused too heavily on the short-term achievement of work deadlines and therefore
thinking it is quicker to do the job themselves
•
a lack of trust and faith in their subordinates’ abilities
•
a desire for their own power and therefore being reluctant to relinquish authority as it might
make them feel less important
•
subordinates lacking confidence, training or experience or perhaps not wanting to accept
responsibility for any delegated tasks.

Planning
Planning is described as a decision-making process that is future-oriented. It involves
understanding the purpose or mission of a business and formulating the various levels of
objectives for the business. Factors drawn from various levels of the business environment can
cause uncertainty for a business. Undertaking planning assists a business to reduce these levels
of uncertainty. Steps in the planning process are outlined in Table 3.11.

ACTIVITY 3.6
The principal and school council of your school are looking at the strategic direction of the
school. As important stakeholders of the school, they would like you to apply your knowledge to
undertake a SWOT analysis of the school. The results of this analysis will assist school council to
formulate the strategic plans for the school. This activity can be undertaken as an individual or
class task.
Planning is generally ‘organised’ in a hierarchical structure,
with the overall direction coming from the top level of
a business. For a company, this is the board of directors
and senior management, while for a smaller business the
owner or business partners would represent this level.
Planning is categorised into three levels: strategic, tactical
and operational.
Strategic planning is the formal, long-term (two to
five years) planning process that establishes the overall
direction of the business. It is undertaken by the owner
of a small business or the senior management team of a
larger company. The planning decisions made at this level
will impact on the type of structure the business adopts,
and its values, business philosophies, strategic direction
and objectives.
Figure 3.12 Planning is essential for reducing uncertainty
in business.
Tactical planning is the formal, medium-term (one to two years) planning undertaken by
middle management to implement the strategic plan of the business. This level of planning
occurs within each department or functional area of a business and its aim is to bring the
objectives of the business into reality.
Operational planning is the lowest level of planning and relates to setting goals and creating
and implementing plans for small groups, teams or individual employees of a business. It
involves the planning of operations on a daily, monthly or up to one-year basis by front-line
managers or supervisors within the business. They will be making plans to achieve goals such
as increasing efficiency, reducing mistakes and reorganising or improving the work processes
of people within their work team. Planning at this level will relate to activities such as staffing
rosters, ordering of supplies and production output schedules.

Leading
Businesses, regardless of size, need managers to be able
to lead and control the business’s activities. A good leader
knows when to step in and when to step away and allow
talented people they have hired to achieve the business’s
future potential. Businesspeople, whether they are
entrepreneurs who founded a business or operators of
small and medium-sized businesses, need to understand
that if they cannot relinquish some control of their
business, its growth will be stunted and its full potential
never realised.

Leading involves influencing others towards attaining the objectives of the business. Effective
leading requires a manager to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
establish conditions that motivate, engage and inspire subordinates
be a good communicator
act as a role model who is creative, curious, humble, caring and trustworthy, and uses power
effectively
understand those whom they are going to lead: their personalities, values, attitudes and
emotions
be able to build teams
inspire loyalty, dedication and commitment in those they lead
resolve conflicts

(EI) the ability

Learning to lead takes time, and it can be assisted by understanding the theory of emotional
intelligence (EI). In 2002, Daniel Goleman, a psychologist, helped develop this theory. The
relationship between being effective in leading and emotional intelligence is very close. When
leading, a manager needs to ensure that tasks are completed successfully and the team of
subordinates under their control is kept together. In addition, they must ensure that each
individual in that team is happy and contributing on an individual basis to the successful
outcome of the team.
The EI theory incorporates a set of competencies that allows a manager to perceive, understand
and regulate emotions in themselves and in others. For a manager to be judged as having
excellent leadership skills, attending to the competencies outlined in Table 3.12 would be
essential.
Table 3.12 Five competencies linked to excellent leadership skills
Essential competencies Explanation
Emotional self-awareness Knowing what one is feeling at any given time and understanding
the impact those moods have on others
Self-regulation Controlling or redirecting one’s emotions, anticipating
consequences before acting on impulse
Motivation Utilising emotional factors to achieve goals, enjoying the learning
process and persevering in the face of obstacles
Empathy Sensing the emotions of others
Social skills Managing relationships, inspiring others and inducing desired
responses from them
Businesses function more effectively when they operate as a team. These teams may occur at
various levels; for instance, the senior management team establishes the strategic direction
for the business. Within any business there will be project teams and natural work groups. It
is important that team leadership skills are exhibited by the team leader, whether leading a
project team or a work group, to ensure the success of the team in achieving their objectives.

Teamwork is best understood as a set of behaviours that two or more people demonstrate
when working on some common task or pursuing a common objective. Employees are more
likely to share the vision and objectives of a business if they participate as a team, particularly in
the problem-solving and the decision-making processes. When people listen carefully to each
other, seek and take seriously each other’s opinions, and make use of each other’s competencies
and expertise, they are involved in teamwork. Teamwork encourages open communication,
improves morale, workplace cooperation and productivity, and develops a positive corporate
culture. Team leadership skills are therefore important for a manager to be able to guide and
direct this powerful business tool: teams.

1 Working in pairs, identify two people from your community – they could be involved in
business, music, sport, politics or your school – who you consider to be ‘good leaders’.
2 Referring to the list below, identify and analyse what you consider are the traits that you
value and admire the most in each leader:
•
that they are authentic, trustworthy, reliable and demonstrate integrity in their actions
•
that they treat people fairly and are empathetic in their treatment of others
•
that they are decisive and know their own mind, taking time before deciding on an issue
and then sticking to their convictions
•
that they are a strategic thinker and happy to be around for a long time and deal with
big issues
•
that they demonstrate a high level of transparency, meaning they share information
with their staff, are trustworthy and able to communicate, and are willing to be
accountable for their actions
•
that they are accessible, friendly and welcoming even though they are very busy people.

Decision-making
In the day-to-day operations of a business, a manager or business owner can be faced with
numerous problems they need to overcome and decisions they need to make resulting from
changes in the macro, operating and internal environments. Some of these decisions will in
fact be routine and not require much deliberation. In other cases, decision-making may be
more difficult or complex and require more time and thought to be put into the process before
arriving at the final decision. These are the sorts of decisions that involve the factors outlined in
Table 3.13.
Table 3.13 Factors to be considered in decision-making
decision-making
a multistep
approach
whereby a
selection is
made between a
range of different
alternatives
Problem or issue Explanation
High level of uncertainty Many of the facts surrounding the problem or issue are unknown
Complexity A number of interrelated factors need consideration
High-risk consequences Resulting from the outcome of the decision
Interpersonal Issues related to how people involved in the decision will react
Possible alternatives Choices to be reviewed are numerous
Using a systematic process when trying to reach a decision reduces the likelihood of overlooking
important factors that should be considered. Outlined in Table 3.14 is a six-step process for effective
decision-making. The decision-making skill requires managers to recognise problems and then
become resourceful in seeking help from others to think critically, creatively and reflectively, and
to adapt to alternative solutions. Managers who undertake this process understand that a quick
solution will not work to resolve a complex issue. They spend time analysing the problem from all
angles and are open and honest in communicating with those involved.
Table 3.14 Systematic approach to decision-making
Steps Explanation
1  Identify the problem and
define the objectives
Be sure to identify and define the actual problem or issue needing resolution
2  Gather the necessary
information to establish
the cause of the problem
Investigate the circumstances surrounding the issue and search for factors that may
have created the problem. Once all the information is gathered, reassess the problem
to see if it is the same.

3  Develop alternative
solutions
The existence of some choice is necessary for effective decision-making. Develop
creative and imaginative possible solutions to the problem. However, retaining the
status quo is always one alternative.
4 Analyse the alternatives Rank and sort the different alternatives. Each alternative must be evaluated in terms
of its strengths and weaknesses, benefits, costs, advantages and disadvantages in
achieving objectives of the team, department or business.
5  Choose an alternative and
implement it
Management needs to decide the best outcome, given the conditions under which the
decision has to be made. Management must communicate clearly the decision that has
been taken, the required results and personnel associated with its implementation.
6  Evaluate the
implementation
Provide feedback on progress, making the necessary adjustments. Evaluation enables
managers to learn from experience and improve their further decision-making and
problem-solving skills.
Step 1
Step 2
Identify the problem
Define the objective
Gather information
Develop alternatives
In some cases, the decision-making process may reflect
a strong team involvement at the discussion stage of the
risks and alternatives. The overall decision may be a team
effort, or it may require an individual to make a decision. This
depends largely on the complexity of the issue, the leader’s
management style and the structure of the business.

Scenario
Oaktree is a nursery operating in regional Victoria. The business has been run by horticulturalist
Andrew and his wife Jacqueline for 15 years. Over the years, they have built up the business and are
well known in the area for the quality of their plants and also for the advice they give to gardeners.
They now need to decide whether to keep the business as a nursery or broaden its operation to
include a cafe where people can come and enjoy meals throughout the day. Jacqueline is happy
to be responsible for running that side of the business. She believes that by opening the cafe they
will attract not only locals but also ‘day-trippers’ as their town is only 90 minutes from Melbourne.
Operating as both a garden centre and a cafe will provide Oaktree with dual income streams;
however, consideration needs to be given to the cost involved in setting up this new venture.
Task
The owners of Oaktree, Andrew and Jacqueline, have asked you to assist them to decide whether they
should undertake this new venture. Demonstrate your understanding of decision-making by including
the theoretical steps of the decision-making process as well as linking each step to the scenario.

Chapter 3 Management styles and skills
79
Interpersonal
Interpersonal skills are those skills used by a manager when dealing with people on a
personal basis, such as being able to lead, motivate, communicate, manage conflict and build
team rapport.
As mentioned in the section on leading, emotional intelligence forms an important component
of a manager’s tool set in applying interpersonal skills. It is recognised that there are some core
interpersonal skills, such as the ability to be:
interpersonal
skills those skills
used every day
to communicate
and interact with
other people,
both individually
and in groups
•
•
•
•
•
a team player and to work effectively with others, both in the internal and external
environments of the business
both empathic (understanding a situation from another’s point of view) and assertive (being
able to state your own requirements)
a good communicator
able to motivate and encourage others
ethical, honest and able to respect the values,
beliefs, aspirations and contributions of others.
For interpersonal relations to be maintained on
a positive level, managers need to be able to
manage conflict with stakeholders (both internal
and external). Often conflict can arise through
differences in the expectations, goals, needs and
wants of the manager and their subordinates.
A manager may want something to be done;
however, their subordinates want something else.
Should the manager adopt an aggressive, win-
at-any-cost approach? Alternatively, is it better
to adopt an assertive yet collaborative approach,
where both parties to the conflict can gain a
win? Adopting the second approach can turn the
potential area of conflict into one of agreement
between the parties.
Figure 3.17 Interpersonal skills require communication and understanding
on all levels.

The relationship between management
styles and management skills
Learning intentions – at the
end of this chapter section I
will be able to:
3.3.1 Identify and describe the relationship between
management styles and management skills
It is important that businesses have tools in place to be able to evaluate whether the
management style and skills adopted by a particular manager were appropriate when
managing a range of business situations.
Outlined in Table 3.15 are a range of situations where managers would need to determine
which management style, and related skills, was appropriate for the given situation. It is also
important to assess the effectiveness of a manager in their role in terms of managing both the
tasks to be completed and the staff for whom they are responsible.

Luigi Bocca is the owner and chief executive officer of an independent boutique supermarket
called Bocca located in one of Melbourne’s trendy inner suburbs. His shop is designed to cater
to the needs of the growing number of people living in inner-city apartments as well as people
still living in homes that they have owned for the last 20 or 30 years. To meet the changing
requirements of his customers, Luigi is now stocking a vast range of organic products alongside
the traditional offerings of fresh meat, fish, delicatessen products, bread, fruit and vegetables.
He also offers a wide range of ‘grab and go’ foods such as sandwiches, salads and sushi, and
ready-to-eat meals such as lasagne, ravioli, beef and lamb casseroles and curries with rice.
The trading hours of Bocca are 8 a.m. until 9 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and 10 a.m. until 7 p.m.
on Sunday.
Luigi opened Bocca in the early 1990s and since then the sales revenue of the business has been
steadily increasing. He also expanded the size of the store to now have a large retail footprint.
Luigi is now starting to think about reducing his working hours and ultimately entering his
retirement. He would like to spend more time travelling within Australia and back to Italy with
his wife Louisa. To make this transition happen, he knows that he needs to start sharing his
management role with other staff members, thus expanding the current management team,
which is made up of his daughter Annabel in the role of finance manager and accountant, his
eldest son Joseph in charge of the store’s IT systems, and his youngest son Alberto, who is the
operations manager.

The store employs 20 full-time staff who have worked at Bocca since its opening. These
employees have a very good understanding of how the business operates and act as
supervisors for the casual staff. Many of the full-time staff are advancing in age and are also
thinking of transitioning to retirement and will need to be replaced. The remaining members of
staff work on a casual basis. Some are students whose work rosters are arranged around their
study commitments at university or TAFE. Others are local people (male and female) who want
to work hours that fit around their family commitments.

There are several different types of business ownership and legal structures.
A public sector business is owned by government.
A private sector business is owned by individuals.
The most common legal structures for businesses are:
— sole trader
—
— partnership
—
— company.
—
There are two types of company:
— private limited
—
— public listed.
—
A company is a separate legal entity to its owners/shareholders, who enjoy
the benefits of limited liability.
Social enterprises exist to pursue social and/or environmental goals.
Government business enterprises are government-owned (public sector)
enterprises that have adopted a corporate model.

All businesses must establish aims or objectives.
Objectives should be set using the SMART principle.
Business objectives can be to make a profit, to increase market share, to
improve efficiency, to improve effectiveness, to fulfil a market need, to fulfil
a social need and to meet shareholder expectations.
Vision and mission statements are important for all businesses.
A values statement allows a business to focus on what is important in the
business related to its shared values and cultural priorities.
Stakeholders have expectations regarding the performance of a business.
It is important for businesses to continually revisit objectives and look at
ways to improve their other objectives.

Key knowledge Summary
•
Management
styles, including
autocratic, persuasive,
consultative,
participative and
laissez-faire
•
•
•
•
Management style is the approach used to provide direction, implement
plans and motivate people.
There are a variety of management styles: autocratic, persuasive,
consultative, participative and laissez-faire.
The contingency or situational management approach applies a range of
variables that can be used to determine the appropriate style for a given set
of circumstances.
The variables are the nature of the task, the time frame, the level of experience
of the employees, any constraints (such as money or resources), the corporate
culture of the business and finally the preferred style of the manager.
•
The appropriateness
of management
styles in relation to
the nature of the task,
time, experience
of employees and
manager preference
•
The styles vary according to a range of characteristics. First, their degree of
centralisation relating to authority and decision-making. Second, the focus
or orientation they adopt, whether task achievement is of greater importance
than having satisfied employees or a combination of both. Third, their
belief in what acts to motivate employees: is it money or challenging and
interesting tasks? Fourth, the attitude of the manager to their subordinates:
do they believe they need to be directed in everything they do or do they
actually have trust and faith in their ability? Finally, the communication flow
differs between the styles, varying from closed (downward) to a totally open
flow in the participative style.
•
Management
skills, including
communication,
delegation, planning,
leading, decision-
making and
interpersonal
•
•
Management skills are the abilities or expertise required by a manager to
achieve their work.
A range of skills is required by managers regardless of their level in the
management hierarchy: communication, delegation, planning, leading,
decision-making and interpersonal.
•
The relationship
between management
styles and management
skills
•
The interrelationship that exists between management styles and skills
provides an opportunity for assessing whether management is effective.
•
Corporate culture, both
official and real
•
•
•
•
•
Corporate culture is an internal factor that management seeks to influence
with a view to optimisation of business performance.
Corporate culture refers to the shared values and beliefs of people within a
business.
Official corporate culture refers to the set of values and beliefs desired by
the management of a business.
Real/unofficial culture refers to the culture that actually prevails in a business.
The following factors are keys to developing the desired corporate culture
within a business organisation:
— mission, vision and values statements
—
— management structure
—
— management style
—
— policies and procedures
—
— business documentation and forms of communication used
—
— the people within the business
—
— the physical environment and material symbols within the business
—
— stories, narratives and rituals shared within the business.

Sample examination questions and advice
Unit 3 Area of Study 1: Business foundations
In this Area of Study, students are introduced to the key characteristics of businesses and their
stakeholders. They investigate potential conflicts between the different demands of stakeholders on a
business. Corporate culture and a range of management styles and skills that may be used when managing
a business are also examined and applied to contemporary business case studies from the past four years.
Outcome 1 requires students to be able to analyse the key characteristics of businesses, their
stakeholders, management styles and skills, and their corporate culture.
Question 1
Mick and Richard are partners in Leaf Inventions. They have decided that, rather than continuing to
operate in their current legal structure of a partnership, they will incorporate their business and form
a company. They are, however, uncertain whether to incorporate to become a private limited or public
listed company.
Discuss the implications for the business, Leaf Inventions, if its owners decide to become a private
company rather than being publicly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. (4 marks)

A possible answer to Question 1 might be:
Sample response
By adopting the legal structure of a company, regardless of whether private limited or public
listed, Mick and Richard will gain certain advantages. One important implication related to
adopting either form of company structure is that it provides Mick and Richard (as shareholders)
the protection of creating a separate legal entity and therefore limiting their liability for any
debts incurred by the business. It also provides them with perpetuity (ongoing life) for their
business. Establishing the business as a public listed company will, however, provide greater
opportunity for Leaf Inventions to raise capital through having the ability to have a larger
number of shareholders in the business, as it will be listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.
While both forms of company structure must ensure that they adhere to legal and compliance
requirements, these are less onerous and less costly for a private limited company.
Marking guide:
•
No marks for a response that only defines the characteristics of a company
•
2–3 marks for a response that states and discusses arguments covering both forms of
company structure
•
To gain full marks (4 marks), you will need to state and discuss arguments covering implications for
adopting both forms of company structure and include reference to the stimulus material (i.e. Mick
and Richard and Leaf Inventions).
Question 2
Mick and Richard, owners of Leaf Inventions, have decided to become a private limited company.

Identify relevant stakeholders to the business.
Choose two stakeholders and describe their interest. (Remember, there are many stakeholders for
a business – owners, managers, employees, customers, suppliers and the general community.)
Determine any potential areas of conflict.
A possible answer to Question 2 might be:
Sample response
Two stakeholders, being either an individual or a group, who have a vested interest in the
activities of Leaf Inventions are firstly its shareholders, who would be looking for the business to
be profitable and to provide dividends to them based on their shareholding. An area of conflict
could arise when Mick and Richard, who are now shareholders, want to retain funds within the
business to assist with its future growth, whereas the other shareholders (owners) would like to
receive a large dividend yield on their investment.
A second stakeholder to the business is the government, which wants to ensure that
the company is correctly registered, is paying the correct forms of taxation, is making
superannuation contributions on behalf of its staff and is compliant with any specific regulations
relating to operating a company. Conflict may arise between the company and the government
if any of the above requirements are not adequately met or are breached.
Marking guide:
•
1 mark for identifying two relevant stakeholders
•
2 marks for description of two relevant stakeholders and nature of interest
•
3–4 marks for description of two relevant stakeholders, nature of interest and possible areas of
conflict.
Question 3
Mick is chief finance officer and Richard is operations manager of Leaf Inventions Pty Ltd. It is the
aim of the business to enter a period of growth, and to achieve this they have each agreed the most
appropriate management style for them to adopt is consultative.

This question has multiple parts (management styles and skills) and requires all parts to be
completed to gain full marks.
There are a range of other skills that could be identified and justified, including delegation,
leadership, decision-making and interpersonal.
A possible answer to Question 3a might be:
Sample response
The consultative management style is characterised by the manager exercising centralised
control and authority while taking account of the ideas and concepts provided by employees,
particularly in relation to making decisions. The manager considers task achievement to be an
important factor, but also understands the importance of the ‘people factor’, which results in
employees becoming more motivated and wanting to perform to their best.
Two management skills that would be important are communication and planning.
Communication that is open and encourages discussion and feedback would be essential.
It would be in the form of top-down information and directions by management (Mick
and Richard) to employees (subordinates) related to their growth plans. Upward flow of
communication from the employees to management would then be able to provide valuable
options and feedback relating to expansion plans.
Planning is a skill that relates to future-oriented decision-making. It involves understanding
the purpose or aims of the business, then formulating various levels of objectives, plans and
strategies to meet the desired outcome. This skill is therefore important if Mick and Richard wish
to embark on a growth strategy for their business.
Marking guide:
•
2 marks for describing the key characteristics of the consultative style
•
3 marks for identifying and justifying two management skills that relate to growing the business.

A possible answer to Question 3b might be:
Sample response
Corporate culture relates to the shared values and beliefs held within a business. By adopting
a consultative management style, Mick and Richard are demonstrating that they want to set
the approach the business will be taking, as they wish to remain in control of its operations,
its communication flow and therefore its official culture. However, by adopting this style they
demonstrate that they value their employees and wish them to be motivated and contribute to
the success of the business.

To gain full marks, students need to establish the impact of characteristics of the style on the
corporate culture of the business.

TARGET: Demonstrate comprehension of concepts.
TEST: Can student explain ideas in their own words or recognise examples?

AVOID: Direct recall of definitions. Require paraphrasing or recognition in new contexts.

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can identify and name the five management styles on the continuum from task-oriented to people-oriented
CODE: 3.1.1

WHAT (concept explanation):
The five management styles are autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire. They sit on a continuum from task-oriented (autocratic) to people-oriented (laissez-faire).

WHY (importance):
Recognising where each style sits on the continuum helps you quickly compare them and understand their underlying philosophy.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
If asked to arrange styles from most to least centralised, the order would be: autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative, laissez-faire.

SUBTOPIC: Management Styles
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the five management styles — autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire — and their key characteristics. It examines how each style differs in terms of control, communication, decision-making and employee orientation.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the distinct features of each management style is essential for analysing how businesses are run. Being able to identify and describe these styles is a foundational skill tested in SACs and exams.

TOPIC: Management styles and skills
SUBJECT: Business Management | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3

CHAPTER OVERVIEW
Managing a business of any size can be a complex and challenging
task for the business’s owners and managers. The majority of
businesses will establish as one of their main objectives ‘growing the
value of the business’. The leaders or senior managers of that business
must set a clear vision and be able to continually communicate the
vision. Their role is to then get out of the way and let the second-line
managers do their job. The choice of management style and skills
adopted by these managers will differ. Ideally, the style and skills
adopted should be appropriate to the situation within the business.

people
A management style, broadly speaking, is the manner and approach of providing direction,
implementing plans and motivating people that is adopted by a manager. There are distinctly
different styles of management: autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire.
Management styles can have specific features. For example, the way managers interact with
employees will depend on how they exercise authority, the degree of task or employee
orientation, and the manner of communication (‘top-down’, ‘bottom-up’ or lateral). The type of
management structure adopted by the business in order to achieve its goals and objectives,
such as bureaucratic (multilayered), a flatter structure or a team-based structure, will also
impact on the style chosen.
Most managers use a range of styles based on the situation that is required to be managed, their
own (manager’s) personality, the characteristics of their subordinates and any time constraints.
For instance, if a manager wanted to introduce 12-hour shifts to raise productivity by increasing
the utilisation of expensive plant and equipment, it is unlikely that an autocratic task-oriented
style would be effective in managing this situation. A participative or consultative management
style, where employee input was sought and considered before making a decision, would be
more appropriate.
Management styles can be demonstrated using a continuum of management approaches
based on their orientation towards the task or employees/people. At one end of the continuum,
the importance of the task outweighs that of the employees/people. The other end places
greater importance on the people, while not forgetting the importance of task achievement.

Types of management style
Management style refers to the different ways in which managers behave. The preferred style
of a manager will depend on many factors, such as cultural styles of leadership and the type
of business.
Autocratic management style
Autocratic management style (authoritarian) is often referred to as the classical
management style.
The characteristics of the autocratic management style are outlined in Table 3.1.

is centralised,
there is little

authority and

is one-way –
downwards
Managers want to be in control and retain authority, particularly
when undertaking planning, coordinating and monitoring various
human and physical activities of the business. They want to be the
main person guiding employees towards achieving the objectives
of the business.
Task-oriented Great importance is placed on achieving the task and following
established process. Policies and procedures are maintained in
detail and enforced by frequent checks.
Motivating factor Main motivator for work performance is payment (i.e. money)
Decision-making Centralised and controlled by the manager with decision or
orders then passed on or told to subordinates
Employees’ contribution Little value is placed on the importance of the employees’
contribution to the overall performance of the business. The
objectives, aims and operating environments reflect the ideas,
beliefs and values of the manager.
Communication Centralised with a strict top-down or hierarchical chain-of-
command approach to management
centralised

in a hierarchy;

and worker
participation in
decision-making
is non-existent
An autocratic manager has a high regard for production and efficiency (task-oriented).
Managers expect team members to comply with their decisions and they are not concerned
with the attitude or thinking of the group. This can result in passive resistance from team
members, which requires the manager to then apply continual pressure and direction in
order to get things done. If this style is adopted by the CEO of a business, it can result in high-
potential employees and even members of the senior management team walking out the door
because their ideas and views are not being heard. Managers adopting this style often use
punishment and rewards to achieve their objectives.

58 Unit 3 | Managing a business
Table 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages of an autocratic management style
Advantages Disadvantages
Decision-making is quick, as only one person
needs to be involved
A quick decision is not always the best
decision
Decisions are made by an experienced leader Discourages teamwork; employees’ opinions
and input are not sought
Communication is direct Does not allow for open communication and
feedback on ideas
Roles and expectations of employees are
defined and monitored
Low motivation and job satisfaction, as
workers are not empowered; staff turnover
may increase when staff feel undervalued
High regard for production and efficiency Too task-focused, with insufficient regard for
employees as people with needs; does not
take account of needs of generations X and Y
and baby boomer employees
Suits high-risk or difficult decisions (e.g.
closure of business operations, retrenchment
of staff)
Creates feelings of unease and being ‘kept
in the dark’; can create a ‘them’ versus
‘us’ attitude
One industry that focuses on results and efficiency as being paramount is hospitality – in
particular, restaurants. Diners expect to receive timely, orderly service and quality food, while
restaurants are generally being run on slim margins, relying heavily on positive reviews and
return customers. Their business will suffer even from small mistakes. In the kitchen, it can be
the head chef adopting all the characteristics of an autocratic manager, ordering and ruling over
the kitchen staff with an iron hand. One extreme example is renowned chef Gordon Ramsay.
The maître d’hôtel responsible for the waiting staff will often also adopt this style.
ACTIVITY 3.1
Describe how you might feel if you were an employee under the management of an
autocratic manager. Explain how these feelings may disrupt or even aid your ability to be a
productive employee.

Persuasive management style
A persuasive management style is that of a manager who uses their ability to interpret
a situation, people’s actions and dialogue, and then strongly urges or convinces them to
do a task or achieve objectives the manager’s way. This style has many characteristics in
common with the autocratic style. The main difference between the styles, however, is
that once a persuasive manager makes a decision, they then try to convince a subordinate
that what was decided by the manager is in the subordinate’s best interests. For example,
a marketing department manager who has an idea for increasing sales targets will try to
convince the rest of the marketing team that only their idea will improve the sales targets.

This type of manager will try to bring people around to their own view, while sticking to
their decision with or without agreement. Under this type of management style, employees
will have a better idea of what to do when there is a change externally or internally,
because the manager has explained their intentions.
The characteristics of the persuasive management style are outlined in Table 3.3.
Table 3.3 The characteristics of the persuasive management style
Characteristic Description
Control and authority Centralised
Task-oriented Great importance on achieving the task and following the established
process. The manager ensures that policies and procedures are

Motivating factor Believes that payment (money) for tasks performed is the main
motivator for work performance
Decision-making Centralised or controlled by management, with the decision or order
then explained or presented to subordinates
Employees’ contribution Some value placed on contribution of employees to overall
performance of the business. The objectives, aims and operating
environments still, however, reflect the ideas, beliefs and values of
the manager.
Communication Centralised, with a strict top-down or hierarchical chain-of-command
approach to management
Table 3.4 Advantages and disadvantages of a persuasive management style
Advantages Disadvantages
Decision-making is quick and still made by
one person
No input from workers into decision-making
process; undervalues benefits of teamwork
Suits high-risk decisions (e.g. closure of
factory, redundancies)
Workers can still feel alienated, as their
opinions are not sought
Employees have a clear idea about what they
have to do and achieve
Opportunities for employee initiative and
commitment overlooked, leading to low levels
of motivation and job satisfaction

into account. For example, a school principal
may ask the student leadership group, parents
and staff for their suggestions on a new uniform,
then consider all the arguments and make a
decision on the type of uniform that will be
introduced. Another example is when a team
leader of a project holds weekly meetings with
the team members where they are given the
opportunity to share progress of their job tasks
and responsibilities. The meetings allow team
members the opportunity to provide feedback
on areas needing improvement. The team leader
can then use this feedback to review and set
schedules, allocate resources and prioritise tasks
and goals for the coming week.
The characteristics of the consultative
management style are outlined in Table 3.5.

their staff.

Control and authority Centralised and exercised by the manager. More employee-based
and less centralised than autocratic and persuasive styles. Ideas and
concepts provided by employees.
Task achievement Important driving factor, balancing with understanding of ‘people

Advantages Disadvantages
Gain a variety of ideas from the suggestions
of employees, which will lead to a better
decision-making outcome
Employees may not understand the
complexity of the problem being discussed
Reasonable level of employee involvement Time-consuming if many stakeholders are
consulted
Acts to motivate and increase an employee’s
level of job satisfaction
Employees may still not feel valued if they
have provided their ideas but these are
overlooked
Participative management style
The participative management style has become very popular because it focuses on the
interaction between management and employees. This style keeps employees informed about
issues that affect their work, with management and employees sharing in decision-making
and problem-solving tasks. The manager is now acting more as a coach who gets their team of
employees to work together to improve the overall performance of the business. The manager
does not delegate away responsibility, as they still are entitled to have the final say.
The characteristics of the participative management style are outlined in Table 3.7.

Characteristic Description
Control and authority Decentralised approach. Corporate objectives, while determined
by senior management, are followed by setting departmental,

Advantages Disadvantages
Manager demonstrates trust and faith in the

who question the ability of their co-workers
Employee morale is increased, as employees
feel part of the process of the business;
this leads to an increase in motivation and

than job satisfaction
Employees feel a sense of ownership and
empowerment as they are now decision-

Lack of contribution by all employees, as some
would rather not be involved in decision-
making, preferring to be told what to do
Decision-making, particularly at middle to
lower levels of the business, is improved
because employees are involved in making

Laissez-faire management style
The laissez-faire management style can also be
called ‘free-rein’ or ‘hands-off’ style. It is a style in which
management provides little direction to employees.
Management’s involvement and responsibility often
relate to outlining budgetary constraints, coordinating
timelines and ensuring that broad corporate objectives
are achieved. Employees are then empowered to
determine their own objectives, solve their own
problems and make their own decisions.

This style is commonly found in workplaces where the employees are highly educated, skilled
and experienced. This group of employees require little direction and have their own motivation
(drive) to accomplish, and take pride in their accomplishments. It is also found in businesses
that are in the ‘start-up’ phase or incubator phase of product development. Examples of
businesses where the laissez-faire management style could work well are advertising agencies,
product design firms, start-up social media businesses, and specialised engineering, medical
research or architectural businesses. For instance, a manager of a website development
company could entrust the website designers to work independently with little interference
from the manager when fulfilling the customer’s needs. Group members would be allowed to
perform as they like, so far as this does not violate the objectives and policies of the business,
and tasks are completed within budgets and agreed timelines. This style also suits the dynamic
nature of an advertising company where creative freedom is very important.
Table 3.9 Advantages and disadvantages of the laissez-faire management style
Advantages Disadvantages
High employee independence, as employees
can set their own tasks with little involvement
from management
Lack of guidance can cause some employees
to have a sense of loss of direction
Strong motivation, empowerment and job
satisfaction for employees

freedom of this style

particularly well.
2 Explain how a laissez-faire style might suit employees who work well in both team and
autonomous work situations.
Contingency or situational management approach
Business environments (external and internal) are constantly changing, including innovations in
product development and fast delivery of goods. Businesses need to respond to these changes
in order to compete against other businesses, and this can then impact on the management
style adopted by the manager. In a contingency (situational) management approach,
managers must take into account all aspects of the current external and internal circumstances
and act on those aspects that are important to the situation that has arisen. The manager
demonstrates flexibility in these circumstances, which is a response known as ‘contingency
approach’. It benefits the business because it provides the potential for managers to learn

This approach works by applying a range of variables to assist in selecting the most appropriate
management style for managing a given situation. The following are considered:
•
•
•
•
•
the manager’s personality, characteristics or qualities, their values and skills, and how they
communicate with staff
their subordinates’ (employees’) characteristics, such as their level of knowledge, skills,
experience and values
the tasks that need to be completed by the team or business – are they complex, simple or
repetitive?
the constraints, such as time, money and resource availability
the corporate culture of the business and the relationships between management and staff.
As a result of various forces or situations, managers may not use any one particular
management style. Rather, a manager could use a variety of management styles as outlined in
the following situations:
•
•
An authoritarian style would be appropriate where there are a number of new and unskilled
employees who need to learn a job. The manager would need to keep tight control of the
situation and teach the new employees what their job entails in as short a time as possible in
order for them to become productive.
The participative management style would best suit the project manager of a group
of experienced, motivated employees working as a project team who are capable of
accomplishing the project objectives within the established time frame.

of JB Hi-Fi, took over as CEO of Premier Retail
from Mark McInnes, who had held the CEO
position for the previous 10 years.
$2.17. Under Murray’s leadership, a 25-fold
increase in the share price occurred, with a
share’s value now being in excess of $47.
Premier Retail owns a suite of retail brands and
chain stores that includes Just Jeans, Dotti,
Smiggle, Peter Alexander, Portmans, Jacqui E
and Jay Jays. Premier Retail trades from more
than 1200 stores located in seven countries. It
also has a wholesale and online presence.
Murray believes it is important to meet
regularly with his teams, undertake corridor
conversations, meet for coffee and make
connections while also getting out and visiting
the JB Hi-Fi and Good Guys stores.
When appointing Murray to the position of
CEO, Chairman of the Premier Retail board,
Solomon Lew, described him as ‘one of the
best retailers in Australia’, having delivered
significant growth, transformation and
shareholder value during his career at JB Hi-Fi
Group.

Stores were converted into dark stores to fulfil
online orders, and an internal delivery system
was launched where store staff delivered online
orders to customers’ homes in a fleet of 75 hire
cars and 25 vans. This initiative enabled JB Hi-

For each of the following scenarios, propose an appropriate management style, describe its
characteristics and provide two reasons to justify your suggestion.
1 Ian is an experienced business analyst at a major bank. He has been appointed as project
manager of a team of four employees who have the task of developing and implementing
a new risk management policy. His team members have been drawn from a variety of
functional areas within the bank (e.g. retail banking, information technology, legal and
finance). All members of his team are highly skilled and knowledgeable and capable of
working unsupervised. Ian does, however, feel that final decisions must be checked by him
before they present the new risk management policy to senior management for approval
prior to implementation.
2 Safiya decided that she wanted to start up and run a social media company. At university
she had studied a double degree – Business Studies (majoring in Marketing) and Computer
Science. While working in casual jobs during her five years of study, she found that she did
not have sufficient start-up capital to fund the business. Safiya was aware of the growing
popularity of crowdfunding as a way to raise capital. She discussed her business idea with
a group of her fellow university students, who were excited by her idea and keen to join her
in this entrepreneurial venture.

Skills are the ability to do something well, gained through training and experience, in order to
achieve the required goal. A close relationship exists between management styles and skills,
with certain management styles placing greater emphasis on different skills.
In addition, effective management requires a manager of any business to be capable of
producing an outcome that meets or exceeds accepted ethical standards. In achieving the
outcome, the manager should not undertake activities that are against their deeply held
moral values.

Communication skills
A renowned management consultant and author, Peter Drucker, said: ‘Management is doing
things right; leadership is doing the right things.’ He believed that the most important thing
in communication is to hear what isn’t being said: ‘Unless commitment is made, there are only
promises and hopes; but no plans.’
Communication skills are essential, as managers must be able to clarify with employees
the tasks required to be undertaken and completed. The main forms of communication that
managers will be involved in are:
•
•
•
personal communication – which involves sharing information and understanding between
the manager and a subordinate or a small group or work team. It is estimated that managers
spend between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of their work time in conversation. Therefore, it is
extremely important that they are effective in their interpersonal communication.
internal organisational communication – where systems are used to inform and share
information with employees (internal stakeholders) of the business. For instance, an
organisational chart can be used by management to inform employees about how the
business is structured, its functional areas, chain of command and communication channels.
Policy and procedure manuals are also used to inform employees about the way that the
business conducts itself.
external operational communication – which occurs when managers need to communicate
with stakeholders external to the business. It involves transmitting information to customers,
suppliers, investors, shareholders (if a company) and the community.

Figure 3.6 Main forms of communication used by managers
To achieve the vision of the business, open communication is vital if a manager wishes to
gain employee involvement in the expression and development of ideas. Frustration, lack
of motivation, inadequate direction and poor feedback between management and its
subordinates can result from weak or restricted communication flow.
A manager will be required to use a variety of forms of communication, such as:
•
reading – managers need to be able to locate, understand and interpret written data and
information, such as letters, reports, emails, documents, policies, procedures, codes of
practice, contracts and graphs

•
•
writing – to express thoughts and ideas, information and messages through emails, word-
processing documents, manuals and reports
speaking – to communicate orally by talking to people individually or in groups (small
or large) to disseminate information and gain feedback. Listening to oral messages is an
essential form of communication as a manager receives, attends to, interprets and responds
to oral messages. If managers do not develop the skill of listening, they may not hear the
suggestions or information from the most valuable employees.
ACTIVITY 3.5
Scenario 1
Aussie Home Delivery is a food home delivery business that has supplied fresh dairy, meat,
bread, vegetables and fruit to homes on a weekly basis for the past 10 years. Its general manager
needs to advise its staff that, due to increased competition from the online ordering and delivery
facility now provided by the major food retailers, Aussie Home Delivery will need to close down
its business. This closure will result in all its valued staff being made redundant.
Scenario 2
Chen owns and operates a
bakery in a busy strip shopping
centre in suburban Melbourne.
The bakery operates seven
days a week, with baking staff
starting work at 4 a.m. each day.
The business employs three
qualified and very experienced
bakers, three apprentice bakers
and eight shop assistants. To
ensure that the business runs
smoothly, Chen needs to plan
to have sufficient basic supplies
(flour and yeast) and any special
ingredients, such as dried fruit,
nuts, salami, pineapple and
mushrooms, in stock so they can
prepare and bake their selection
of baked items for sale each day.
He must also make sure that
all equipment, such as ovens,
dough-making machinery and
refrigerators, is in working order.
Figure 3.7 The owner and staff at a busy bakery need to effectively communicate with all its
stakeholders.
Chen now works on a part-time basis and is planning to fully retire from the business in the
next couple of years. To ensure that the business still runs productively, he must communicate
with his staff on matters such as their days and hours of work. Additionally, at the end of trade
each day, he needs to be advised of the bakery’s daily sales and stock levels so that stock can
be replenished. Chen is aware that he must ensure that his staff are trained and understand
health and safety requirements, as the business is regularly visited by the local council health
inspectors. With the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become important that he ensures that all staff
wear their face masks and that they actively control the number of customers permitted into the
shop at any one time.
Read the above two scenarios and recommend the form(s) of communication that you believe
would be most effective. Justify your choice.

Delegation
Delegation is the process where formal authority is passed down the hierarchy of a business.
It can occur at all levels and types and sizes of business. For example, a senior manager will
delegate to middle management, who will then delegate further down the chain of command
to front-line managers, who will then instruct the workers in their tasks. In a small business,
it may occur when the owner of a shoe shop authorises (delegates to) the floor staff to take
delivery of the newly arrived stock, check that all stock stated on the delivery note is exactly
what has been delivered, price the stock and then display it on the shelves ready for sale.
The authority to delegate needs to come right from the top of the business. If the business is a
company, then the shareholders, upon electing the board of directors, assign to them the right
or power to delegate to the chief executive officer and senior management the running of the
business. If the business is a sole trader or partnership, the authority will come from the owner
or partners.
Analysis: determine the tasks to be delegated
Appointment: nominate subordinate to
whom task is to be allocated
Briefing: define the task to be delegated
Control: monitor and encourage person
undertaking task
Appraisal: review and revise

responsibility
where the
position or job
requires a person
to perform a task
accountability the
extent to which
a worker is held
answerable to
supervisors or
managers for

or performance
The acceptance of authority by a person indicates their acceptance of responsibility and
accountability. Responsibility remains with the manager or person to whom it is assigned, and
the only way that manager or person can be released from that responsibility is if a superior
takes it away.
If authority is retained by senior management or the business owner and not delegated, it is
said to be centralised, whereas authority passed down to the lower levels of the business is said
to be decentralised.
While delegation is a skill in itself, it is also a process that requires other skills to make it
effective, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the ability to analyse a job and have a clear understanding of what authority is required to
carry out the various parts of the job
the ability to establish performance standards
the ability to set realistic checkpoints and deadlines for tasks
the ability to select appropriate people to perform the delegated tasks
good communication skills
the ability to assess completed delegated tasks and provide feedback, in the form of praise
or further advice, to subordinates.

Benefits of delegation
Assists in the smooth flow of
production and work processes,
as work will continue even in
the absence of the owner or
manager
Acts as a time-saver, freeing
management to be involved in
longer-term planning and
more important tasks
Figure 3.9 Benefits of delegation
Not all tasks and actions to be undertaken by management are suitable for delegation.
Table 3.10 identifies some of those tasks that are suited to delegation and others where
delegation would be ill-advised.
Table 3.10 Examples of tasks suited to and not suited to delegation
Provides an opportunity for skill
training, personal development
and job satisfaction

Shows trust and faith in
employees’ abilities
Tasks suited to delegation Tasks not suited to delegation
Tasks that form part of a larger project Strategic planning
Repetitive or time-consuming tasks High-risk decisions
The collection or organisation of data High-cost decisions
Training and development of subordinates Confidential matters
Highly specialised areas requiring specific
training
Similarly, not all managers or business owners are good at delegating. There may be a variety of
reasons for this, including:
•
insecurity or fear that the subordinate to whom they have delegated a task may let
them down
•
feeling threatened that it might show up their inadequacies if the subordinate does too
good a job
•
being too disorganised or inflexible in how they organise their own work
•
being focused too heavily on the short-term achievement of work deadlines and therefore
thinking it is quicker to do the job themselves
•
a lack of trust and faith in their subordinates’ abilities
•
a desire for their own power and therefore being reluctant to relinquish authority as it might
make them feel less important
•
subordinates lacking confidence, training or experience or perhaps not wanting to accept
responsibility for any delegated tasks.

Planning
Planning is described as a decision-making process that is future-oriented. It involves
understanding the purpose or mission of a business and formulating the various levels of
objectives for the business. Factors drawn from various levels of the business environment can
cause uncertainty for a business. Undertaking planning assists a business to reduce these levels
of uncertainty. Steps in the planning process are outlined in Table 3.11.

ACTIVITY 3.6
The principal and school council of your school are looking at the strategic direction of the
school. As important stakeholders of the school, they would like you to apply your knowledge to
undertake a SWOT analysis of the school. The results of this analysis will assist school council to
formulate the strategic plans for the school. This activity can be undertaken as an individual or
class task.
Planning is generally ‘organised’ in a hierarchical structure,
with the overall direction coming from the top level of
a business. For a company, this is the board of directors
and senior management, while for a smaller business the
owner or business partners would represent this level.
Planning is categorised into three levels: strategic, tactical
and operational.
Strategic planning is the formal, long-term (two to
five years) planning process that establishes the overall
direction of the business. It is undertaken by the owner
of a small business or the senior management team of a
larger company. The planning decisions made at this level
will impact on the type of structure the business adopts,
and its values, business philosophies, strategic direction
and objectives.
Figure 3.12 Planning is essential for reducing uncertainty
in business.
Tactical planning is the formal, medium-term (one to two years) planning undertaken by
middle management to implement the strategic plan of the business. This level of planning
occurs within each department or functional area of a business and its aim is to bring the
objectives of the business into reality.
Operational planning is the lowest level of planning and relates to setting goals and creating
and implementing plans for small groups, teams or individual employees of a business. It
involves the planning of operations on a daily, monthly or up to one-year basis by front-line
managers or supervisors within the business. They will be making plans to achieve goals such
as increasing efficiency, reducing mistakes and reorganising or improving the work processes
of people within their work team. Planning at this level will relate to activities such as staffing
rosters, ordering of supplies and production output schedules.

Leading
Businesses, regardless of size, need managers to be able
to lead and control the business’s activities. A good leader
knows when to step in and when to step away and allow
talented people they have hired to achieve the business’s
future potential. Businesspeople, whether they are
entrepreneurs who founded a business or operators of
small and medium-sized businesses, need to understand
that if they cannot relinquish some control of their
business, its growth will be stunted and its full potential
never realised.

Leading involves influencing others towards attaining the objectives of the business. Effective
leading requires a manager to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
establish conditions that motivate, engage and inspire subordinates
be a good communicator
act as a role model who is creative, curious, humble, caring and trustworthy, and uses power
effectively
understand those whom they are going to lead: their personalities, values, attitudes and
emotions
be able to build teams
inspire loyalty, dedication and commitment in those they lead
resolve conflicts
act as a mentor
be able to respond quickly and appropriately to change and help others to do the same.

emotional
intelligence
(EI) the ability
to perceive,
understand,

regulate
emotions in
ourselves and
others
Learning to lead takes time, and it can be assisted by understanding the theory of emotional
intelligence (EI). In 2002, Daniel Goleman, a psychologist, helped develop this theory. The
relationship between being effective in leading and emotional intelligence is very close. When
leading, a manager needs to ensure that tasks are completed successfully and the team of
subordinates under their control is kept together. In addition, they must ensure that each
individual in that team is happy and contributing on an individual basis to the successful
outcome of the team.
The EI theory incorporates a set of competencies that allows a manager to perceive, understand
and regulate emotions in themselves and in others. For a manager to be judged as having
excellent leadership skills, attending to the competencies outlined in Table 3.12 would be
essential.
Table 3.12 Five competencies linked to excellent leadership skills
Essential competencies Explanation
Emotional self-awareness Knowing what one is feeling at any given time and understanding
the impact those moods have on others
Self-regulation Controlling or redirecting one’s emotions, anticipating
consequences before acting on impulse
Motivation Utilising emotional factors to achieve goals, enjoying the learning
process and persevering in the face of obstacles
Empathy Sensing the emotions of others
Social skills Managing relationships, inspiring others and inducing desired
responses from them
Businesses function more effectively when they operate as a team. These teams may occur at
various levels; for instance, the senior management team establishes the strategic direction
for the business. Within any business there will be project teams and natural work groups. It
is important that team leadership skills are exhibited by the team leader, whether leading a
project team or a work group, to ensure the success of the team in achieving their objectives.

Teamwork is best understood as a set of behaviours that two or more people demonstrate
when working on some common task or pursuing a common objective. Employees are more
likely to share the vision and objectives of a business if they participate as a team, particularly in
the problem-solving and the decision-making processes. When people listen carefully to each
other, seek and take seriously each other’s opinions, and make use of each other’s competencies
and expertise, they are involved in teamwork. Teamwork encourages open communication,
improves morale, workplace cooperation and productivity, and develops a positive corporate
culture. Team leadership skills are therefore important for a manager to be able to guide and
direct this powerful business tool: teams.
ACTIVITY 3.8
Think of a leader you hold in high regard.
1 Working in pairs, identify two people from your community – they could be involved in
business, music, sport, politics or your school – who you consider to be ‘good leaders’.
2 Referring to the list below, identify and analyse what you consider are the traits that you
value and admire the most in each leader:
•
that they are authentic, trustworthy, reliable and demonstrate integrity in their actions
•
that they treat people fairly and are empathetic in their treatment of others
•
that they are decisive and know their own mind, taking time before deciding on an issue
and then sticking to their convictions
•
that they are a strategic thinker and happy to be around for a long time and deal with
big issues
•
that they demonstrate a high level of transparency, meaning they share information
with their staff, are trustworthy and able to communicate, and are willing to be
accountable for their actions
•
that they are accessible, friendly and welcoming even though they are very busy people.

Decision-making
In the day-to-day operations of a business, a manager or business owner can be faced with
numerous problems they need to overcome and decisions they need to make resulting from
changes in the macro, operating and internal environments. Some of these decisions will in
fact be routine and not require much deliberation. In other cases, decision-making may be
more difficult or complex and require more time and thought to be put into the process before
arriving at the final decision. These are the sorts of decisions that involve the factors outlined in
Table 3.13.
Table 3.13 Factors to be considered in decision-making

approach

Problem or issue Explanation
High level of uncertainty Many of the facts surrounding the problem or issue are unknown
Complexity A number of interrelated factors need consideration
High-risk consequences Resulting from the outcome of the decision
Interpersonal Issues related to how people involved in the decision will react
Possible alternatives Choices to be reviewed are numerous
Using a systematic process when trying to reach a decision reduces the likelihood of overlooking
important factors that should be considered. Outlined in Table 3.14 is a six-step process for effective
decision-making. The decision-making skill requires managers to recognise problems and then
become resourceful in seeking help from others to think critically, creatively and reflectively, and
to adapt to alternative solutions. Managers who undertake this process understand that a quick
solution will not work to resolve a complex issue. They spend time analysing the problem from all
angles and are open and honest in communicating with those involved.
Table 3.14 Systematic approach to decision-making
Steps Explanation
1  Identify the problem and
define the objectives
Be sure to identify and define the actual problem or issue needing resolution
2  Gather the necessary
information to establish
the cause of the problem
Investigate the circumstances surrounding the issue and search for factors that may
have created the problem. Once all the information is gathered, reassess the problem
to see if it is the same.

3  Develop alternative
solutions
The existence of some choice is necessary for effective decision-making. Develop
creative and imaginative possible solutions to the problem. However, retaining the
status quo is always one alternative.
4 Analyse the alternatives Rank and sort the different alternatives. Each alternative must be evaluated in terms
of its strengths and weaknesses, benefits, costs, advantages and disadvantages in
achieving objectives of the team, department or business.
5  Choose an alternative and
implement it
Management needs to decide the best outcome, given the conditions under which the
decision has to be made. Management must communicate clearly the decision that has
been taken, the required results and personnel associated with its implementation.
6  Evaluate the
implementation
Provide feedback on progress, making the necessary adjustments. Evaluation enables
managers to learn from experience and improve their further decision-making and
problem-solving skills.
Step 1
Step 2
Identify the problem
Define the objective
Gather information
Develop alternatives
In some cases, the decision-making process may reflect
a strong team involvement at the discussion stage of the
risks and alternatives. The overall decision may be a team
effort, or it may require an individual to make a decision. This
depends largely on the complexity of the issue, the leader’s
management style and the structure of the business.

Scenario
Oaktree is a nursery operating in regional Victoria. The business has been run by horticulturalist
Andrew and his wife Jacqueline for 15 years. Over the years, they have built up the business and are
well known in the area for the quality of their plants and also for the advice they give to gardeners.
They now need to decide whether to keep the business as a nursery or broaden its operation to
include a cafe where people can come and enjoy meals throughout the day. Jacqueline is happy
to be responsible for running that side of the business. She believes that by opening the cafe they
will attract not only locals but also ‘day-trippers’ as their town is only 90 minutes from Melbourne.
Operating as both a garden centre and a cafe will provide Oaktree with dual income streams;
however, consideration needs to be given to the cost involved in setting up this new venture.
Task
The owners of Oaktree, Andrew and Jacqueline, have asked you to assist them to decide whether they
should undertake this new venture. Demonstrate your understanding of decision-making by including
the theoretical steps of the decision-making process as well as linking each step to the scenario.

Interpersonal
Interpersonal skills are those skills used by a manager when dealing with people on a
personal basis, such as being able to lead, motivate, communicate, manage conflict and build
team rapport.
As mentioned in the section on leading, emotional intelligence forms an important component
of a manager’s tool set in applying interpersonal skills. It is recognised that there are some core
interpersonal skills, such as the ability to be:
interpersonal
skills those skills
used every day
to communicate
and interact with
other people,
both individually
and in groups
•
•
•
•
•
a team player and to work effectively with others, both in the internal and external
environments of the business
both empathic (understanding a situation from another’s point of view) and assertive (being
able to state your own requirements)
a good communicator
able to motivate and encourage others
ethical, honest and able to respect the values,
beliefs, aspirations and contributions of others.
For interpersonal relations to be maintained on
a positive level, managers need to be able to
manage conflict with stakeholders (both internal
and external). Often conflict can arise through
differences in the expectations, goals, needs and
wants of the manager and their subordinates.
A manager may want something to be done;
however, their subordinates want something else.
Should the manager adopt an aggressive, win-
at-any-cost approach? Alternatively, is it better
to adopt an assertive yet collaborative approach,
where both parties to the conflict can gain a
win? Adopting the second approach can turn the
potential area of conflict into one of agreement
between the parties.

on all levels.

The relationship between management
styles and management skills
Learning intentions – at the
end of this chapter section I
will be able to:
3.3.1 Identify and describe the relationship between
management styles and management skills
It is important that businesses have tools in place to be able to evaluate whether the
management style and skills adopted by a particular manager were appropriate when
managing a range of business situations.
Outlined in Table 3.15 are a range of situations where managers would need to determine
which management style, and related skills, was appropriate for the given situation. It is also
important to assess the effectiveness of a manager in their role in terms of managing both the
tasks to be completed and the staff for whom they are responsible.

Luigi Bocca is the owner and chief executive officer of an independent boutique supermarket
called Bocca located in one of Melbourne’s trendy inner suburbs. His shop is designed to cater
to the needs of the growing number of people living in inner-city apartments as well as people
still living in homes that they have owned for the last 20 or 30 years. To meet the changing
requirements of his customers, Luigi is now stocking a vast range of organic products alongside
the traditional offerings of fresh meat, fish, delicatessen products, bread, fruit and vegetables.
He also offers a wide range of ‘grab and go’ foods such as sandwiches, salads and sushi, and
ready-to-eat meals such as lasagne, ravioli, beef and lamb casseroles and curries with rice.
The trading hours of Bocca are 8 a.m. until 9 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and 10 a.m. until 7 p.m.
on Sunday.
Luigi opened Bocca in the early 1990s and since then the sales revenue of the business has been
steadily increasing. He also expanded the size of the store to now have a large retail footprint.
Luigi is now starting to think about reducing his working hours and ultimately entering his
retirement. He would like to spend more time travelling within Australia and back to Italy with
his wife Louisa. To make this transition happen, he knows that he needs to start sharing his
management role with other staff members, thus expanding the current management team,
which is made up of his daughter Annabel in the role of finance manager and accountant, his
eldest son Joseph in charge of the store’s IT systems, and his youngest son Alberto, who is the
operations manager.

The store employs 20 full-time staff who have worked at Bocca since its opening. These
employees have a very good understanding of how the business operates and act as
supervisors for the casual staff. Many of the full-time staff are advancing in age and are also
thinking of transitioning to retirement and will need to be replaced. The remaining members of
staff work on a casual basis. Some are students whose work rosters are arranged around their
study commitments at university or TAFE. Others are local people (male and female) who want
to work hours that fit around their family commitments.

enterprises
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
There are several different types of business ownership and legal structures.
A public sector business is owned by government.
A private sector business is owned by individuals.
The most common legal structures for businesses are:
— sole trader
—
— partnership
—
— company.
—
There are two types of company:
— private limited
—
— public listed.
—
A company is a separate legal entity to its owners/shareholders, who enjoy
the benefits of limited liability.
Social enterprises exist to pursue social and/or environmental goals.
Government business enterprises are government-owned (public sector)
enterprises that have adopted a corporate model.
•
Business objectives,
including to make
a profit, to increase
market share, to
improve efficiency, to
improve effectiveness,
to fulfil a market
need, to fulfil a
social need and to
meet shareholder
expectations
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
All businesses must establish aims or objectives.
Objectives should be set using the SMART principle.
Business objectives can be to make a profit, to increase market share, to
improve efficiency, to improve effectiveness, to fulfil a market need, to fulfil
a social need and to meet shareholder expectations.
Vision and mission statements are important for all businesses.
A values statement allows a business to focus on what is important in the
business related to its shared values and cultural priorities.
Stakeholders have expectations regarding the performance of a business.
It is important for businesses to continually revisit objectives and look at
ways to improve their other objectives.
•
Stakeholders of
businesses, including
owners, managers,
employees, customers,
suppliers and the
general community
•
•
Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have a direct or vested interest
in the activities of a business.
Stakeholders come from each level of the business environment (macro,
operating and internal).
•
Characteristics of
stakeholders of
businesses, including
their interests and
potential conflicts

•
•
•
Not all stakeholders have a positive interest in a business; some may in fact
be in conflict with the operations of a business.
Examples of stakeholders in a business are shareholders/owners, directors
(company) or partners, management, employees, trade unions, customers,
suppliers, creditors, competitors, community and government.
Stakeholders are increasingly concerned that businesses operate in an
ethical and socially responsible manner.

Key knowledge Summary
•
Management
styles, including
autocratic, persuasive,
consultative,
participative and
laissez-faire
•
•
•
•
Management style is the approach used to provide direction, implement
plans and motivate people.
There are a variety of management styles: autocratic, persuasive,
consultative, participative and laissez-faire.
The contingency or situational management approach applies a range of
variables that can be used to determine the appropriate style for a given set
of circumstances.
The variables are the nature of the task, the time frame, the level of experience
of the employees, any constraints (such as money or resources), the corporate
culture of the business and finally the preferred style of the manager.
•
The appropriateness
of management
styles in relation to
the nature of the task,
time, experience
of employees and
manager preference
•
The styles vary according to a range of characteristics. First, their degree of
centralisation relating to authority and decision-making. Second, the focus
or orientation they adopt, whether task achievement is of greater importance
than having satisfied employees or a combination of both. Third, their
belief in what acts to motivate employees: is it money or challenging and
interesting tasks? Fourth, the attitude of the manager to their subordinates:
do they believe they need to be directed in everything they do or do they
actually have trust and faith in their ability? Finally, the communication flow
differs between the styles, varying from closed (downward) to a totally open
flow in the participative style.
•
Management
skills, including
communication,
delegation, planning,
leading, decision-
making and
interpersonal
•
•
Management skills are the abilities or expertise required by a manager to
achieve their work.
A range of skills is required by managers regardless of their level in the
management hierarchy: communication, delegation, planning, leading,
decision-making and interpersonal.
•
The relationship
between management
styles and management
skills
•
The interrelationship that exists between management styles and skills
provides an opportunity for assessing whether management is effective.
•
Corporate culture, both
official and real
•
•
•
•
•
Corporate culture is an internal factor that management seeks to influence
with a view to optimisation of business performance.
Corporate culture refers to the shared values and beliefs of people within a
business.
Official corporate culture refers to the set of values and beliefs desired by
the management of a business.
Real/unofficial culture refers to the culture that actually prevails in a business.
The following factors are keys to developing the desired corporate culture
within a business organisation:
— mission, vision and values statements
—
— management structure
—
— management style
—
— policies and procedures
—
— business documentation and forms of communication used
—
— the people within the business
—
— the physical environment and material symbols within the business
—
— stories, narratives and rituals shared within the business.

90 Unit 3 | Managing a business
Sample examination questions and advice
Unit 3 Area of Study 1: Business foundations
In this Area of Study, students are introduced to the key characteristics of businesses and their
stakeholders. They investigate potential conflicts between the different demands of stakeholders on a
business. Corporate culture and a range of management styles and skills that may be used when managing
a business are also examined and applied to contemporary business case studies from the past four years.
Outcome 1 requires students to be able to analyse the key characteristics of businesses, their
stakeholders, management styles and skills, and their corporate culture.
Question 1
Mick and Richard are partners in Leaf Inventions. They have decided that, rather than continuing to
operate in their current legal structure of a partnership, they will incorporate their business and form
a company. They are, however, uncertain whether to incorporate to become a private limited or public
listed company.
Discuss the implications for the business, Leaf Inventions, if its owners decide to become a private
company rather than being publicly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. (4 marks)
Extended response question – let’s unpack it

A possible answer to Question 1 might be:
Sample response
By adopting the legal structure of a company, regardless of whether private limited or public
listed, Mick and Richard will gain certain advantages. One important implication related to
adopting either form of company structure is that it provides Mick and Richard (as shareholders)
the protection of creating a separate legal entity and therefore limiting their liability for any
debts incurred by the business. It also provides them with perpetuity (ongoing life) for their
business. Establishing the business as a public listed company will, however, provide greater
opportunity for Leaf Inventions to raise capital through having the ability to have a larger
number of shareholders in the business, as it will be listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.
While both forms of company structure must ensure that they adhere to legal and compliance
requirements, these are less onerous and less costly for a private limited company.
Marking guide:
•
No marks for a response that only defines the characteristics of a company
•
2–3 marks for a response that states and discusses arguments covering both forms of
company structure
•
To gain full marks (4 marks), you will need to state and discuss arguments covering implications for
adopting both forms of company structure and include reference to the stimulus material (i.e. Mick
and Richard and Leaf Inventions).
Question 2
Mick and Richard, owners of Leaf Inventions, have decided to become a private limited company.

that may arise due to the changed legal structure of the business. (4 marks)

Hints:
•
•
•
Identify relevant stakeholders to the business.
Choose two stakeholders and describe their interest. (Remember, there are many stakeholders for
a business – owners, managers, employees, customers, suppliers and the general community.)
Determine any potential areas of conflict.
A possible answer to Question 2 might be:
Sample response
Two stakeholders, being either an individual or a group, who have a vested interest in the
activities of Leaf Inventions are firstly its shareholders, who would be looking for the business to
be profitable and to provide dividends to them based on their shareholding. An area of conflict
could arise when Mick and Richard, who are now shareholders, want to retain funds within the
business to assist with its future growth, whereas the other shareholders (owners) would like to
receive a large dividend yield on their investment.
A second stakeholder to the business is the government, which wants to ensure that
the company is correctly registered, is paying the correct forms of taxation, is making
superannuation contributions on behalf of its staff and is compliant with any specific regulations
relating to operating a company. Conflict may arise between the company and the government
if any of the above requirements are not adequately met or are breached.
Marking guide:
•
1 mark for identifying two relevant stakeholders
•
2 marks for description of two relevant stakeholders and nature of interest
•
3–4 marks for description of two relevant stakeholders, nature of interest and possible areas of
conflict.
Question 3
Mick is chief finance officer and Richard is operations manager of Leaf Inventions Pty Ltd. It is the
aim of the business to enter a period of growth, and to achieve this they have each agreed the most
appropriate management style for them to adopt is consultative.

Hints:
•
•
This question has multiple parts (management styles and skills) and requires all parts to be
completed to gain full marks.
There are a range of other skills that could be identified and justified, including delegation,
leadership, decision-making and interpersonal.
A possible answer to Question 3a might be:
Sample response
The consultative management style is characterised by the manager exercising centralised
control and authority while taking account of the ideas and concepts provided by employees,
particularly in relation to making decisions. The manager considers task achievement to be an
important factor, but also understands the importance of the ‘people factor’, which results in
employees becoming more motivated and wanting to perform to their best.
Two management skills that would be important are communication and planning.
Communication that is open and encourages discussion and feedback would be essential.
It would be in the form of top-down information and directions by management (Mick
and Richard) to employees (subordinates) related to their growth plans. Upward flow of
communication from the employees to management would then be able to provide valuable
options and feedback relating to expansion plans.
Planning is a skill that relates to future-oriented decision-making. It involves understanding
the purpose or aims of the business, then formulating various levels of objectives, plans and
strategies to meet the desired outcome. This skill is therefore important if Mick and Richard wish
to embark on a growth strategy for their business.
Marking guide:
•
2 marks for describing the key characteristics of the consultative style
•
3 marks for identifying and justifying two management skills that relate to growing the business.

Requires breaking the style into parts and examining the relationship of this style to
corporate culture.
A possible answer to Question 3b might be:
Sample response
Corporate culture relates to the shared values and beliefs held within a business. By adopting
a consultative management style, Mick and Richard are demonstrating that they want to set
the approach the business will be taking, as they wish to remain in control of its operations,
its communication flow and therefore its official culture. However, by adopting this style they
demonstrate that they value their employees and wish them to be motivated and contribute to
the success of the business.

To gain full marks, students need to establish the impact of characteristics of the style on the
corporate culture of the business.

QUESTION TYPES: Predict outcomes, solve problems, apply procedures, use in scenarios.
STEMS: "What would happen if...", "In this situation, you would...", "Apply X to solve...", "Predict the result..."
REQUIRE: Novel scenarios not seen in teaching materials. Test transfer of learning.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can identify and name the five management styles on the continuum from task-oriented to people-oriented
CODE: 3.1.1

WHAT (concept explanation):
The five management styles are autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire. They sit on a continuum from task-oriented (autocratic) to people-oriented (laissez-faire).

WHY (importance):
Recognising where each style sits on the continuum helps you quickly compare them and understand their underlying philosophy.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
If asked to arrange styles from most to least centralised, the order would be: autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative, laissez-faire.

SUBTOPIC: Management Styles
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the five management styles — autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire — and their key characteristics. It examines how each style differs in terms of control, communication, decision-making and employee orientation.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the distinct features of each management style is essential for analysing how businesses are run. Being able to identify and describe these styles is a foundational skill tested in SACs and exams.

TOPIC: Management styles and skills
SUBJECT: Business Management | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3

CHAPTER OVERVIEW
Managing a business of any size can be a complex and challenging
task for the business’s owners and managers. The majority of
businesses will establish as one of their main objectives ‘growing the
value of the business’. The leaders or senior managers of that business
must set a clear vision and be able to continually communicate the
vision. Their role is to then get out of the way and let the second-line
managers do their job. The choice of management style and skills
adopted by these managers will differ. Ideally, the style and skills
adopted should be appropriate to the situation within the business.

style the manner

people
A management style, broadly speaking, is the manner and approach of providing direction,
implementing plans and motivating people that is adopted by a manager. There are distinctly
different styles of management: autocratic, persuasive, consultative, participative and laissez-faire.
Management styles can have specific features. For example, the way managers interact with
employees will depend on how they exercise authority, the degree of task or employee
orientation, and the manner of communication (‘top-down’, ‘bottom-up’ or lateral). The type of
management structure adopted by the business in order to achieve its goals and objectives,
such as bureaucratic (multilayered), a flatter structure or a team-based structure, will also
impact on the style chosen.
Most managers use a range of styles based on the situation that is required to be managed, their
own (manager’s) personality, the characteristics of their subordinates and any time constraints.
For instance, if a manager wanted to introduce 12-hour shifts to raise productivity by increasing
the utilisation of expensive plant and equipment, it is unlikely that an autocratic task-oriented
style would be effective in managing this situation. A participative or consultative management
style, where employee input was sought and considered before making a decision, would be
more appropriate.
Management styles can be demonstrated using a continuum of management approaches
based on their orientation towards the task or employees/people. At one end of the continuum,
the importance of the task outweighs that of the employees/people. The other end places
greater importance on the people, while not forgetting the importance of task achievement.

Types of management style
Management style refers to the different ways in which managers behave. The preferred style
of a manager will depend on many factors, such as cultural styles of leadership and the type
of business.
Autocratic management style
Autocratic management style (authoritarian) is often referred to as the classical
management style.
The characteristics of the autocratic management style are outlined in Table 3.1.

is one-way –
downwards
Managers want to be in control and retain authority, particularly
when undertaking planning, coordinating and monitoring various
human and physical activities of the business. They want to be the
main person guiding employees towards achieving the objectives
of the business.
Task-oriented Great importance is placed on achieving the task and following
established process. Policies and procedures are maintained in
detail and enforced by frequent checks.
Motivating factor Main motivator for work performance is payment (i.e. money)
Decision-making Centralised and controlled by the manager with decision or
orders then passed on or told to subordinates
Employees’ contribution Little value is placed on the importance of the employees’
contribution to the overall performance of the business. The
objectives, aims and operating environments reflect the ideas,
beliefs and values of the manager.
Communication Centralised with a strict top-down or hierarchical chain-of-
command approach to management

and worker

is non-existent
An autocratic manager has a high regard for production and efficiency (task-oriented).
Managers expect team members to comply with their decisions and they are not concerned
with the attitude or thinking of the group. This can result in passive resistance from team
members, which requires the manager to then apply continual pressure and direction in
order to get things done. If this style is adopted by the CEO of a business, it can result in high-
potential employees and even members of the senior management team walking out the door
because their ideas and views are not being heard. Managers adopting this style often use
punishment and rewards to achieve their objectives.

Table 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages of an autocratic management style
Advantages Disadvantages
Decision-making is quick, as only one person
needs to be involved
A quick decision is not always the best
decision
Decisions are made by an experienced leader Discourages teamwork; employees’ opinions
and input are not sought
Communication is direct Does not allow for open communication and
feedback on ideas
Roles and expectations of employees are
defined and monitored
Low motivation and job satisfaction, as
workers are not empowered; staff turnover
may increase when staff feel undervalued
High regard for production and efficiency Too task-focused, with insufficient regard for
employees as people with needs; does not
take account of needs of generations X and Y
and baby boomer employees
Suits high-risk or difficult decisions (e.g.
closure of business operations, retrenchment
of staff)
Creates feelings of unease and being ‘kept
in the dark’; can create a ‘them’ versus
‘us’ attitude
One industry that focuses on results and efficiency as being paramount is hospitality – in
particular, restaurants. Diners expect to receive timely, orderly service and quality food, while
restaurants are generally being run on slim margins, relying heavily on positive reviews and
return customers. Their business will suffer even from small mistakes. In the kitchen, it can be
the head chef adopting all the characteristics of an autocratic manager, ordering and ruling over
the kitchen staff with an iron hand. One extreme example is renowned chef Gordon Ramsay.
The maître d’hôtel responsible for the waiting staff will often also adopt this style.

Persuasive management style
A persuasive management style is that of a manager who uses their ability to interpret
a situation, people’s actions and dialogue, and then strongly urges or convinces them to
do a task or achieve objectives the manager’s way. This style has many characteristics in
common with the autocratic style. The main difference between the styles, however, is
that once a persuasive manager makes a decision, they then try to convince a subordinate
that what was decided by the manager is in the subordinate’s best interests. For example,
a marketing department manager who has an idea for increasing sales targets will try to
convince the rest of the marketing team that only their idea will improve the sales targets.

This type of manager will try to bring people around to their own view, while sticking to
their decision with or without agreement. Under this type of management style, employees
will have a better idea of what to do when there is a change externally or internally,
because the manager has explained their intentions.
The characteristics of the persuasive management style are outlined in Table 3.3.

Characteristic Description
Control and authority Centralised
Task-oriented Great importance on achieving the task and following the established

Employees’ contribution Some value placed on contribution of employees to overall
performance of the business. The objectives, aims and operating
environments still, however, reflect the ideas, beliefs and values of
the manager.

Consultative management style
A consultative management style takes into
account the opinions of team members before
making a decision. This style is moving further
along the continuum from being purely task-
centred to taking the people/employees more
into account. For example, a school principal
may ask the student leadership group, parents
and staff for their suggestions on a new uniform,
then consider all the arguments and make a
decision on the type of uniform that will be
introduced. Another example is when a team
leader of a project holds weekly meetings with
the team members where they are given the
opportunity to share progress of their job tasks
and responsibilities. The meetings allow team
members the opportunity to provide feedback
on areas needing improvement. The team leader
can then use this feedback to review and set
schedules, allocate resources and prioritise tasks
and goals for the coming week.
The characteristics of the consultative
management style are outlined in Table 3.5.
Figure 3.2 A consultative manager seeks input from
their staff.

Control and authority Centralised and exercised by the manager. More employee-based
and less centralised than autocratic and persuasive styles. Ideas and

Reasonable level of employee involvement Time-consuming if many stakeholders are
consulted
Acts to motivate and increase an employee’s
level of job satisfaction
Employees may still not feel valued if they
have provided their ideas but these are
overlooked
Participative management style
The participative management style has become very popular because it focuses on the
interaction between management and employees. This style keeps employees informed about
issues that affect their work, with management and employees sharing in decision-making
and problem-solving tasks. The manager is now acting more as a coach who gets their team of
employees to work together to improve the overall performance of the business. The manager
does not delegate away responsibility, as they still are entitled to have the final say.
The characteristics of the participative management style are outlined in Table 3.7.

Control and authority Decentralised approach. Corporate objectives, while determined

Laissez-faire management style
The laissez-faire management style can also be
called ‘free-rein’ or ‘hands-off’ style. It is a style in which
management provides little direction to employees.
Management’s involvement and responsibility often
relate to outlining budgetary constraints, coordinating
timelines and ensuring that broad corporate objectives
are achieved. Employees are then empowered to
determine their own objectives, solve their own
problems and make their own decisions.

This style is commonly found in workplaces where the employees are highly educated, skilled
and experienced. This group of employees require little direction and have their own motivation
(drive) to accomplish, and take pride in their accomplishments. It is also found in businesses
that are in the ‘start-up’ phase or incubator phase of product development. Examples of
businesses where the laissez-faire management style could work well are advertising agencies,
product design firms, start-up social media businesses, and specialised engineering, medical
research or architectural businesses. For instance, a manager of a website development
company could entrust the website designers to work independently with little interference
from the manager when fulfilling the customer’s needs. Group members would be allowed to
perform as they like, so far as this does not violate the objectives and policies of the business,
and tasks are completed within budgets and agreed timelines. This style also suits the dynamic
nature of an advertising company where creative freedom is very important.
Table 3.9 Advantages and disadvantages of the laissez-faire management style
Advantages Disadvantages
High employee independence, as employees
can set their own tasks with little involvement
from management
Lack of guidance can cause some employees
to have a sense of loss of direction
Strong motivation, empowerment and job
satisfaction for employees
Some employees may feel unsettled by the
freedom of this style
Good environment for encouraging creativity
and innovation
Does not suit employees who are unskilled or

1 Identify potential workplaces where a laissez-faire management style would not work
particularly well.
2 Explain how a laissez-faire style might suit employees who work well in both team and
autonomous work situations.
Contingency or situational management approach
Business environments (external and internal) are constantly changing, including innovations in
product development and fast delivery of goods. Businesses need to respond to these changes
in order to compete against other businesses, and this can then impact on the management
style adopted by the manager. In a contingency (situational) management approach,
managers must take into account all aspects of the current external and internal circumstances
and act on those aspects that are important to the situation that has arisen. The manager
demonstrates flexibility in these circumstances, which is a response known as ‘contingency
approach’. It benefits the business because it provides the potential for managers to learn

This approach works by applying a range of variables to assist in selecting the most appropriate
management style for managing a given situation. The following are considered:
•
•
•
•
•
the manager’s personality, characteristics or qualities, their values and skills, and how they
communicate with staff
their subordinates’ (employees’) characteristics, such as their level of knowledge, skills,
experience and values
the tasks that need to be completed by the team or business – are they complex, simple or
repetitive?
the constraints, such as time, money and resource availability
the corporate culture of the business and the relationships between management and staff.
As a result of various forces or situations, managers may not use any one particular
management style. Rather, a manager could use a variety of management styles as outlined in
the following situations:
•
•
An authoritarian style would be appropriate where there are a number of new and unskilled
employees who need to learn a job. The manager would need to keep tight control of the
situation and teach the new employees what their job entails in as short a time as possible in
order for them to become productive.
The participative management style would best suit the project manager of a group
of experienced, motivated employees working as a project team who are capable of
accomplishing the project objectives within the established time frame.

increase in the share price occurred, with a
share’s value now being in excess of $47.
Premier Retail owns a suite of retail brands and
chain stores that includes Just Jeans, Dotti,
Smiggle, Peter Alexander, Portmans, Jacqui E
and Jay Jays. Premier Retail trades from more
than 1200 stores located in seven countries. It
also has a wholesale and online presence.

conversations, meet for coffee and make
connections while also getting out and visiting
the JB Hi-Fi and Good Guys stores.
When appointing Murray to the position of
CEO, Chairman of the Premier Retail board,
Solomon Lew, described him as ‘one of the
best retailers in Australia’, having delivered
significant growth, transformation and
shareholder value during his career at JB Hi-Fi

For each of the following scenarios, propose an appropriate management style, describe its
characteristics and provide two reasons to justify your suggestion.
1 Ian is an experienced business analyst at a major bank. He has been appointed as project
manager of a team of four employees who have the task of developing and implementing
a new risk management policy. His team members have been drawn from a variety of
functional areas within the bank (e.g. retail banking, information technology, legal and
finance). All members of his team are highly skilled and knowledgeable and capable of
working unsupervised. Ian does, however, feel that final decisions must be checked by him
before they present the new risk management policy to senior management for approval
prior to implementation.
2 Safiya decided that she wanted to start up and run a social media company. At university
she had studied a double degree – Business Studies (majoring in Marketing) and Computer
Science. While working in casual jobs during her five years of study, she found that she did

Skills are the ability to do something well, gained through training and experience, in order to
achieve the required goal. A close relationship exists between management styles and skills,
with certain management styles placing greater emphasis on different skills.
In addition, effective management requires a manager of any business to be capable of
producing an outcome that meets or exceeds accepted ethical standards. In achieving the
outcome, the manager should not undertake activities that are against their deeply held
moral values.

Communication skills
A renowned management consultant and author, Peter Drucker, said: ‘Management is doing
things right; leadership is doing the right things.’ He believed that the most important thing
in communication is to hear what isn’t being said: ‘Unless commitment is made, there are only
promises and hopes; but no plans.’
Communication skills are essential, as managers must be able to clarify with employees
the tasks required to be undertaken and completed. The main forms of communication that
managers will be involved in are:
•
•
•
personal communication – which involves sharing information and understanding between
the manager and a subordinate or a small group or work team. It is estimated that managers
spend between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of their work time in conversation. Therefore, it is
extremely important that they are effective in their interpersonal communication.
internal organisational communication – where systems are used to inform and share
information with employees (internal stakeholders) of the business. For instance, an
organisational chart can be used by management to inform employees about how the
business is structured, its functional areas, chain of command and communication channels.
Policy and procedure manuals are also used to inform employees about the way that the
business conducts itself.
external operational communication – which occurs when managers need to communicate
with stakeholders external to the business. It involves transmitting information to customers,
suppliers, investors, shareholders (if a company) and the community.

Figure 3.6 Main forms of communication used by managers
To achieve the vision of the business, open communication is vital if a manager wishes to
gain employee involvement in the expression and development of ideas. Frustration, lack
of motivation, inadequate direction and poor feedback between management and its
subordinates can result from weak or restricted communication flow.
A manager will be required to use a variety of forms of communication, such as:
•
reading – managers need to be able to locate, understand and interpret written data and
information, such as letters, reports, emails, documents, policies, procedures, codes of
practice, contracts and graphs

•
•
writing – to express thoughts and ideas, information and messages through emails, word-
processing documents, manuals and reports
speaking – to communicate orally by talking to people individually or in groups (small
or large) to disseminate information and gain feedback. Listening to oral messages is an
essential form of communication as a manager receives, attends to, interprets and responds
to oral messages. If managers do not develop the skill of listening, they may not hear the
suggestions or information from the most valuable employees.
ACTIVITY 3.5
Scenario 1
Aussie Home Delivery is a food home delivery business that has supplied fresh dairy, meat,
bread, vegetables and fruit to homes on a weekly basis for the past 10 years. Its general manager
needs to advise its staff that, due to increased competition from the online ordering and delivery
facility now provided by the major food retailers, Aussie Home Delivery will need to close down
its business. This closure will result in all its valued staff being made redundant.
Scenario 2
Chen owns and operates a
bakery in a busy strip shopping
centre in suburban Melbourne.
The bakery operates seven
days a week, with baking staff
starting work at 4 a.m. each day.
The business employs three
qualified and very experienced
bakers, three apprentice bakers
and eight shop assistants. To
ensure that the business runs
smoothly, Chen needs to plan
to have sufficient basic supplies
(flour and yeast) and any special
ingredients, such as dried fruit,
nuts, salami, pineapple and
mushrooms, in stock so they can
prepare and bake their selection
of baked items for sale each day.
He must also make sure that
all equipment, such as ovens,
dough-making machinery and
refrigerators, is in working order.
Figure 3.7 The owner and staff at a busy bakery need to effectively communicate with all its
stakeholders.
Chen now works on a part-time basis and is planning to fully retire from the business in the
next couple of years. To ensure that the business still runs productively, he must communicate
with his staff on matters such as their days and hours of work. Additionally, at the end of trade
each day, he needs to be advised of the bakery’s daily sales and stock levels so that stock can
be replenished. Chen is aware that he must ensure that his staff are trained and understand
health and safety requirements, as the business is regularly visited by the local council health
inspectors. With the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become important that he ensures that all staff
wear their face masks and that they actively control the number of customers permitted into the
shop at any one time.
Read the above two scenarios and recommend the form(s) of communication that you believe
would be most effective. Justify your choice.

Delegation
Delegation is the process where formal authority is passed down the hierarchy of a business.
It can occur at all levels and types and sizes of business. For example, a senior manager will
delegate to middle management, who will then delegate further down the chain of command
to front-line managers, who will then instruct the workers in their tasks. In a small business,
it may occur when the owner of a shoe shop authorises (delegates to) the floor staff to take
delivery of the newly arrived stock, check that all stock stated on the delivery note is exactly
what has been delivered, price the stock and then display it on the shelves ready for sale.
The authority to delegate needs to come right from the top of the business. If the business is a
company, then the shareholders, upon electing the board of directors, assign to them the right
or power to delegate to the chief executive officer and senior management the running of the
business. If the business is a sole trader or partnership, the authority will come from the owner
or partners.
Analysis: determine the tasks to be delegated
Appointment: nominate subordinate to
whom task is to be allocated
Briefing: define the task to be delegated
Control: monitor and encourage person
undertaking task
Appraisal: review and revise

extent to which

managers for

The acceptance of authority by a person indicates their acceptance of responsibility and
accountability. Responsibility remains with the manager or person to whom it is assigned, and
the only way that manager or person can be released from that responsibility is if a superior
takes it away.
If authority is retained by senior management or the business owner and not delegated, it is
said to be centralised, whereas authority passed down to the lower levels of the business is said
to be decentralised.
While delegation is a skill in itself, it is also a process that requires other skills to make it
effective, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the ability to analyse a job and have a clear understanding of what authority is required to
carry out the various parts of the job
the ability to establish performance standards
the ability to set realistic checkpoints and deadlines for tasks
the ability to select appropriate people to perform the delegated tasks
good communication skills
the ability to assess completed delegated tasks and provide feedback, in the form of praise
or further advice, to subordinates.

Benefits of delegation
Assists in the smooth flow of
production and work processes,
as work will continue even in
the absence of the owner or
manager
Acts as a time-saver, freeing
management to be involved in
longer-term planning and
more important tasks
Figure 3.9 Benefits of delegation
Not all tasks and actions to be undertaken by management are suitable for delegation.
Table 3.10 identifies some of those tasks that are suited to delegation and others where
delegation would be ill-advised.
Table 3.10 Examples of tasks suited to and not suited to delegation
Provides an opportunity for skill
training, personal development
and job satisfaction
for employees
Shows trust and faith in
employees’ abilities
Tasks suited to delegation Tasks not suited to delegation
Tasks that form part of a larger project Strategic planning
Repetitive or time-consuming tasks High-risk decisions
The collection or organisation of data High-cost decisions
Training and development of subordinates Confidential matters
Highly specialised areas requiring specific
training
Similarly, not all managers or business owners are good at delegating. There may be a variety of
reasons for this, including:
•
insecurity or fear that the subordinate to whom they have delegated a task may let
them down
•
feeling threatened that it might show up their inadequacies if the subordinate does too
good a job
•
being too disorganised or inflexible in how they organise their own work
•
being focused too heavily on the short-term achievement of work deadlines and therefore
thinking it is quicker to do the job themselves
•
a lack of trust and faith in their subordinates’ abilities
•
a desire for their own power and therefore being reluctant to relinquish authority as it might
make them feel less important
•
subordinates lacking confidence, training or experience or perhaps not wanting to accept
responsibility for any delegated tasks.

Planning
Planning is described as a decision-making process that is future-oriented. It involves
understanding the purpose or mission of a business and formulating the various levels of
objectives for the business. Factors drawn from various levels of the business environment can
cause uncertainty for a business. Undertaking planning assists a business to reduce these levels
of uncertainty. Steps in the planning process are outlined in Table 3.11.
Table 3.11 Steps in the planning process
Steps Explanation
1 Set the goal(s) When establishing goals, consider the values held by
management and approach of the business to its social
responsibility
2 Gather information
using SWOT
Analyse the internal and external environment of the business. A
SWOT analysis (Figure 3.11) is a common tool used to undertake
this information gathering.

and restraining factors
Determine the possible opportunities and threats or problems
that face the business currently or in the future
4 Develop the action plan

Create the strategies (courses of action) to take advantage of the
opportunities. Contingency plans may be needed to deal with
identified threats.

ACTIVITY 3.6
The principal and school council of your school are looking at the strategic direction of the
school. As important stakeholders of the school, they would like you to apply your knowledge to
undertake a SWOT analysis of the school. The results of this analysis will assist school council to
formulate the strategic plans for the school. This activity can be undertaken as an individual or
class task.
Planning is generally ‘organised’ in a hierarchical structure,
with the overall direction coming from the top level of
a business. For a company, this is the board of directors
and senior management, while for a smaller business the
owner or business partners would represent this level.
Planning is categorised into three levels: strategic, tactical
and operational.
Strategic planning is the formal, long-term (two to
five years) planning process that establishes the overall
direction of the business. It is undertaken by the owner
of a small business or the senior management team of a
larger company. The planning decisions made at this level
will impact on the type of structure the business adopts,
and its values, business philosophies, strategic direction
and objectives.
Figure 3.12 Planning is essential for reducing uncertainty
in business.
Tactical planning is the formal, medium-term (one to two years) planning undertaken by
middle management to implement the strategic plan of the business. This level of planning
occurs within each department or functional area of a business and its aim is to bring the
objectives of the business into reality.
Operational planning is the lowest level of planning and relates to setting goals and creating
and implementing plans for small groups, teams or individual employees of a business. It
involves the planning of operations on a daily, monthly or up to one-year basis by front-line
managers or supervisors within the business. They will be making plans to achieve goals such
as increasing efficiency, reducing mistakes and reorganising or improving the work processes
of people within their work team. Planning at this level will relate to activities such as staffing
rosters, ordering of supplies and production output schedules.

Leading
Businesses, regardless of size, need managers to be able
to lead and control the business’s activities. A good leader
knows when to step in and when to step away and allow
talented people they have hired to achieve the business’s
future potential. Businesspeople, whether they are
entrepreneurs who founded a business or operators of
small and medium-sized businesses, need to understand
that if they cannot relinquish some control of their
business, its growth will be stunted and its full potential
never realised.

Leading involves influencing others towards attaining the objectives of the business. Effective
leading requires a manager to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
establish conditions that motivate, engage and inspire subordinates
be a good communicator
act as a role model who is creative, curious, humble, caring and trustworthy, and uses power
effectively
understand those whom they are going to lead: their personalities, values, attitudes and
emotions
be able to build teams
inspire loyalty, dedication and commitment in those they lead
resolve conflicts
act as a mentor
be able to respond quickly and appropriately to change and help others to do the same.

emotional
intelligence
(EI) the ability
to perceive,

emotions in
ourselves and
others
Learning to lead takes time, and it can be assisted by understanding the theory of emotional
intelligence (EI). In 2002, Daniel Goleman, a psychologist, helped develop this theory. The
relationship between being effective in leading and emotional intelligence is very close. When
leading, a manager needs to ensure that tasks are completed successfully and the team of
subordinates under their control is kept together. In addition, they must ensure that each
individual in that team is happy and contributing on an individual basis to the successful
outcome of the team.
The EI theory incorporates a set of competencies that allows a manager to perceive, understand
and regulate emotions in themselves and in others. For a manager to be judged as having
excellent leadership skills, attending to the competencies outlined in Table 3.12 would be
essential.
Table 3.12 Five competencies linked to excellent leadership skills
Essential competencies Explanation
Emotional self-awareness Knowing what one is feeling at any given time and understanding
the impact those moods have on others
Self-regulation Controlling or redirecting one’s emotions, anticipating
consequences before acting on impulse
Motivation Utilising emotional factors to achieve goals, enjoying the learning
process and persevering in the face of obstacles
Empathy Sensing the emotions of others
Social skills Managing relationships, inspiring others and inducing desired
responses from them
Businesses function more effectively when they operate as a team. These teams may occur at
various levels; for instance, the senior management team establishes the strategic direction
for the business. Within any business there will be project teams and natural work groups. It
is important that team leadership skills are exhibited by the team leader, whether leading a
project team or a work group, to ensure the success of the team in achieving their objectives.

Teamwork is best understood as a set of behaviours that two or more people demonstrate
when working on some common task or pursuing a common objective. Employees are more
likely to share the vision and objectives of a business if they participate as a team, particularly in
the problem-solving and the decision-making processes. When people listen carefully to each
other, seek and take seriously each other’s opinions, and make use of each other’s competencies
and expertise, they are involved in teamwork. Teamwork encourages open communication,
improves morale, workplace cooperation and productivity, and develops a positive corporate
culture. Team leadership skills are therefore important for a manager to be able to guide and
direct this powerful business tool: teams.
ACTIVITY 3.8
Think of a leader you hold in high regard.
1 Working in pairs, identify two people from your community – they could be involved in
business, music, sport, politics or your school – who you consider to be ‘good leaders’.
2 Referring to the list below, identify and analyse what you consider are the traits that you
value and admire the most in each leader:
•
that they are authentic, trustworthy, reliable and demonstrate integrity in their actions
•
that they treat people fairly and are empathetic in their treatment of others
•
that they are decisive and know their own mind, taking time before deciding on an issue
and then sticking to their convictions
•
that they are a strategic thinker and happy to be around for a long time and deal with
big issues
•
that they demonstrate a high level of transparency, meaning they share information
with their staff, are trustworthy and able to communicate, and are willing to be
accountable for their actions
•
that they are accessible, friendly and welcoming even though they are very busy people.

Decision-making
In the day-to-day operations of a business, a manager or business owner can be faced with
numerous problems they need to overcome and decisions they need to make resulting from
changes in the macro, operating and internal environments. Some of these decisions will in
fact be routine and not require much deliberation. In other cases, decision-making may be
more difficult or complex and require more time and thought to be put into the process before
arriving at the final decision. These are the sorts of decisions that involve the factors outlined in
Table 3.13.

High level of uncertainty Many of the facts surrounding the problem or issue are unknown
Complexity A number of interrelated factors need consideration
High-risk consequences Resulting from the outcome of the decision
Interpersonal Issues related to how people involved in the decision will react
Possible alternatives Choices to be reviewed are numerous
Using a systematic process when trying to reach a decision reduces the likelihood of overlooking
important factors that should be considered. Outlined in Table 3.14 is a six-step process for effective
decision-making. The decision-making skill requires managers to recognise problems and then
become resourceful in seeking help from others to think critically, creatively and reflectively, and
to adapt to alternative solutions. Managers who undertake this process understand that a quick
solution will not work to resolve a complex issue. They spend time analysing the problem from all
angles and are open and honest in communicating with those involved.
Table 3.14 Systematic approach to decision-making
Steps Explanation
1  Identify the problem and
define the objectives
Be sure to identify and define the actual problem or issue needing resolution
2  Gather the necessary
information to establish
the cause of the problem
Investigate the circumstances surrounding the issue and search for factors that may
have created the problem. Once all the information is gathered, reassess the problem
to see if it is the same.

3  Develop alternative
solutions
The existence of some choice is necessary for effective decision-making. Develop
creative and imaginative possible solutions to the problem. However, retaining the
status quo is always one alternative.
4 Analyse the alternatives Rank and sort the different alternatives. Each alternative must be evaluated in terms
of its strengths and weaknesses, benefits, costs, advantages and disadvantages in
achieving objectives of the team, department or business.
5  Choose an alternative and
implement it
Management needs to decide the best outcome, given the conditions under which the
decision has to be made. Management must communicate clearly the decision that has
been taken, the required results and personnel associated with its implementation.
6  Evaluate the
implementation
Provide feedback on progress, making the necessary adjustments. Evaluation enables
managers to learn from experience and improve their further decision-making and
problem-solving skills.

Develop alternatives
In some cases, the decision-making process may reflect
a strong team involvement at the discussion stage of the

effort, or it may require an individual to make a decision. This
depends largely on the complexity of the issue, the leader’s
management style and the structure of the business.

Scenario
Oaktree is a nursery operating in regional Victoria. The business has been run by horticulturalist
Andrew and his wife Jacqueline for 15 years. Over the years, they have built up the business and are
well known in the area for the quality of their plants and also for the advice they give to gardeners.
They now need to decide whether to keep the business as a nursery or broaden its operation to
include a cafe where people can come and enjoy meals throughout the day. Jacqueline is happy
to be responsible for running that side of the business. She believes that by opening the cafe they
will attract not only locals but also ‘day-trippers’ as their town is only 90 minutes from Melbourne.
Operating as both a garden centre and a cafe will provide Oaktree with dual income streams;
however, consideration needs to be given to the cost involved in setting up this new venture.
Task
The owners of Oaktree, Andrew and Jacqueline, have asked you to assist them to decide whether they
should undertake this new venture. Demonstrate your understanding of decision-making by including
the theoretical steps of the decision-making process as well as linking each step to the scenario.

Interpersonal
Interpersonal skills are those skills used by a manager when dealing with people on a
personal basis, such as being able to lead, motivate, communicate, manage conflict and build
team rapport.
As mentioned in the section on leading, emotional intelligence forms an important component
of a manager’s tool set in applying interpersonal skills. It is recognised that there are some core
interpersonal skills, such as the ability to be:
interpersonal
skills those skills
used every day
to communicate
and interact with
other people,
both individually
and in groups
•
•
•
•
•
a team player and to work effectively with others, both in the internal and external
environments of the business
both empathic (understanding a situation from another’s point of view) and assertive (being
able to state your own requirements)
a good communicator
able to motivate and encourage others
ethical, honest and able to respect the values,
beliefs, aspirations and contributions of others.
For interpersonal relations to be maintained on
a positive level, managers need to be able to
manage conflict with stakeholders (both internal
and external). Often conflict can arise through
differences in the expectations, goals, needs and
wants of the manager and their subordinates.
A manager may want something to be done;
however, their subordinates want something else.
Should the manager adopt an aggressive, win-
at-any-cost approach? Alternatively, is it better
to adopt an assertive yet collaborative approach,
where both parties to the conflict can gain a
win? Adopting the second approach can turn the
potential area of conflict into one of agreement
between the parties.

on all levels.

Luigi Bocca is the owner and chief executive officer of an independent boutique supermarket
called Bocca located in one of Melbourne’s trendy inner suburbs. His shop is designed to cater
to the needs of the growing number of people living in inner-city apartments as well as people
still living in homes that they have owned for the last 20 or 30 years. To meet the changing
requirements of his customers, Luigi is now stocking a vast range of organic products alongside
the traditional offerings of fresh meat, fish, delicatessen products, bread, fruit and vegetables.
He also offers a wide range of ‘grab and go’ foods such as sandwiches, salads and sushi, and
ready-to-eat meals such as lasagne, ravioli, beef and lamb casseroles and curries with rice.
The trading hours of Bocca are 8 a.m. until 9 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and 10 a.m. until 7 p.m.
on Sunday.
Luigi opened Bocca in the early 1990s and since then the sales revenue of the business has been
steadily increasing. He also expanded the size of the store to now have a large retail footprint.
Luigi is now starting to think about reducing his working hours and ultimately entering his
retirement. He would like to spend more time travelling within Australia and back to Italy with
his wife Louisa. To make this transition happen, he knows that he needs to start sharing his
management role with other staff members, thus expanding the current management team,
which is made up of his daughter Annabel in the role of finance manager and accountant, his
eldest son Joseph in charge of the store’s IT systems, and his youngest son Alberto, who is the
operations manager.

The store employs 20 full-time staff who have worked at Bocca since its opening. These
employees have a very good understanding of how the business operates and act as
supervisors for the casual staff. Many of the full-time staff are advancing in age and are also
thinking of transitioning to retirement and will need to be replaced. The remaining members of
staff work on a casual basis. Some are students whose work rosters are arranged around their
study commitments at university or TAFE. Others are local people (male and female) who want
to work hours that fit around their family commitments.

There are several different types of business ownership and legal structures.
A public sector business is owned by government.
A private sector business is owned by individuals.
The most common legal structures for businesses are:
— sole trader
—
— partnership
—
— company.
—
There are two types of company:
— private limited
—
— public listed.
—
A company is a separate legal entity to its owners/shareholders, who enjoy
the benefits of limited liability.
Social enterprises exist to pursue social and/or environmental goals.
Government business enterprises are government-owned (public sector)
enterprises that have adopted a corporate model.

All businesses must establish aims or objectives.
Objectives should be set using the SMART principle.
Business objectives can be to make a profit, to increase market share, to
improve efficiency, to improve effectiveness, to fulfil a market need, to fulfil
a social need and to meet shareholder expectations.
Vision and mission statements are important for all businesses.
A values statement allows a business to focus on what is important in the
business related to its shared values and cultural priorities.
Stakeholders have expectations regarding the performance of a business.
It is important for businesses to continually revisit objectives and look at
ways to improve their other objectives.

Key knowledge Summary
•
Management
styles, including
autocratic, persuasive,
consultative,
participative and
laissez-faire
•
•
•
•
Management style is the approach used to provide direction, implement
plans and motivate people.
There are a variety of management styles: autocratic, persuasive,
consultative, participative and laissez-faire.
The contingency or situational management approach applies a range of
variables that can be used to determine the appropriate style for a given set
of circumstances.
The variables are the nature of the task, the time frame, the level of experience
of the employees, any constraints (such as money or resources), the corporate
culture of the business and finally the preferred style of the manager.
•
The appropriateness
of management
styles in relation to
the nature of the task,
time, experience
of employees and
manager preference
•
The styles vary according to a range of characteristics. First, their degree of
centralisation relating to authority and decision-making. Second, the focus
or orientation they adopt, whether task achievement is of greater importance
than having satisfied employees or a combination of both. Third, their
belief in what acts to motivate employees: is it money or challenging and
interesting tasks? Fourth, the attitude of the manager to their subordinates:
do they believe they need to be directed in everything they do or do they
actually have trust and faith in their ability? Finally, the communication flow
differs between the styles, varying from closed (downward) to a totally open
flow in the participative style.
•
Management
skills, including
communication,
delegation, planning,
leading, decision-
making and
interpersonal
•
•
Management skills are the abilities or expertise required by a manager to
achieve their work.
A range of skills is required by managers regardless of their level in the
management hierarchy: communication, delegation, planning, leading,
decision-making and interpersonal.
•
The relationship
between management
styles and management
skills
•
The interrelationship that exists between management styles and skills
provides an opportunity for assessing whether management is effective.
•
Corporate culture, both
official and real
•
•
•
•
•
Corporate culture is an internal factor that management seeks to influence
with a view to optimisation of business performance.
Corporate culture refers to the shared values and beliefs of people within a
business.
Official corporate culture refers to the set of values and beliefs desired by
the management of a business.
Real/unofficial culture refers to the culture that actually prevails in a business.
The following factors are keys to developing the desired corporate culture
within a business organisation:
— mission, vision and values statements
—
— management structure
—
— management style
—
— policies and procedures
—
— business documentation and forms of communication used
—
— the people within the business
—
— the physical environment and material symbols within the business
—
— stories, narratives and rituals shared within the business.

Sample examination questions and advice
Unit 3 Area of Study 1: Business foundations
In this Area of Study, students are introduced to the key characteristics of businesses and their
stakeholders. They investigate potential conflicts between the different demands of stakeholders on a
business. Corporate culture and a range of management styles and skills that may be used when managing
a business are also examined and applied to contemporary business case studies from the past four years.
Outcome 1 requires students to be able to analyse the key characteristics of businesses, their
stakeholders, management styles and skills, and their corporate culture.
Question 1
Mick and Richard are partners in Leaf Inventions. They have decided that, rather than continuing to
operate in their current legal structure of a partnership, they will incorporate their business and form
a company. They are, however, uncertain whether to incorporate to become a private limited or public
listed company.
Discuss the implications for the business, Leaf Inventions, if its owners decide to become a private
company rather than being publicly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. (4 marks)

A possible answer to Question 1 might be:
Sample response
By adopting the legal structure of a company, regardless of whether private limited or public
listed, Mick and Richard will gain certain advantages. One important implication related to
adopting either form of company structure is that it provides Mick and Richard (as shareholders)
the protection of creating a separate legal entity and therefore limiting their liability for any
debts incurred by the business. It also provides them with perpetuity (ongoing life) for their
business. Establishing the business as a public listed company will, however, provide greater
opportunity for Leaf Inventions to raise capital through having the ability to have a larger
number of shareholders in the business, as it will be listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.
While both forms of company structure must ensure that they adhere to legal and compliance
requirements, these are less onerous and less costly for a private limited company.
Marking guide:
•
No marks for a response that only defines the characteristics of a company
•
2–3 marks for a response that states and discusses arguments covering both forms of
company structure
•
To gain full marks (4 marks), you will need to state and discuss arguments covering implications for
adopting both forms of company structure and include reference to the stimulus material (i.e. Mick
and Richard and Leaf Inventions).
Question 2
Mick and Richard, owners of Leaf Inventions, have decided to become a private limited company.

that may arise due to the changed legal structure of the business. (4 marks)

•
Identify relevant stakeholders to the business.
Choose two stakeholders and describe their interest. (Remember, there are many stakeholders for
a business – owners, managers, employees, customers, suppliers and the general community.)
Determine any potential areas of conflict.
A possible answer to Question 2 might be:
Sample response
Two stakeholders, being either an individual or a group, who have a vested interest in the
activities of Leaf Inventions are firstly its shareholders, who would be looking for the business to
be profitable and to provide dividends to them based on their shareholding. An area of conflict
could arise when Mick and Richard, who are now shareholders, want to retain funds within the
business to assist with its future growth, whereas the other shareholders (owners) would like to
receive a large dividend yield on their investment.
A second stakeholder to the business is the government, which wants to ensure that
the company is correctly registered, is paying the correct forms of taxation, is making
superannuation contributions on behalf of its staff and is compliant with any specific regulations
relating to operating a company. Conflict may arise between the company and the government
if any of the above requirements are not adequately met or are breached.
Marking guide:
•
1 mark for identifying two relevant stakeholders
•
2 marks for description of two relevant stakeholders and nature of interest
•
3–4 marks for description of two relevant stakeholders, nature of interest and possible areas of
conflict.
Question 3
Mick is chief finance officer and Richard is operations manager of Leaf Inventions Pty Ltd. It is the
aim of the business to enter a period of growth, and to achieve this they have each agreed the most
appropriate management style for them to adopt is consultative.

Hints:
•
•
This question has multiple parts (management styles and skills) and requires all parts to be
completed to gain full marks.
There are a range of other skills that could be identified and justified, including delegation,
leadership, decision-making and interpersonal.
A possible answer to Question 3a might be:
Sample response
The consultative management style is characterised by the manager exercising centralised
control and authority while taking account of the ideas and concepts provided by employees,
particularly in relation to making decisions. The manager considers task achievement to be an
important factor, but also understands the importance of the ‘people factor’, which results in
employees becoming more motivated and wanting to perform to their best.
Two management skills that would be important are communication and planning.
Communication that is open and encourages discussion and feedback would be essential.
It would be in the form of top-down information and directions by management (Mick
and Richard) to employees (subordinates) related to their growth plans. Upward flow of
communication from the employees to management would then be able to provide valuable
options and feedback relating to expansion plans.
Planning is a skill that relates to future-oriented decision-making. It involves understanding
the purpose or aims of the business, then formulating various levels of objectives, plans and
strategies to meet the desired outcome. This skill is therefore important if Mick and Richard wish
to embark on a growth strategy for their business.
Marking guide:
•
2 marks for describing the key characteristics of the consultative style
•
3 marks for identifying and justifying two management skills that relate to growing the business.

A possible answer to Question 3b might be:
Sample response
Corporate culture relates to the shared values and beliefs held within a business. By adopting
a consultative management style, Mick and Richard are demonstrating that they want to set
the approach the business will be taking, as they wish to remain in control of its operations,
its communication flow and therefore its official culture. However, by adopting this style they
demonstrate that they value their employees and wish them to be motivated and contribute to
the success of the business.

To gain full marks, students need to establish the impact of characteristics of the style on the
corporate culture of the business.

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
