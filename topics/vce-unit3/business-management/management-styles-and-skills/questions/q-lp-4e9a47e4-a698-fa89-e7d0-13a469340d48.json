There is political instability, cultural differences with local partners, multiple entry strategies available, and the potential for significant financial loss. Evaluate which combination of complexity factors makes this decision particularly challenging.",
      "correct": "All five factors are present: uncertainty, interrelated factors, high-risk consequences, interpersonal issues, and numerous alternatives",
      "correctExplanation": "Political instability creates uncertainty; business elements are interrelated; financial loss represents high-risk consequences; cultural differences create interpersonal issues; and multiple entry strategies provide numerous alternatives.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Only uncertainty and high-risk consequences are present because political instability is the dominant factor", "explanation": "Political instability contributes to uncertainty, but cultural tensions, interconnected elements, and multiple strategies also add complexity." },

Both approaches carry legal, financial, and reputational risks. Evaluate how the interplay of complexity factors shapes this disagreement.",
      "correct": "Interpersonal conflict between managers is amplified by uncertainty about outcomes and high-risk consequences of either approach",
      "correctExplanation": "The managers' disagreement is an interpersonal issue, but it is intensified because both options carry unpredictable and potentially severe outcomes, making resolution harder.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The disagreement is solely interpersonal and can be resolved by simply choosing the senior manager's preference", "explanation": "The disagreement is complicated by genuine uncertainty and high-risk consequences; seniority alone cannot resolve the underlying complexity." },

Staff are emotionally attached to programs, community groups will be affected, and each program is linked to different funding streams. Assess why this decision is more complex than a similar cost-cutting decision in a for-profit business.",
      "correct": "Stronger interpersonal and community attachments combine with interrelated funding structures to intensify every complexity factor",
      "correctExplanation": "In not-for-profits, emotional investment from staff and communities heightens interpersonal issues, and interconnected funding streams mean cutting one program may jeopardise others.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Not-for-profit decisions are actually simpler because they do not need to consider shareholder returns or profit margins", "explanation": "The absence of profit motives does not simplify the decision; community obligations and emotional attachments often increase complexity." },

Public opinion is divided, scientific evidence is inconclusive, the policy affects multiple interconnected departments, and reversal would be politically costly.

      "distractors": [

      "correct": "Multiple complexity factors operating simultaneously require a structured approach to ensure each factor is properly evaluated",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "A systematic process is unnecessary because experienced CEOs can rely on business instinct for major restructuring decisions", "explanation": "Instinct alone is insufficient when multiple complexity factors interact; a systematic process reduces the risk of overlooking critical connections." },

Residents oppose it due to traffic concerns, developers argue it will create jobs, environmental groups cite habitat destruction, and the council's budget depends on development levies.

      "correct": "Each stakeholder's concern is connected to others, so addressing one group's issue may worsen problems for another group",
      "correctExplanation": "Reducing traffic may require design changes that decrease developer profits and levy income; protecting habitat may limit housing and job creation. The interconnections create unavoidable trade-offs.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The factors are not truly interrelated because each stakeholder group has a completely separate and independent concern", "explanation": "The concerns are deeply connected; traffic, jobs, environment, and finances all influence each other in this development decision." },
