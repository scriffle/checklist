      "correct": "They develop alternatives such as building a full cafe, not adding a cafe at all, or trying a smaller trial version to test demand before committing to a full build",
      "correctExplanation": "Step three creates multiple options ranging from full commitment to no action, with intermediate options that reduce risk; this ensures the decision considers different approaches.",

      "question": "Why is it important to develop more than one alternative solution before making a decision?",
      "correct": "Multiple alternatives provide genuine choice and allow comparison, increasing the likelihood of finding the best solution rather than defaulting to the first option considered",
      "correctExplanation": "Creating multiple options enables comparison and may reveal solutions that would not have been considered if the manager stopped at the first idea.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Only one alternative is ever needed because the first solution a manager thinks of is always the best possible option", "explanation": "First solutions may not be optimal; developing alternatives allows comparison and often reveals better approaches." },
