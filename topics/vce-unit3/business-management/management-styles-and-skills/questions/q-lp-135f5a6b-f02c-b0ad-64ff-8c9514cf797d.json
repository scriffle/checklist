      "question": "A consulting firm manager uses a consultative style with her senior analysts but shifts to autocratic when working with interns during busy periods. Evaluate whether this inconsistency is justified based on the contingency approach.",
      "correct": "The inconsistency is justified because the senior analysts' experience and the interns' inexperience combined with time pressure represent different contingency variables",
      "correctExplanation": "The contingency approach supports adapting style based on employee experience and time constraints; experienced analysts benefit from consultation while interns in busy periods need direction.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The inconsistency is never justified because a manager should use the same style with all employees to be fair", "explanation": "Fairness does not require identical treatment; the contingency approach recognises that different situations require different styles." },

      "correct": "The decision is legitimate because the consultative style requires considering input, not necessarily following majority opinion",
      "correctExplanation": "In a consultative style, the decision-maker weighs all factors including employee input, strategic priorities, and information employees may not have access to; the final decision may legitimately differ from staff preferences.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The decision is illegitimate because a consultative approach requires the manager to follow the majority view", "explanation": "The consultative style does not require following majority opinion; it requires consideration of input, which may lead to a different conclusion." },

      "correct": "The claim is incorrect because the consultative style uniquely combines employee engagement with clear managerial accountability that participative management may dilute",
      "correctExplanation": "The consultative style has a distinct advantage: it motivates employees through involvement while maintaining clear accountability, which can be blurred when decisions are genuinely shared in a participative approach.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because there is no meaningful difference between consultative and participative management styles", "explanation": "There is a significant difference in decision-making authority; consultative retains it with the manager while participative shares it." },

After six months, employee satisfaction has increased but decision-making speed has decreased. The department head is considering reverting to autocratic. Evaluate the trade-offs involved in this decision.",
      "correct": "The trade-off between employee satisfaction and decision speed is inherent to the consultative style; the department head should consider whether the engagement benefits outweigh the time costs rather than reverting entirely",
      "correctExplanation": "The slower decision-making is a predictable consequence of consultation; reverting would sacrifice the satisfaction gains and should only occur if speed is genuinely more critical than engagement.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The department should immediately revert to autocratic because speed is always more important than employee satisfaction", "explanation": "Speed is not always the priority; in many contexts, employee satisfaction drives better long-term outcomes through higher engagement and lower turnover." },
        { "answer": "The decrease in speed proves the consultative style is fundamentally flawed and should never be used in government departments", "explanation": "Slower decision-making is an expected trade-off, not a fundamental flaw; it must be weighed against the benefits of increased satisfaction." },

      "correctExplanation": "Scale creates challenges because a manager cannot personally consult thousands of employees; representative structures may reduce the personal engagement that drives the style's benefits.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The consultative style works identically regardless of business size because the principles are the same", "explanation": "While principles are consistent, the practical implementation changes dramatically with scale, creating different challenges." },

      "correct": "This is not genuine consultation but rather a superficial imitation; true consultative management requires sincere consideration of input, not just the appearance of asking",
      "correctExplanation": "If decisions are predetermined, the consultation is performative rather than genuine, which undermines trust and may cause more damage than honest autocratic management.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This is still valid consultative management because the manager technically asked for input regardless of whether it was used", "explanation": "Genuine consultation requires sincere consideration of input; asking without considering is performative and erodes employee trust." },

      "correct": "The manager should communicate transparently about why the style shift is necessary during crises and return to consultative practices as soon as conditions allow",
      "correctExplanation": "Transparent communication about the temporary need for directive management during crises preserves trust, and promptly returning to consultation after the crisis demonstrates respect for employee involvement.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The manager should always use the same style regardless of circumstances to avoid confusing employees", "explanation": "Rigid adherence to one style ignores the contingency approach; transparent communication about style shifts is more effective." },

      "correct": "The midpoint position is a strength because it provides flexibility to incorporate elements of both directive and collaborative approaches depending on the situation",
      "correctExplanation": "Being at the midpoint means the consultative style can lean more directive or more collaborative as needed, offering versatility that extreme styles cannot match.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The midpoint position is a limitation because it means the style is neither fully directive nor fully collaborative, making it ineffective", "explanation": "The midpoint is not about being ineffective; it represents a practical balance that suits many business situations." },
