        { "answer": "Monitor progress", "explanation": "Monitoring progress occurs after the task has been delegated and work has begun, not at the start of the process." },

      "question": "Which of the following is a reason why some managers struggle to delegate?",
      "correct": "Fear of losing control",
      "correctExplanation": "Some managers are reluctant to delegate because they fear losing control over the task's outcome and the way work is completed.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Having too many employees", "explanation": "Having many employees creates more opportunity to delegate, not less; the barriers are psychological, not numerical." },
        { "answer": "Receiving excessive praise from senior management", "explanation": "Praise is not a barrier to delegation; managers struggle due to insecurity, lack of trust, or fear of losing control." },
        { "answer": "Employees requesting more delegation", "explanation": "Employee requests for delegation would encourage it; the barriers come from the manager's own concerns about control and trust." }

      "type": "mc",
      "question": "What does delegation involve?",
      "correct": "Passing formal authority down the hierarchy to employees",
      "correctExplanation": "Delegation means transferring the authority and responsibility for specific tasks from a manager to employees at lower levels of the hierarchy.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Removing all employees from the business permanently", "explanation": "Delegation transfers authority for tasks, not the removal of employees; it empowers staff with responsibility." },
        { "answer": "Promoting an employee to a higher management role", "explanation": "Delegation is about assigning specific task authority, not about permanent promotions to higher positions." },
        { "answer": "A manager completing all work personally without any help", "explanation": "This is the opposite of delegation; delegation involves assigning tasks and authority to others." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Review the outcome", "explanation": "Reviewing the outcome is the final step; the employee must first be briefed, then monitored, before the outcome can be reviewed." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "All tasks in the entire shop", "explanation": "The owner has delegated the operational tasks listed; they retain responsibility for ordering and supplier relationships specifically." },

      "correctExplanation": "Without a thorough briefing, employees may not know what is expected, leading to poor outcomes that could have been prevented with clear instructions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Briefing is not important because competent employees should be able to figure out any task without any instructions or guidance", "explanation": "Even competent employees need clarity on expectations and parameters; briefing prevents misunderstandings and ensures aligned outcomes." },

      "correct": "Autocratic managers delegate minimally because they prefer centralised control, while participative and laissez-faire managers delegate extensively because they empower employees",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "All five management styles use exactly the same amount of delegation because the skill is applied identically regardless of style", "explanation": "Delegation levels vary significantly across styles; autocratic managers delegate far less than participative or laissez-faire managers." },
        { "answer": "Autocratic managers delegate the most because they want employees to do all the work while the manager simply gives orders", "explanation": "Autocratic managers retain control and delegate minimally; giving orders is directing, not delegating authority." },

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Explain why monitoring progress is a necessary step in the delegation process rather than simply waiting for the final result.",
      "correct": "Monitoring allows the manager to identify and address problems early, provide support if needed, and ensure the task stays on track before it is too late to make corrections",
      "correctExplanation": "Early intervention through monitoring prevents small issues from becoming major problems and demonstrates the manager's ongoing responsibility for delegated tasks.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Monitoring is unnecessary because delegated tasks always proceed perfectly without any need for managerial attention or support", "explanation": "Tasks can encounter unexpected problems; monitoring allows timely support and correction before issues become serious." },

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "How does a lack of trust in employees create a barrier to effective delegation?",
      "correct": "Managers who do not trust employees to complete tasks competently are reluctant to transfer authority, preferring to do tasks themselves to ensure the desired outcome",
      "correctExplanation": "Trust is essential for delegation; without it, managers overburden themselves with tasks that could be shared, limiting both their effectiveness and employee development.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Lack of trust has no effect on delegation because managers delegate based purely on business need regardless of how they feel about employees", "explanation": "Psychological barriers like trust significantly affect delegation behaviour; managers often resist delegating to people they do not trust." },
        { "answer": "Lack of trust actually increases delegation because distrustful managers want employees to fail so they can justify terminating them", "explanation": "Distrustful managers typically retain tasks rather than risking poor outcomes; they withhold delegation rather than setting employees up to fail." },
        { "answer": "Trust is irrelevant because all employees are equally capable of completing any task without training or experience", "explanation": "Employees have varying skills and experience; trust in their specific capabilities is a legitimate factor in delegation decisions." }

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Describe how delegation can benefit both the manager and the employee receiving the delegated task.",
      "correct": "Managers gain time for higher-level tasks and strategic thinking, while employees gain new skills, experience, and motivation through increased responsibility",
      "correctExplanation": "Delegation creates mutual benefit: managers can focus on what only they can do, while employees develop professionally through new challenges and authority.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Delegation only benefits the manager because employees receive extra work without any personal gain or development opportunity", "explanation": "Employees benefit through skill development, increased responsibility, and career growth; delegation is not simply adding work without benefit." },
        { "answer": "Delegation only benefits the employee because the manager loses control and authority by passing tasks down the hierarchy", "explanation": "Managers benefit by freeing time for strategic tasks; they retain accountability while gaining capacity for higher-level responsibilities." },
        { "answer": "Neither party benefits because delegation simply moves the same amount of work around without changing the total workload or outcomes", "explanation": "Delegation improves efficiency by matching tasks to appropriate skill levels and frees management time for higher-value activities." }

      "question": "Why is choosing the right person an important step in the delegation process?",
      "correct": "Selecting someone with the appropriate skills, experience, and availability ensures the task is completed effectively and the employee is not set up to fail",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Choosing the right person is not important because any employee can complete any task regardless of skills or experience", "explanation": "Employees have different strengths and capabilities; delegating a task to someone without the necessary skills leads to poor outcomes." },
        { "answer": "The manager should always delegate to the newest employee because they have the most free time and fewest responsibilities", "explanation": "Task complexity should match employee capability; new employees may lack the skills needed for challenging delegated tasks." },
        { "answer": "Random selection is the fairest approach to delegation because choosing specific people shows favouritism in the workplace", "explanation": "Delegation should match skills to tasks; selecting the most capable person is practical management, not favouritism." }
