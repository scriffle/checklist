The CEO must communicate with employees, local government regulators, media, and international partners. Evaluate which approach would be most effective for managing these diverse communication needs.",
      "correct": "Use personal communication for affected employees, external operational communication for regulators and partners, and a coordinated media strategy for public messaging",
      "correctExplanation": "Different audiences require different forms: employees need personal interaction for sensitive news, regulators and partners need formal external communication, and media requires a separate coordinated approach.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Use a single company-wide email to all parties to ensure everyone receives the same consistent message simultaneously", "explanation": "Different stakeholders have different needs and relationships with the business; a single email cannot address the varied communication requirements." },

      "correct": "Using impersonal mass communication with affected customers could damage trust, while informal internal communication could lead to inconsistent safety responses",
      "correctExplanation": "Customers need direct, personal communication to feel valued during a safety issue, while staff need clear internal organisational communication to ensure consistent and safe responses.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The form of communication does not matter during a crisis because speed is the only important factor in these situations", "explanation": "While speed matters, using inappropriate communication forms can damage trust with customers and create confusion among staff." },

      "correct": "Personal communication alone cannot reliably reach fifty people, and systematic internal channels ensure consistent information sharing across the growing organisation",
      "correctExplanation": "As organisations grow, personal communication becomes insufficient for reaching everyone; internal organisational systems provide scalable, consistent information distribution.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Personal communication is no longer appropriate once a business exceeds ten employees regardless of the situation", "explanation": "There is no fixed threshold; personal communication remains valuable but must be supplemented with organisational systems as the team grows." },

      "correct": "Business A's personalised approach is more effective because it demonstrates respect for customers and provides a rationale, strengthening the external relationship",
      "correctExplanation": "Personalised external communication shows customers they are valued and helps them understand the reasons, while a website notice feels impersonal and may drive customers to competitors.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both approaches are equally effective because customers only care about the price, not how the increase is communicated",  "explanation": "How a message is communicated significantly affects customer perception; personalised communication builds trust that a brief notice cannot." },
        { "answer": "Business B's approach is more effective because it reaches all customers instantly through the website without any cost", "explanation": "While more efficient, the impersonal nature may damage customer relationships; effectiveness is about maintaining trust, not just reach." },

      "correct": "Each audience has different information needs, relationships with the school, and emotional responses that require tailored communication forms",
      "correctExplanation": "Teachers need detailed internal briefings, parents and students need accessible external explanations, and the education department needs formal compliance communication.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "A single unified message is actually more effective because it prevents any inconsistency between what different groups are told", "explanation": "While consistency matters, different audiences need different levels of detail, tone, and communication forms to understand and accept the policy." },
        { "answer": "Only teachers need to be communicated with because they are responsible for passing all information to parents and students", "explanation": "Relying solely on teachers to cascade information risks miscommunication; direct communication with each audience ensures clarity." },

      "correct": "The claim is flawed because digital tools enhance organisational communication but cannot replicate the trust-building and emotional intelligence of personal interaction",
      "correctExplanation": "While technology improves information sharing, sensitive conversations, relationship building, and conflict resolution still require personal communication that no system can fully replace.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because modern communication platforms like video calls and messaging apps have fully replaced face-to-face interaction", "explanation": "Digital platforms are tools, not replacements; they lack the full emotional and relational depth of in-person personal communication." },
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because efficiency should always be prioritised over personal relationships in modern business management", "explanation": "Effective management requires balancing efficiency with relationship quality; prioritising one over the other leads to communication failures." },
        { "answer": "The claim cannot be evaluated because the three forms of communication were defined before digital technology existed and are now outdated", "explanation": "The three forms remain relevant regardless of technology; digital tools are channels that serve these forms rather than replacing them." }

      "correctExplanation": "Remote work limits body language reading, eliminates casual corridor conversations that build relationships, and reduces the emotional impact of physical presence during important discussions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Remote work has no impact on personal communication because video calls provide an identical experience to face-to-face meetings", "explanation": "Video calls lack the full range of non-verbal cues, spontaneous interactions, and physical presence that characterise in-person personal communication." },
