      "correct": "The persuasive style adds explanation and reasoning to gain employee understanding",

      "correct": "When employees understand the reasoning behind a decision they are more likely to comply willingly because they see the purpose, rather than complying only because they were told to",

      "correct": "Explaining the reasoning helps employees accept the change by understanding its necessity, reducing resistance and resentment compared to unexplained directives",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Persuasive management allows employees to reject changes they disagree with after hearing the explanation", "explanation": "Persuasive management does not offer rejection; it explains the decision to gain acceptance, but the decision stands regardless." },

      "type": "mc",

      "correct": "Autocratic communication is purely directive, telling employees what to do, while persuasive communication adds explanation and reasoning to build understanding alongside the directive",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Autocratic managers do not communicate at all while persuasive managers use extensive two-way dialogue", "explanation": "Autocratic managers do communicate through directives; persuasive managers add explanation but still use one-way communication, not two-way dialogue." },

      "correct": "Both prioritise achieving business objectives through centralised control and managerial direction, focusing on task completion rather than on empowering employees or building collaborative relationships",
      "correctExplanation": "Task orientation means the primary focus is on getting work done efficiently through managerial authority, which defines both autocratic and persuasive approaches.",

        { "answer": "They are called task-oriented because they only apply to manual labour tasks and cannot be used for knowledge work", "explanation": "Task-oriented refers to management focus, not the type of work; both styles can be applied to any type of work including knowledge work." }

      "correctExplanation": "The persuasive style sits one step from autocratic on the continuum because it adds communication that values employees' need for understanding, even without sharing authority.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The persuasive style does not represent any greater engagement because explaining decisions is meaningless unless employees can change the outcome", "explanation": "Understanding reasoning is valuable even without input into decisions; it improves acceptance, trust, and compliance quality." },
