      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The manager makes all decisions alone and instructs employees on what to do", "explanation": "This describes the autocratic management style, not participative, which involves employee input in decisions." },

      "correct": "The manager provides minimal direction and empowers employees to set their own objectives",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The manager closely supervises all tasks and makes every decision centrally", "explanation": "Close supervision and centralised decisions describe autocratic management, the opposite of laissez-faire." },

      "correct": "Employees are empowered to make their own decisions within agreed boundaries",
      "correctExplanation": "Laissez-faire management allows skilled employees to direct their own work, with the manager setting broad parameters like budget and deadlines rather than specific instructions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The manager has abandoned all responsibility for the team's output and results", "explanation": "The manager still sets constraints like budget and deadlines; laissez-faire is empowerment within boundaries, not abandonment." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The sign-off is just a formality with no practical importance because the team's collective decision is always the final decision", "explanation": "The sign-off is meaningful because it represents the manager's accountability for the outcome; it is not merely symbolic." },
        { "answer": "The sign-off proves that participative management is actually autocratic because the manager has the final say regardless of input", "explanation": "Retaining final accountability is different from ignoring input; participative managers genuinely incorporate employee contributions into decisions." },
