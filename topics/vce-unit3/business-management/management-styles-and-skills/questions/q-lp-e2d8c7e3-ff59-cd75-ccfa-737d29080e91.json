However, the tactical plans from different departments are contradictory: marketing wants to enter Asia first while operations wants to start in Europe. Evaluate how this conflict should be resolved using the planning hierarchy.",
      "correct": "Senior management should clarify the strategic plan with specific regional priorities, then departments can align their tactical plans to the revised strategic direction",
      "correctExplanation": "The strategic plan lacks sufficient specificity; resolving departmental conflict requires senior management to provide clearer strategic guidance that eliminates competing interpretations.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Let each department implement their own preferred regional strategy simultaneously because competition between departments drives better results", "explanation": "Contradictory departmental strategies waste resources and create confusion; aligned tactical plans are essential for effective execution." },

      "correct": "The three levels remain valuable as a framework, but modern businesses may need shorter cycles and more frequent revision at all levels to maintain agility while preserving strategic direction",
      "correctExplanation": "The hierarchy provides essential structure for aligning effort, but rigid multi-year plans may need more frequent review cycles to respond to rapid market changes.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The three-level hierarchy is completely outdated and should be abandoned entirely in favour of purely reactive management", "explanation": "Purely reactive management lacks direction; the hierarchy provides essential structure that can be adapted for agility without being abandoned." },
        { "answer": "Modern businesses should only use operational planning because long-term plans are always wrong in rapidly changing markets", "explanation": "Even in fast markets, strategic direction is essential; the key is reviewing and adapting plans more frequently, not abandoning long-term thinking." },

      "correct": "The informal approach works while the owner manages alone, but creates succession risk and scalability problems; formalising planning levels would support growth and knowledge transfer",
      "correctExplanation": "Single-person planning is efficient in a small business but becomes a bottleneck as the business grows and creates risk if the owner becomes unavailable.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "All businesses regardless of size must use formal three-level planning or they will inevitably fail", "explanation": "Very small businesses can operate effectively with informal planning; the need for formalisation increases with business size and complexity." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Government departments and tech startups use completely different planning frameworks with no commonality between them", "explanation": "Both use the same three-level structure; the difference is in timeframes and flexibility, not in the fundamental framework." },

      "correctExplanation": "Operational planning is where strategy becomes reality; poor daily execution undermines even the best strategic and tactical plans.",
      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [
