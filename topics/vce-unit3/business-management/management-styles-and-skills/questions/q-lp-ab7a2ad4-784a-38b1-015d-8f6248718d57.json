      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The continuum perfectly captures all aspects of management behaviour because every manager fits neatly into exactly one of the five styles", "explanation": "Real management is more nuanced; managers often blend styles or shift between them, which the continuum simplifies." },

      "distractors": [
