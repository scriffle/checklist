      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The time disadvantage cannot be managed at all because any form of consultation will always take excessive amounts of time", "explanation": "Structured consultation can be efficient; time limits, focused discussions, and selective stakeholder engagement reduce the time cost." },

      "correct": "Volunteers are not financially obligated to stay; if demotivated by autocratic management they can simply leave, causing critical labour shortages that paid workplaces can offset with compensation",
      "correctExplanation": "Without financial incentive to endure demotivating management, volunteers exercise their freedom to leave, making the motivational disadvantage of autocratic management especially costly for not-for-profits.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The autocratic disadvantage is identical for volunteers and paid workers because motivation is not related to whether someone receives payment", "explanation": "While motivation matters for both, paid workers have a financial reason to stay; volunteers who are demotivated face no financial penalty for leaving." },
        { "answer": "Volunteers should be managed autocratically because they need strict direction to compensate for their lack of professional training", "explanation": "While some guidance is appropriate, autocratic management risks losing volunteers who contribute freely and can easily withdraw their labour." },
