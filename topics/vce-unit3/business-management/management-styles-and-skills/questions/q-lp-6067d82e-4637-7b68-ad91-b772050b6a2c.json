      "correct": "The nature of the task",
      "correctExplanation": "The nature of the task is one of five key variables; routine or urgent tasks may suit different styles than complex creative tasks.",
      "distractors": [

      "question": "How does employee knowledge and experience influence a manager's choice of style?",
      "correct": "Highly experienced employees may suit a participative or laissez-faire style, while inexperienced employees may need an autocratic approach",
      "correctExplanation": "Employee capability determines how much direction is needed; experienced workers thrive with autonomy while new workers need more structured guidance.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Employee experience has no effect because all employees should be managed the same way regardless of their skill level", "explanation": "Employee experience is a key variable; different skill levels require different amounts of direction and autonomy." },
        { "answer": "Only inexperienced employees need management; experienced employees should never be managed using any style at all", "explanation": "All employees benefit from management; the variable affects which style is most appropriate, not whether management is needed." },
        { "answer": "Experienced employees always prefer autocratic management because they want to be told exactly what to do", "explanation": "Experienced employees typically prefer more autonomy; autocratic management can be demotivating for skilled workers who can self-direct." }

      "correct": "A business with a collaborative culture supports participative or consultative styles, while a hierarchical culture supports autocratic or persuasive styles; managers must align their approach with the organisation's values",
      "correctExplanation": "Corporate culture creates expectations about how decisions are made; a manager using a style that conflicts with the culture will face resistance from both employees and other managers.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Corporate culture has no influence because managers should always override organisational norms with their own preferred approach", "explanation": "Ignoring corporate culture creates conflict and resistance; effective managers work within the culture or change it gradually." },

      "question": "Describe how the nature of the task affects management style choice, using the contrast between a routine production task and a creative design project.",
      "correct": "Routine production tasks benefit from autocratic direction for consistency and efficiency, while creative design projects benefit from participative or laissez-faire styles that allow innovation and employee autonomy",
      "correctExplanation": "The task's requirements determine which style's advantages are most relevant; structured tasks need structured management, while creative tasks need freedom.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "All tasks require identical management regardless of whether they are routine or creative because work is work", "explanation": "Different tasks have fundamentally different requirements; routine tasks need consistency while creative tasks need freedom." },
        { "answer": "Creative tasks should always use autocratic management because creativity needs strict control to produce usable results", "explanation": "Research consistently shows that creativity thrives with autonomy; autocratic control typically suppresses creative output." },
        { "answer": "The nature of the task is irrelevant because management style should only be based on the manager's personal preference", "explanation": "Task nature is a key variable; effective managers adapt their style to match the requirements of different tasks." }

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Explain why constraints such as time and money might force a manager to adopt an autocratic style even if they prefer a participative approach.",
      "correct": "Tight deadlines and limited budgets require fast, decisive action that participative processes cannot deliver quickly enough; the constraints override personal preference to meet practical demands",
      "correctExplanation": "Constraints create practical limitations on which styles are feasible; when time or money is scarce, the speed of autocratic decision-making may be necessary.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Constraints never affect style choice because managers should always use their preferred style regardless of time or budget limitations", "explanation": "Practical constraints directly affect which styles are feasible; ignoring them can lead to missed deadlines and wasted resources." },
        { "answer": "Participative management is actually faster than autocratic management when time is limited because more people can work on the problem simultaneously", "explanation": "While parallel work is possible, the participative decision-making process itself takes longer; autocratic decisions are faster when time is critical." },
        { "answer": "Money constraints have no relationship to management style because all styles cost exactly the same amount to implement", "explanation": "Different styles have different resource implications; consultative and participative processes require time investment that has real cost implications." }

    },
    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "How does a manager's personality influence their choice of management style?",
      "correct": "Managers who are naturally controlling may gravitate toward autocratic styles, while those who value collaboration may prefer participative approaches; personality shapes comfort levels with different degrees of employee involvement",
      "correctExplanation": "Personal disposition affects which styles feel natural and can be executed authentically; however, effective managers learn to adapt beyond their natural preferences.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Manager personality has no effect because all managers are trained to use identical approaches regardless of their personal characteristics", "explanation": "Training provides skills but personality influences which styles managers implement most effectively and naturally." },
        { "answer": "Only extroverted managers can use participative management because introverts are incapable of any form of collaboration", "explanation": "Introverted managers can be effective collaborative leaders; personality influences preference but does not determine capability." },
        { "answer": "Manager personality is the only variable that matters because all other factors are irrelevant compared to who the manager is as a person", "explanation": "While personality matters, the other four variables (employee experience, task nature, constraints, and culture) are equally important." }

    },
    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Explain why the contingency approach recommends using different styles for different situations rather than one consistent style.",
      "correct": "Different situations have different combinations of the five variables, meaning the optimal style changes as circumstances change; a single style cannot address all possible combinations effectively",
      "correctExplanation": "The contingency approach recognises that the five variables create unique contexts that require tailored management responses for maximum effectiveness.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The contingency approach is wrong because consistency is always more important than adapting to circumstances in management", "explanation": "While consistency has value, rigid adherence to one style regardless of context reduces management effectiveness across varied situations." },
        { "answer": "Different styles are recommended only because textbooks need to cover all five styles, not because situational adaptation actually improves management outcomes", "explanation": "Research supports the contingency approach; matching style to situation genuinely improves management effectiveness and business outcomes." },
        { "answer": "All situations are identical so the contingency approach is unnecessary and any style works equally well everywhere", "explanation": "Situations vary significantly across the five variables; what works for experienced creative teams fails for new production workers." }

      "question": "A team of highly skilled engineers working on a complex innovation project would benefit from which management style? Explain why using the relevant variables.",
      "correct": "Participative or laissez-faire, because the employees' high skill level means they can contribute meaningfully to decisions or work independently, and the complex creative nature of the task benefits from employee autonomy",
      "correctExplanation": "Two variables align toward people-oriented styles: the employees' experience and skill justify greater autonomy, and the creative task nature benefits from the innovation that autonomy enables.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Autocratic, because all engineers need close supervision regardless of their experience level to ensure technical quality standards are met", "explanation": "Highly skilled engineers typically produce better outcomes with autonomy; close supervision can stifle the innovation that complex projects require." },
        { "answer": "The management style does not matter because engineering projects succeed or fail based on technical ability alone, not management approach", "explanation": "Management style significantly affects team collaboration, innovation, and motivation; even technically capable teams perform differently under different styles." },
        { "answer": "No management style should be used because engineers are professionals who should never be managed by anyone", "explanation": "All professionals benefit from appropriate management; the question is which style best supports their capabilities and the project requirements." }
