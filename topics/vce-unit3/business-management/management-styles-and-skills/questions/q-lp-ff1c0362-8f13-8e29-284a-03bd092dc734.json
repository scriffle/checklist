      "correct": "Leading is the highest priority because the principal needs to inspire a new vision, model the desired culture, and motivate staff to believe improvement is possible before specific changes can be effectively implemented",
      "correctExplanation": "When both results and morale are low, leadership that restores confidence and direction must come first; without staff belief in the vision, other skills like planning and communication will have limited impact.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Planning is the highest priority because creating a detailed academic improvement plan will automatically fix both low results and poor morale simultaneously", "explanation": "Plans without inspired staff are unlikely to be implemented effectively; leading must establish the foundation of motivation and vision first." },
        { "answer": "Delegation is the highest priority because the principal should immediately delegate academic improvement to teachers and focus on other administrative tasks", "explanation": "Delegating improvement to demoralised staff without first providing leadership and vision would likely fail due to low engagement." },

      "correct": "It can be valid if each justification is genuinely tailored to the specific scenario, but risks appearing formulaic if the justifications are generic; strong students vary their selections and always provide scenario-specific reasoning",
      "correctExplanation": "The quality lies in the justification, not just the selection; even commonly chosen skills can earn high marks if the reasoning demonstrates deep understanding of each unique scenario.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Using the same skills every time is always the best approach because it demonstrates consistency and ensures the student never chooses incorrectly", "explanation": "Consistent selection may indicate narrow thinking; different scenarios genuinely require different skills, and examiners reward analytical flexibility." },

      "correct": "The skill of matching management approaches to specific situations is directly relevant to real-world management, though exam scenarios are simplified; the analytical thinking required transfers to practice even if real situations are more complex",

      "correctExplanation": "Examiners value both selection and justification; a well-reasoned argument for an unusual choice may earn partial marks, but clearly inappropriate selections limit the response's potential.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The quality of justification is irrelevant because only the skill selection matters and either the correct skill is named or the response receives zero marks", "explanation": "Both selection and justification contribute to marks; a well-justified unusual choice often earns more than a correct selection with poor justification." },
