      "distractors": [

      "correct": "Participative management encourages employee input and shared decision-making, which makes staff comfortable suggesting new ideas and taking creative risks without fear of criticism",

      "distractors": [

      "correctExplanation": "Understanding the 'why' behind decisions increases buy-in and motivation; autocratic management issues directives without explanation, which can frustrate employees.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Persuasive and autocratic styles produce identical motivation levels because both centralise decisions and employees see no difference between the two styles", "explanation": "Employees do notice the difference; being given reasons creates greater understanding and willingness to comply compared to receiving orders without explanation." },
        { "answer": "Persuasive management always decreases motivation because employees resent being talked into compliance rather than genuinely involved in decisions", "explanation": "While not as empowering as participative styles, persuasive management generally improves motivation over autocratic by providing rationale and showing respect." },
        { "answer": "Autocratic management produces higher motivation because employees prefer being told exactly what to do without any reasons or justification", "explanation": "Most employees are more motivated when they understand the reasoning; autocratic approaches often reduce motivation through lack of explanation." }

      "correct": "Laissez-faire management creates a culture of autonomy and self-direction where experienced employees are trusted to manage their own work and make independent decisions",
      "correctExplanation": "By providing minimal direction, laissez-faire managers signal trust in employee capability, which creates a culture valuing independence and self-management.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Laissez-faire management creates a highly structured culture with strict procedures because the absence of direction forces employees to create their own rules", "explanation": "Laissez-faire typically produces an informal, autonomous culture; rigid self-imposed structure is unlikely when management provides minimal guidance." },
        { "answer": "Laissez-faire management cannot create any form of corporate culture because the manager is not actively shaping values or expectations through leadership", "explanation": "The absence of active direction itself shapes culture by establishing norms of independence and self-management." },

      "correct": "The culture would gradually shift from compliance and hierarchy toward greater openness and employee input, though resistance may occur from staff accustomed to receiving clear directives",
      "correctExplanation": "Changing management style reshapes daily interactions, communication patterns and expectations, which gradually transforms the corporate culture.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The culture would change instantly and completely the moment the new management style is announced because culture responds immediately to leadership changes", "explanation": "Cultural change is gradual; even when management style changes, established norms and habits take time to shift." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Financial results are the only valid measure because all other indicators are subjective and therefore completely meaningless for business assessment purposes", "explanation": "Non-financial indicators like turnover and engagement are measurable and strongly predictive of future financial performance." },
        { "answer": "Looking beyond financial results is unnecessary because a profitable business always has a healthy corporate culture regardless of the management style used", "explanation": "Profitability can exist alongside toxic culture; high turnover or low morale can eventually erode even strong financial results." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Their consultative style has no impact on motivation because employees only care about salary and do not value being consulted on business decisions", "explanation": "Research consistently shows employees value having input; consultative management improves motivation beyond what financial rewards alone achieve." },
        { "answer": "Their style harms business performance because the time spent consulting employees slows down every decision and eliminates any competitive advantage", "explanation": "While consultation takes time, the improved quality of decisions and employee commitment typically outweigh the time cost." },

      "correct": "The participative style creates a positive culture of professional engagement among teachers but the slower decision-making affects stakeholder perceptions, requiring the principal to balance collaboration with timely communication to external stakeholders",
      "correctExplanation": "Participative management has genuine trade-offs: internal culture benefits must be balanced against external stakeholder expectations for timely decisions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Parent complaints prove that participative management always fails in education because schools should only use autocratic management styles", "explanation": "Parent concerns about speed do not invalidate the benefits of teacher engagement; the issue is communication, not the style itself." },
        { "answer": "Teacher satisfaction is irrelevant because parents are the only stakeholders that matter and their preferences should determine every school decision", "explanation": "Both teacher engagement and parent satisfaction matter; effective management addresses both stakeholder groups." },
        { "answer": "The principal should exclude teachers from all decisions to speed up the process because efficiency is always more important than teacher involvement", "explanation": "Teacher involvement improves curriculum quality and professional commitment; the solution is better communication with parents, not exclusion of teachers." }
