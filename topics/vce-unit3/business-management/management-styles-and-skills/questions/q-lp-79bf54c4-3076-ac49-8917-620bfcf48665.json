Its SWOT analysis reveals strong brand loyalty (strength), limited aircraft fleet (weakness), growing tourism to regional areas (opportunity), and rising fuel costs (threat). Evaluate which SWOT finding should most influence the action plan and justify why.",
      "correct": "The limited fleet (weakness) should most influence the plan because it directly constrains the airline's ability to capture the tourism opportunity, requiring fleet investment or partnerships",
      "correctExplanation": "Without addressing the fleet limitation, the airline cannot act on the tourism opportunity regardless of brand loyalty; the weakness is the binding constraint on the entire expansion strategy.",

Analyse what this evaluation reveals about the planning process.",
      "correct": "The goals may have been too narrow, focusing on quantity rather than quality; future planning should include both measurable and qualitative goals",
