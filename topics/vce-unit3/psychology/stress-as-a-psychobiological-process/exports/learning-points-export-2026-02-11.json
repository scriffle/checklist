      "code": "1.1",
      "what": "Stress is a state of physiological and psychological arousal produced by internal or external stressors that are perceived as challenging or exceeding a person's resources to cope. It involves both biological (e.g. hormonal changes) and psychological (e.g. perception of threat) components.",
      "why": "The term 'psychobiological' signals that exam answers about stress should integrate both biological and psychological dimensions rather than treating them separately.",
      "example": "A student experiencing exam stress has both a physiological response (increased heart rate, sweating due to sympathetic nervous system activation) and a psychological response (anxiety, difficulty concentrating due to perceiving the exam as threatening).",

        "why": "Understanding these foundational concepts is essential because every other topic in this chapter builds on them. Exam questions frequently test whether students can correctly identify eustress vs distress as responses (not types of stressors) and classify stressors as internal or external."

      "title": "I can distinguish between eustress and distress as types of stress responses",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Eustress is a positive stress response characterised by motivation, excitement, and focused energy when a stressor is perceived as manageable. Distress is a negative stress response characterised by anxiety, tension, or helplessness when a stressor is perceived as threatening or overwhelming.",
      "why": "A common exam error is treating eustress and distress as types of stressors rather than types of responses. The same stressor can produce eustress in one person and distress in another depending on perception.",
      "example": "A job interview produces eustress in a well-prepared candidate who feels confident (motivation, alertness) but distress in someone who feels underprepared (anxiety, dread). The stressor is the same; the responses differ based on perception.",

      "what": "Internal stressors originate within the individual (e.g. negative self-talk, chronic pain, perfectionism). External stressors originate from the environment and range from daily hassles to catastrophes.",
      "why": "Correctly classifying stressors matters because internal stressors often involve psychological processes while external stressors involve environmental demands, and this distinction connects to how different stress models explain the stress response.",
      "example": "Internal: a student's belief that 'I always fail at maths' (negative self-talk). External: the 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires (catastrophe), a homework deadline (daily hassle), or moving to a new country and facing language barriers (acculturative stress).",

      "code": "2.1",
      "what": "When the amygdala detects a threat, it signals the hypothalamus, which activates the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal medulla releases adrenaline and noradrenaline, producing rapid changes: increased heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, pupil dilation, sweating, and blood redistribution from digestive organs to skeletal muscles.",
      "why": "Understanding this pathway is essential for explaining acute stress responses in exam scenarios and for correctly linking biological structures to their functions.",
      "example": "A hiker encounters a snake on the trail. The amygdala detects the threat, the sympathetic NS activates, the adrenal medulla releases adrenaline, and the hiker's heart races, breathing quickens, and muscles tense — preparing the body to run (flight) or confront the threat (fight).",

      "title": "I can explain the freeze response and identify the parasympathetic nervous system as dominant",
      "code": "2.2",
      "what": "The freeze response occurs when a threat seems overwhelming or inescapable. Unlike fight and flight, the parasympathetic nervous system overrides the sympathetic NS, causing tonic immobility: body movements stop, heart rate decelerates, blood pressure drops, and the person may feel unable to move or speak.",
      "why": "The 2023 examiners' report noted many students incorrectly identified the sympathetic NS as dominant during freeze. This is a frequently tested distinction worth memorising precisely.",
      "example": "During an armed robbery, a person freezes — they cannot move, speak, or call for help. Their heart rate drops and muscles become rigid. This is the parasympathetic NS overriding the sympathetic NS, producing tonic immobility rather than the heightened arousal of fight or flight.",

      "code": "2.3",
      "what": "The adrenal medulla (inner part of the adrenal gland) releases adrenaline during acute, short-term stress via the sympathetic NS. The adrenal cortex (outer layer) releases cortisol during chronic, long-term stress via the HPA axis (hypothalamus releases CRH, pituitary releases ACTH, adrenal cortex releases cortisol).",
      "why": "In 2024, students confused cortisol depletion with adrenaline depletion when answering questions about the exhaustion stage of GAS. Using the correct hormone and adrenal structure for the correct stress context is critical for earning marks.",
      "example": "Acute stress: nearly avoiding a car accident triggers adrenaline release from the adrenal medulla, causing a brief spike in heart rate and alertness. Chronic stress: months of workplace bullying triggers sustained cortisol release from the adrenal cortex via the HPA axis, eventually leading to immune suppression and fatigue.",

Signals travel in both directions: the brain influences the gut (e.g. stress alters gut microbiota via cortisol), and the gut influences the brain (e.g. gut bacteria produce neurotransmitters that affect mood).",
      "why": "The word 'bidirectional' is key to answering GBA questions correctly. Many students only describe one direction of communication and lose marks.",
      "example": "Bidirectional: Chronic exam stress (brain to gut) increases cortisol, which reduces the diversity of gut microbiota. In turn, the disrupted gut microbiota (gut to brain) reduces serotonin production, worsening the student's mood and anxiety.",

      "title": "I can explain the role of the vagus nerve in the gut-brain axis",
      "code": "3.2",
      "what": "The vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve and the primary neural link between the gut and brain. Approximately 80-90% of its fibres are afferent (carrying information from the gut to the brain), while only 10-20% are efferent (brain to gut). This means the gut sends far more information to the brain than vice versa.",
      "why": "The predominantly afferent nature of the vagus nerve is a commonly tested detail. Bravo et al. (2011) showed that cutting the vagus nerve eliminated the stress-reducing effects of a probiotic in mice, confirming the vagus nerve as the key communication pathway.",
      "example": "Bravo et al. (2011): Mice fed Lactobacillus rhamnosus showed reduced anxiety and altered GABA receptor expression in the brain. When the vagus nerve was severed, these benefits disappeared entirely — demonstrating that gut bacteria influence the brain specifically through the vagus nerve.",

      "what": "Gut microbiota are the trillions of microorganisms in the GI tract. A diverse and balanced microbiota is associated with reduced stress reactivity, while dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) is linked to increased anxiety and depression. Gut microbiota produce approximately 95% of the body's serotonin, as well as GABA and dopamine.",
      "why": "Understanding that gut bacteria produce neurotransmitters links the GBA to the broader nervous system content in Unit 3 and provides the biological mechanism for how diet and gut health can influence mental wellbeing.",

      "why": "Acknowledging the limitations of current GBA research shows evaluative thinking, which earns marks in extended responses. Students who present GBA findings as established fact without noting limitations miss the nuance the VCAA expects.",

      "example": "GAS has strong explanatory power for Mei's workplace burnout: her chronic 60-hour weeks have persisted for months, and her symptoms (exhaustion, frequent colds, high blood pressure) are consistent with the exhaustion stage, where prolonged cortisol exposure depletes resources and suppresses immune function.",
