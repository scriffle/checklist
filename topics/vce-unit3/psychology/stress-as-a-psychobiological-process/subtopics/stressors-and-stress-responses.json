  "icon": "⚡",
  "what": "This subtopic covers the definitions of stress, stressors, eustress, and distress, as well as the distinction between internal and external stressors and the physiological and psychological dimensions of the stress response.",
  "why": "Understanding these foundational concepts is essential because every other topic in this chapter builds on them. Exam questions frequently test whether students can correctly identify eustress vs distress as responses (not types of stressors) and classify stressors as internal or external.",

      "title": "I can define stress as a psychobiological process",
      "code": "1.1",
      "what": "Stress is a state of physiological and psychological arousal produced by internal or external stressors that are perceived as challenging or exceeding a person's resources to cope. It involves both biological (e.g. hormonal changes) and psychological (e.g. perception of threat) components.",
      "why": "The term 'psychobiological' signals that exam answers about stress should integrate both biological and psychological dimensions rather than treating them separately.",
      "example": "A student experiencing exam stress has both a physiological response (increased heart rate, sweating due to sympathetic nervous system activation) and a psychological response (anxiety, difficulty concentrating due to perceiving the exam as threatening).",

      "title": "I can distinguish between eustress and distress as types of stress responses",
      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "Eustress is a positive stress response characterised by motivation, excitement, and focused energy when a stressor is perceived as manageable. Distress is a negative stress response characterised by anxiety, tension, or helplessness when a stressor is perceived as threatening or overwhelming.",
      "why": "A common exam error is treating eustress and distress as types of stressors rather than types of responses. The same stressor can produce eustress in one person and distress in another depending on perception.",
      "example": "A job interview produces eustress in a well-prepared candidate who feels confident (motivation, alertness) but distress in someone who feels underprepared (anxiety, dread). The stressor is the same; the responses differ based on perception.",

      "title": "I can distinguish between internal and external stressors with examples",
      "code": "1.3",
      "what": "Internal stressors originate within the individual (e.g. negative self-talk, chronic pain, perfectionism). External stressors originate from the environment and range from daily hassles to catastrophes.",
      "why": "Correctly classifying stressors matters because internal stressors often involve psychological processes while external stressors involve environmental demands, and this distinction connects to how different stress models explain the stress response.",
      "example": "Internal: a student's belief that 'I always fail at maths' (negative self-talk). External: the 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires (catastrophe), a homework deadline (daily hassle), or moving to a new country and facing language barriers (acculturative stress).",

      "title": "I can describe physiological and psychological stress responses",
      "code": "1.4",
      "what": "Physiological responses include increased heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, muscle tension, and elevated cortisol and adrenaline. Psychological responses include cognitive effects (difficulty concentrating, racing thoughts), emotional effects (anxiety, irritability), and behavioural effects (withdrawal, procrastination, substance use).",
      "why": "Exam questions often present a scenario and ask you to identify or explain specific stress responses. Being able to categorise responses as physiological or psychological demonstrates understanding of the psychobiological nature of stress.",
      "example": "Marcus, caring full-time for his elderly mother for two years, shows physiological responses (frequent colds from immune suppression, high blood pressure) and psychological responses (exhaustion, emotional fatigue, possible withdrawal from social activities).",
