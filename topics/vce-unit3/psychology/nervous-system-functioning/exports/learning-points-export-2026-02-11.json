      "what": "The nervous system divides into the Central Nervous System (CNS), consisting of the brain and spinal cord, and the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), consisting of all nerves and neurons outside the brain and spinal cord.",
      "why": "This is the most fundamental distinction in nervous system organisation. Every exam question about neural pathways requires you to identify whether a structure belongs to the CNS or PNS.",
      "example": "The brain interpreting the taste of food is a CNS function (processing). The nerves carrying taste signals from your tongue to your brain are part of the PNS (transmission).",

      "code": "1.2",
      "what": "The somatic nervous system controls voluntary skeletal muscle movement and carries sensory information to the CNS. Sensory (afferent) neurons carry information toward the CNS. Motor (efferent) neurons carry commands away from the CNS to muscles.",
      "why": "Distinguishing afferent from efferent pathways is critical for describing any neural pathway in an exam response. The mnemonic SAME (Sensory = Afferent, Motor = Efferent) can help you remember.",
      "example": "When you kick a soccer ball, sensory (afferent) neurons carry visual information about the ball's position to your brain, and motor (efferent) neurons carry the command from your brain to your leg muscles to perform the kick.",

      "why": "Interneurons are a key component of the spinal reflex arc and are involved in all complex CNS processing. Forgetting to include them in reflex pathway descriptions is a common exam error.",
      "example": "In a spinal reflex, when you touch a hot surface, an interneuron in the spinal cord relays the signal from the sensory neuron directly to the motor neuron, enabling a rapid withdrawal response.",

      "why": "Understanding the three ANS subdivisions is essential for explaining the fight-flight-freeze response (Chapter 2), stress physiology, and the gut-brain axis. These concepts appear across Units 3 and 4.",
      "example": "During a job interview, the sympathetic NS increases your heart rate and sweating. Afterwards, the parasympathetic NS slows your heart rate and promotes digestion. Meanwhile, the enteric NS continues regulating gut motility semi-independently.",

      "what": "Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions are active simultaneously at all times. One division is dominant at any given moment, but the other is still functioning at a lower level. This is called autonomic dominance.",
      "why": "Treating the two divisions as a simple on/off switch is a common exam error. Using the term 'autonomic dominance' demonstrates precise understanding and earns marks in extended responses.",
      "example": "Even during intense sympathetic activation while running from danger, the parasympathetic NS is still active at a low level. After escaping, parasympathetic dominance gradually returns, slowing heart rate and resuming digestion.",

      "what": "A conscious response involves awareness and is typically voluntary. The pathway runs from sensory receptors, via afferent neurons to the CNS, where the cerebral cortex processes the information and generates a deliberate response sent via efferent neurons to skeletal muscles.",
      "why": "Conscious response pathways are a common exam question type. You need to identify every step and name each neuron type to earn full marks.",
      "example": "You see a ball flying toward you (sensory receptors detect light). Afferent neurons carry the signal to your brain. Your cerebral cortex decides to catch it. Efferent neurons carry the command to your arm muscles, and you raise your hands.",

      "code": "2.2",
      "what": "Autonomic responses such as heart rate, breathing, and digestion are unconscious and involuntary, but they still involve the brain — specifically the brainstem, which contains regulatory centres for vital functions. Only spinal reflexes bypass the brain initially.",
      "why": "This is a high-frequency exam error. The 2023 VCAA examiner report explicitly clarified that autonomic responses require both the brain (brainstem) and the spinal cord. Stating that all unconscious responses bypass the brain will cost marks.",
      "example": "When you exercise, your heart rate increases automatically (unconsciously). This is regulated by the cardiovascular centre in the brainstem, not bypassing the brain. The brainstem detects increased oxygen demand and sends signals via the sympathetic NS to increase heart rate.",

      "title": "I can describe the spinal reflex arc and the sequence of neuron types involved",
      "code": "2.3",
      "what": "A spinal reflex is a rapid, involuntary response initiated at the spinal cord without initial brain involvement. The sequence is: sensory receptor detects stimulus, afferent neuron carries signal to spinal cord, interneuron relays to motor neuron, efferent neuron signals the muscle, and the withdrawal response occurs. The signal also ascends to the brain simultaneously, but the reflex is already complete.",
      "why": "Spinal reflex questions appeared in both the 2023 and 2024 exams. In 2024, 64% of students scored zero because they gave generic definitions without linking to the scenario. Always describe the reflex using the specific details from the question.",
      "example": "Priya touches a hot stovetop. Sensory receptors in her skin detect the heat. An afferent neuron carries the signal to her spinal cord. An interneuron relays it to a motor (efferent) neuron, which signals her arm muscles to contract. She pulls her hand away before her brain even registers the pain.",

      "what": "Spinal reflexes bypass the brain's processing time, enabling the body to respond to threats in 20–50 milliseconds, compared to 150–300 milliseconds for a conscious response. This speed difference can prevent serious injury.",
      "why": "Understanding why spinal reflexes exist (survival advantage through speed) helps you explain their function in exam scenarios, rather than just describing the pathway mechanically.",
      "example": "The difference between a spinal reflex (approximately 30 ms) and a conscious response (approximately 200 ms) to touching a hot pan could be the difference between a minor reddening of the skin and a severe burn requiring medical treatment.",

An autonomic response (e.g. heart rate regulation) is unconscious but still involves the brain, specifically the brainstem, which monitors and regulates the response.",
      "why": "This distinction is directly tested in VCAA exams and is where many students lose marks. Being able to clearly articulate the difference shows precise understanding of both response types.",
      "example": "Pulling your hand from a flame is a spinal reflex — the spinal cord initiates the response before the brain is involved. Your heart rate increasing during a scary movie is an autonomic response — the brainstem detects the emotional arousal and signals the heart to beat faster.",

      "why": "Knowing the structure of a neuron is prerequisite knowledge for understanding synaptic transmission, the action potential, and neural plasticity. Labelling questions appear frequently on exams.",
      "example": "A motor neuron running from the spinal cord to a toe muscle has dendrites in the spinal cord receiving signals, a soma containing the nucleus, a very long axon (over 1 metre) wrapped in myelin sheath, and terminal buttons that release neurotransmitters onto the muscle.",

      "what": "Within a neuron, the action potential (a brief electrical impulse) travels along the axon. Between neurons, neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) carry the signal across the synaptic cleft. Neural information flows in one direction: dendrites, soma, axon, terminal buttons, synapse, next neuron.",
      "why": "This is a fundamental principle of neural communication. Confusing electrical and chemical transmission, or describing signals as travelling in both directions, are common exam errors.",
      "example": "When you move your finger, an electrical impulse (action potential) travels along the axon of a motor neuron. When it reaches the terminal button, the signal is converted to a chemical message — neurotransmitters are released across the synapse to the muscle cell.",

      "why": "Detailed knowledge of synaptic transmission is heavily rewarded by VCAA examiners. The difference between a 1-mark and a 3-mark answer is the use of precise terminology such as 'exocytosis,' 'synaptic cleft,' and 'lock-and-key process.'",
      "example": "A presynaptic neuron fires. The action potential triggers calcium influx at the terminal button. Vesicles release glutamate via exocytosis into the synaptic cleft. Glutamate diffuses across the cleft and binds to complementary receptors on the postsynaptic dendrite (lock-and-key), producing an excitatory effect.",

      "why": "The lock-and-key concept explains why different neurotransmitters have different effects and why drugs that mimic neurotransmitter shapes can affect neural activity. This links directly to pharmacology content in Unit 4.",
      "example": "Glutamate has a specific molecular shape that fits glutamate receptors (like NMDA receptors) but does not fit GABA receptors. Similarly, GABA fits GABA receptors but not glutamate receptors. This specificity ensures that excitatory and inhibitory signals remain distinct.",

It produces EPSPs and is essential for learning, memory formation, cognitive functions, and long-term potentiation (LTP) through activation of NMDA receptors. Excess glutamate can cause excitotoxicity, damaging neurons.",

GABA prevents overexcitation, regulates anxiety by calming the amygdala, promotes sleep, and supports concentration by suppressing irrelevant neural activity. GABA is synthesised from glutamate.",

      "example": "A person with low GABA levels may experience excessive neural firing in the amygdala, leading to heightened anxiety. Benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety medication) work by enhancing GABA's inhibitory effects, increasing the calming influence on neural activity.",

There is no partial action potential.",
      "why": "Summation explains how the brain makes decisions at the cellular level — it is the mechanism by which competing excitatory and inhibitory signals are resolved into a single outcome (fire or not fire).",
      "example": "A postsynaptic neuron receives 100 EPSPs from glutamate-releasing neurons and 80 IPSPs from GABA-releasing neurons simultaneously. The net excitatory input exceeds the threshold, so the neuron fires a full-strength action potential.
