TITLE: I can explain long-term depression (LTD) as a long-lasting weakening of synapses due to lack of stimulation
CODE: 5.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
LTD is the long-lasting weakening of synaptic connections that are not regularly activated, resulting from lack of stimulation or prolonged low-level stimulation. AMPA receptors are removed from the postsynaptic membrane, reducing the neuron's sensitivity to glutamate. The connection becomes harder to activate.

WHY (importance):
LTD is equally important to learning as LTP. Without LTD, the brain would become overloaded with unnecessary connections. LTD clears unused pathways and allows the brain to allocate resources efficiently. Note that 'depression' here refers to reduced neural activity, not the mental health condition.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A person who was fluent in French as a child but has not spoken or practised French for 15 years finds it much harder to recall vocabulary and grammar. The neural pathways for French have weakened through LTD due to lack of regular activation.

SUBTOPIC: Synaptic Plasticity: LTP and LTD
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers synaptic plasticity as the brain's ability to strengthen or weaken synaptic connections in response to experience, including the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Synaptic plasticity is the neural basis of learning and memory. LTP and LTD explain how the brain encodes new information, refines skills, and discards unused connections. These concepts are heavily examined and connect to almost every other topic in VCE Psychology.

TOPIC: Nervous System Functioning
SUBJECT: Psychology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The structure and function of the nervous system, including neuron communication, neurotransmitters, and synaptic plasticity as the basis for learning and memory.

# Why It Matters

Right now, as you read this sentence, your nervous system is doing something remarkable. Your eyes are converting light into electrical signals. Those signals are racing along neurons to your brain at speeds up to 120 metres per second. Your brain is decoding the patterns into letters, words, and meaning. Meanwhile — without any conscious effort on your part — your heart is beating, your lungs are breathing, your stomach is digesting, and your body temperature is being regulated.

The nervous system is the body's command and communication network. It enables every thought, every movement, every sensation, and every emotion you experience. Understanding how it works is not just the foundation for this Area of Study — it underpins almost everything else you will study in VCE Psychology. The stress response (Chapter 2), learning and memory (AOS2), sleep (Unit 4), and even the development of mental health conditions like specific phobia all depend on the nervous system concepts you will learn in this chapter.

This is also one of the most heavily examined topics in VCE Psychology. In the 2023 and 2024 exams (the first two under this study design), nervous system questions appeared in both multiple-choice and short-answer sections every year. The good news is that much of this content is straightforward once you understand the hierarchy and the key processes. The challenge — and where marks are most commonly lost — is applying your knowledge to scenarios you have never seen before. This chapter will teach you both the content and how to use it under exam conditions.

# 1. The Nervous System Hierarchy

## 1.1 An Overview: Two Major Subdivisions

The human **nervous system** is divided into two major subdivisions based on location:

The **Central Nervous System (CNS)** consists of the **brain** and the **spinal cord**. It is the processing and coordination centre of the entire nervous system. The brain interprets sensory information, generates thoughts and emotions, stores memories, and initiates voluntary movements. The spinal cord serves as the information highway between the brain and the rest of the body, and it can also coordinate some responses independently (spinal reflexes — more on this shortly).

The **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)** consists of all the nerves and neurons that exist **outside** the brain and spinal cord. Its role is to connect the CNS to every organ, muscle, gland, and sensory receptor in the body. Think of it as the network of roads linking a central command centre (the CNS) to every part of a city (the body).

## 1.2 Subdivisions of the Peripheral Nervous System

The PNS itself divides into two functional systems:

### The Somatic Nervous System

The **somatic nervous system** controls **voluntary** movements of skeletal muscles and carries sensory information from the body to the CNS. It operates through two types of neural pathways:

**Sensory (afferent) neurons** carry information **toward** the CNS — from sensory receptors in the skin, eyes, ears, and other organs to the brain or spinal cord for processing. The word "afferent" comes from the Latin *ad* (toward) and *ferre* (to carry).

**Motor (efferent) neurons** carry commands **away from** the CNS — from the brain or spinal cord to skeletal muscles, producing voluntary movements. The word "efferent" comes from the Latin *ex* (away from) and *ferre* (to carry).

A helpful mnemonic is **SAME**: **S**ensory = **A**fferent, **M**otor = **E**fferent.

**Interneurons** are the third neuron type. They exist only within the CNS (brain and spinal cord) and relay signals between sensory and motor neurons. They are critical for processing, integration, and decision-making within the CNS.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The VCAA examiners have noted in both 2023 and 2024 that students frequently say neurons "travel" to the brain. Neurons do not travel anywhere — they are fixed in place. **Neural information** (electrical impulses and chemical signals) travels **along** neurons. This distinction matters for marks on neural pathway and spinal reflex questions.

### The Autonomic Nervous System

The **autonomic nervous system (ANS)** controls **involuntary** functions — processes that occur automatically without conscious effort, such as heart rate, breathing, digestion, and gland secretion. The ANS has three subdivisions:

**The sympathetic nervous system** prepares the body for vigorous activity or threat response. When dominant, it produces the physiological changes associated with arousal: increased heart rate and blood pressure, bronchiole dilation (for more oxygen intake), pupil dilation, blood redistribution from the digestive system to skeletal muscles, increased sweating, and glucose mobilisation for energy. The sympathetic division is dominant during the fight-or-flight response.

**The parasympathetic nervous system** restores the body to a calm, resting state after sympathetic activation. When dominant, it slows heart rate, constricts pupils, stimulates digestion, and promotes energy conservation. This is sometimes called the "rest and digest" system. Critically, the parasympathetic division is also dominant during the **freeze** response — a point we will return to in Chapter 2.

**The enteric nervous system (ENS)** is a mesh-like network of neurons embedded in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract. Often called the "second brain," it is capable of semi-autonomous function — it can regulate digestion and gut motility independently of the brain, although it communicates with the CNS via the vagus nerve. The ENS is central to the **gut-brain axis**, which you will study in Chapter 2.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** A very common error is treating the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions as an on/off switch — as if one is completely "on" while the other is completely "off." In reality, both operate simultaneously at all times. One is merely **dominant** at any given time. For example, even during intense sympathetic activation (such as running from danger), the parasympathetic division is still active at a low level. This is the concept of **autonomic dominance**, and using this precise language in your exam responses demonstrates sophisticated understanding.

### Standard Diagram: The Nervous System Hierarchy

The standard VCE flowchart for the nervous system hierarchy appears in every major textbook (Jacaranda 8th ed., Edrolo, Nelson) and is frequently the basis for exam questions. You should be able to draw this from memory:

```

                       (Afferent)(Efferent)  NS    NS    NS
```

# 2. Conscious and Unconscious Responses

## 2.1 Conscious Responses

A **conscious response** involves **awareness** and is typically **voluntary**. It always involves the **cerebral cortex** (the outer layer of the brain responsible for higher-order thinking). The pathway is:

1. Sensory receptor detects a stimulus (e.g. you see a ball flying toward you)
2. Sensory (afferent) neurons carry the signal via the PNS to the CNS
3. The brain (specifically the cerebral cortex) processes and interprets the information
4. The brain generates a deliberate response
5. Motor (efferent) neurons carry the command from the CNS via the PNS to skeletal muscles
6. The voluntary movement occurs (e.g. you raise your hands to catch the ball)

## 2.2 Unconscious Responses

An **unconscious response** occurs **without awareness** and is **involuntary**. However — and this is where many students make errors — there are **two different types** of unconscious response, and they involve different nervous system structures:

### Type 1: Autonomic Responses

Autonomic responses such as heart rate regulation, breathing, and digestion are unconscious and involuntary. However, they **still involve the brain** — specifically the **brainstem**, which sits at the base of the brain and connects it to the spinal cord. The brainstem contains centres that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and other vital functions.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** In 2023, 55% of students answered a multiple-choice question incorrectly because they believed all unconscious responses bypass the brain. The VCAA examiner report explicitly clarified: "Unconscious responses of the autonomic nervous system, such as heart rate and breathing, require the involvement of both the brain (brainstem) and spinal cord." Only **spinal reflexes** bypass the brain initially.

### Type 2: Spinal Reflexes

A **spinal reflex** is a rapid, involuntary response that is initiated at the spinal cord **without the brain's involvement initially**. The response occurs before the brain even receives the sensory information. The classic example is the withdrawal reflex — pulling your hand away from a hot surface before you consciously feel the pain.

The **spinal reflex arc** follows this sequence:

1. A **sensory receptor** in the skin detects the stimulus (e.g. extreme heat)
2. A **sensory (afferent) neuron** carries the signal to the spinal cord
3. An **interneuron** in the spinal cord relays the signal directly to a motor neuron
4. A **motor (efferent) neuron** carries the command to the relevant muscle
5. The muscle contracts, producing the withdrawal response (e.g. pulling your hand away)
6. **Simultaneously**, the sensory signal ascends to the brain via the spinal cord — but by the time the brain processes the pain, the reflex has already occurred

The biological advantage of spinal reflexes is **speed**. By bypassing the brain's processing time, the body can respond to threats in as little as 20–50 milliseconds — far faster than a conscious response, which might take 150–300 milliseconds. This can be the difference between a minor burn and a severe injury.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The 2023 and 2024 exams both included questions on spinal reflexes. In 2024, 64% of students scored zero on a question about the somatic nervous system and spinal cord's roles in a reflex because they provided generic definitions without connecting them to the specific scenario described in the question. Remember the golden rule: **always link your answer to the scenario**. If the question describes a person touching a hot pan, your answer must reference the hot pan, the hand, and the specific muscles involved — not just define "sensory neuron" and "motor neuron" in the abstract.

# 3. Neuron Structure and Synaptic Transmission

## 3.1 The Structure of a Neuron

A **neuron** (nerve cell) is the fundamental unit of the nervous system. Although neurons come in different shapes and sizes depending on their function, they share a common basic structure:

**Dendrites** are short, branching extensions that **receive** signals from other neurons or sensory receptors. A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites, allowing it to receive input from many sources simultaneously.

**The soma (cell body)** contains the **nucleus** and is the neuron's metabolic centre. It integrates all incoming signals from the dendrites and determines whether the combined input is sufficient to generate an action potential.

**The axon** is a single, long, tube-like extension that transmits electrical impulses **away from** the soma toward the next neuron or target cell. Axons can range from less than a millimetre to over a metre in length (such as the motor neurons running from the spinal cord to the toes).

**The myelin sheath** is a white, fatty insulating layer that wraps around the axon in segments. It serves two critical functions: it **speeds up** the transmission of electrical impulses by enabling saltatory conduction (the impulse "jumps" between gaps rather than travelling continuously), and it **protects** the signal from degradation or interference.

**Nodes of Ranvier** are the small gaps between segments of the myelin sheath. The action potential "jumps" from node to node — a process called **saltatory conduction** — which is far faster than continuous conduction along an unmyelinated axon.

**Terminal buttons (axon terminals)** are the enlarged endpoints of the axon's branches. They contain **synaptic vesicles** — small sacs that store **neurotransmitters** (the chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons).

### A Fundamental Principle

Communication **within** a neuron is **electrical** — the action potential (a brief electrical impulse) travels along the axon. Communication **between** neurons is **chemical** — neurotransmitters carry the signal across the gap between neurons. Neural information travels in **one direction only**: dendrites → soma → axon → terminal buttons → synapse → next neuron's dendrites.

## 3.2 Synaptic Transmission: How Neurons Communicate

The **synapse** (or synaptic cleft) is the tiny gap between the terminal button of one neuron (the **presynaptic neuron**) and the dendrite of the next neuron (the **postsynaptic neuron**). Neurons do not physically touch each other — the synapse is a fluid-filled space approximately 20 nanometres wide.

The process of **synaptic transmission** occurs in a precise sequence:

1. An **action potential** arrives at the presynaptic terminal button
2. The arrival of the action potential causes **calcium ion channels** to open; calcium ions flood into the terminal
3. The influx of calcium triggers **synaptic vesicles** to move toward and **fuse** with the presynaptic membrane
4. **Neurotransmitters** are released from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft via a process called **exocytosis**
5. The neurotransmitters **diffuse** across the synaptic cleft
6. The neurotransmitters **bind** to **complementary receptor sites** on the postsynaptic neuron's dendrite — this is called the **lock-and-key process**, because each neurotransmitter has a specific molecular shape that must match the shape of the receptor (like a key fitting into a lock)
7. The binding triggers either an **excitatory** or **inhibitory** effect on the postsynaptic neuron (explained in the next section)
8. The remaining neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft are cleared by one of three mechanisms: **reuptake** (absorbed back into the presynaptic terminal for recycling), **enzymatic degradation** (broken down by enzymes in the cleft), or **diffusion** (drifting away from the synapse)

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The VCAA examiners consistently reward precise, technical language in synaptic transmission responses. Compare these two answers to a question asking how a neural signal crosses a synapse:
>
> **Weak answer (1/3 marks):** "The message goes across the gap between the neurons using chemicals."
>
> **Strong answer (3/3 marks):** "The neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic terminal button into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis. It diffuses across the cleft and binds to complementary receptor sites on the postsynaptic neuron's dendrite via the lock-and-key process, producing either an excitatory or inhibitory effect."
>
> The difference is terminology. Both answers describe the same process, but the strong answer uses the precise terms the examiners are looking for.

# 4. Neurotransmitters: Glutamate and GABA

## 4.1 Excitatory and Inhibitory Effects

When a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces one of two effects:

An **Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP)** makes the postsynaptic neuron **more likely to fire** an action potential. It does this by causing a small **depolarisation** — a shift in the neuron's electrical charge toward the threshold needed to trigger an action potential.

An **Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP)** makes the postsynaptic neuron **less likely to fire** an action potential. It does this by causing a **hyperpolarisation** — a shift in the neuron's electrical charge further away from the threshold.

Whether a neurotransmitter produces an EPSP or IPSP depends on both the neurotransmitter itself and the type of receptor it binds to on the postsynaptic neuron.

## 4.2 Glutamate: The Primary Excitatory Neurotransmitter

**Glutamate** is the brain's **most common excitatory neurotransmitter**, responsible for approximately 75% of all excitatory transmission in the brain. When glutamate binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces an **EPSP**, making that neuron more likely to fire.

Glutamate is essential for:

- **Learning and memory formation** — it is the neurotransmitter most directly involved in synaptic plasticity
- **Cognitive functions** including attention, problem-solving, and information processing
- **Long-term potentiation (LTP)** — glutamate activates NMDA receptors, which are fundamental to the strengthening of synaptic connections (covered in Section 5)

When glutamate levels are abnormally high, excess stimulation can damage and destroy neurons — a process called **excitotoxicity**. This mechanism has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

## 4.3 GABA: The Primary Inhibitory Neurotransmitter

**GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid)** is the brain's **most common inhibitory neurotransmitter**, present at approximately 30–40% of all synapses. When GABA binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces an **IPSP**, making that neuron less likely to fire.

GABA plays a critical regulatory role in:

- **Preventing neural overexcitation** — without GABA, neurons would fire uncontrollably, potentially causing seizures
- **Managing anxiety** — adequate GABA levels help regulate the amygdala's fear response
- **Promoting sleep** — GABA inhibits wakefulness-promoting circuits
- **Concentration and focus** — by suppressing irrelevant neural activity

An important biological fact: GABA is actually **synthesised from glutamate**. The two neurotransmitters are chemically related — glutamate is converted to GABA by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). This means the brain's most important excitatory chemical is the direct precursor of its most important inhibitory chemical — an elegant balance.

**Low GABA levels** are associated with anxiety disorders, insomnia, and epilepsy. This has clinical significance: **benzodiazepines** (a class of medication used to treat anxiety) work by enhancing GABA's inhibitory effects at the synapse, effectively increasing its calming influence on neural activity. You will encounter benzodiazepines again in Unit 4 when studying the treatment of specific phobia.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The relationship between GABA and anxiety/phobia has been directly examined in both 2023 (SA Q7d, 5 marks — benzodiazepines as GABA agonists) and 2024 (MC Q40 — GABA dysfunction in phobias). Students need to be able to explain the three-step chain: **insufficient GABA → unregulated neural activity in the amygdala → heightened, persistent fear response**. This chain connects U3 AOS1 (neurotransmitters) directly to Unit 4 AOS2 (biopsychosocial contributing factors to specific phobia).

## 4.4 Summation: How the Postsynaptic Neuron "Decides"

A single EPSP is usually too weak to trigger an action potential on its own. At any given moment, the postsynaptic neuron is receiving inputs from hundreds or thousands of other neurons simultaneously — some excitatory (EPSPs) and some inhibitory (IPSPs).

**Summation** is the process by which the postsynaptic neuron integrates all incoming EPSPs and IPSPs. If the total excitatory input exceeds the total inhibitory input by enough to reach the neuron's **threshold**, an action potential fires. If it does not reach threshold, no action potential occurs.

This is called the **all-or-none principle**: an action potential either fires at full strength or does not fire at all. There is no partial action potential — it is like a light switch, not a dimmer.

# 5. Synaptic Plasticity: LTP, LTD, and Neural Modifications

## 5.1 What Is Synaptic Plasticity?

**Synaptic plasticity** is the ability of synaptic connections between neurons to **strengthen or weaken over time in response to experience**. It is the fundamental neural mechanism underlying learning and memory — when you learn something new, the physical connections between neurons in your brain change.

The two key mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation (strengthening) and long-term depression (weakening). Together, they allow the brain to adapt, form new memories, refine skills, and discard unused information.

## 5.2 Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)

**Long-term potentiation (LTP)** is the **long-lasting strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons that are frequently co-activated due to repeated stimulation**.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert — Critical Definition:** The 2024 examiner report explicitly flagged that students consistently omit the requirement for "repeated stimulation" when defining LTP. In 2024, 46% of students scored zero on a question about LTP. The complete definition must include: (1) long-lasting, (2) strengthening of a synapse, (3) due to repeated stimulation. Writing "LTP is the strengthening of a synapse" is **incomplete** and may not earn full marks. Always include "due to repeated stimulation."

The principle behind LTP is captured by **Hebb's Rule (1949)**: "Cells that fire together, wire together." When two neurons are repeatedly activated at the same time, the synaptic connection between them becomes progressively stronger and more efficient.

At the cellular level, LTP works like this: with repeated stimulation, the presynaptic neuron releases **more glutamate** into the synapse, and the postsynaptic neuron develops **more receptor sites** on its dendrites. This makes the pathway easier to activate — a smaller input can now produce a larger response. Specifically, LTP involves the activation of **NMDA receptors** (a type of glutamate receptor) and the subsequent addition of **AMPA receptors** to the postsynaptic membrane, which enhances signal reception.

A standard analogy used in VCE classrooms compares LTP to walking a path through long grass. The first time you walk through, it is difficult — the grass is tall and the path is unclear. But the more often you walk the same route, the more the grass is flattened and the path becomes established. Eventually, the path is so well-worn that walking it requires almost no effort. Similarly, the more frequently a neural pathway is activated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes.

### Research in Focus: Bliss and Lømo (1973) — The Discovery of LTP

The existence of LTP was first demonstrated experimentally by Timothy Bliss and Terje Lømo in 1973 at the University of Oslo. Working with anaesthetised rabbits, they placed stimulating electrodes on the **perforant pathway** in the hippocampus and recording electrodes on neurons in the **dentate gyrus**.

They delivered a brief burst of high-frequency electrical stimulation and then measured the response of the postsynaptic neurons. They found that after the high-frequency stimulation, the synaptic response was significantly and rapidly enhanced — the postsynaptic neurons produced **larger EPSPs** that **rose more quickly**. Remarkably, this enhancement was long-lasting: it persisted for hours in brain slices and for days to weeks in intact animals.

This was the first experimental demonstration that synapses in the mammalian brain could undergo lasting strengthening, providing cellular-level evidence for the theoretical framework that Hebb had proposed 24 years earlier. Bliss and Lømo's work is foundational to our understanding of how the brain encodes learning and memory at the synaptic level.

### Research in Focus: Maguire et al. (2000) — London Taxi Drivers

Eleanor Maguire and colleagues at University College London used MRI scanning to compare the brains of licensed London taxi drivers with control participants. London taxi drivers must pass "The Knowledge" — a gruelling qualification requiring memorisation of approximately 25,000 streets and thousands of landmarks across London, typically taking 3–4 years to complete.

Maguire found that taxi drivers had significantly **larger posterior hippocampi** (the region of the hippocampus involved in spatial memory and navigation) compared to controls. Furthermore, the volume of the posterior hippocampus was **positively correlated with years of experience** as a taxi driver — the longer they had been driving, the larger this brain region was.

A 2011 longitudinal follow-up study (Woollett & Maguire) strengthened these findings by tracking individual trainee drivers over 3–4 years, finding that those who successfully qualified showed hippocampal growth compared to their pre-training scans and to trainees who dropped out.

This research powerfully illustrates LTP, sprouting, and adaptive plasticity in humans: intensive, repeated learning produces measurable, lasting structural changes in the brain. It is the most commonly cited example of neuroplasticity in VCE Psychology.

## 5.3 Long-Term Depression (LTD)

**Long-term depression (LTD)** is the **long-lasting weakening of synaptic connections that are not regularly activated**, resulting from lack of stimulation or prolonged low-level stimulation.

When a synaptic pathway is rarely used, the postsynaptic neuron becomes **less responsive** — AMPA receptors are removed from the postsynaptic membrane, reducing the neuron's sensitivity to glutamate. The connection weakens, making it harder to activate. Eventually, unused connections may be eliminated entirely (pruning — see Section 5.4).

LTD is often overlooked by students, but it is **equally important** to learning as LTP. Without LTD, the brain would become overloaded with unnecessary connections. LTD clears unused pathways and refines neural networks, allowing the brain to operate efficiently and allocate resources to the connections that matter most.

The standard analogy is the reverse of the LTP path analogy: a path through long grass that stops being used will gradually become overgrown until it is no longer navigable.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The term "depression" in LTD refers to **reduced neural activity** at the synapse — not the mental health condition. This is a common source of confusion. If a question asks about LTD, your answer should be about weakened synaptic connections, not about mood or psychological distress.

## 5.4 Neural Modifications: Sprouting, Rerouting, and Pruning

LTP and LTD together drive three types of structural modification in neural networks:

### Sprouting

**Sprouting** is the growth of **new dendritic or axonal branches** to form new synaptic connections. It occurs when neural pathways are frequently activated (via LTP), stimulating the neuron to grow additional branches that create connections with neighbouring neurons.

**Analogy:** A tree growing new branches in the direction of sunlight — it extends toward the resources it needs.

**Example:** When you learn a new skill like playing piano, the repeated practice strengthens existing neural pathways (LTP) and stimulates the growth of new connections (sprouting) between the motor cortex, cerebellum, and auditory cortex. Over time, a dense network of connections forms, supporting fluid, coordinated performance.

### Rerouting

**Rerouting** is the redirection of existing neural connections to create **alternative pathways**, often around damaged or dysfunctional neurons. This is a key mechanism of recovery after brain injury.

**Analogy:** When a road is flooded, traffic is redirected via a detour to reach the same destination by a different route.

**Example:** After a stroke damages neurons in the motor cortex controlling the right hand, surviving neurons may form new connections that partially restore hand function — the signals find alternative routes to reach the same muscles.

### Pruning

**Pruning** is the elimination of **weak, unused synaptic connections**. It is driven by LTD — connections that are not regularly activated weaken progressively until they are removed entirely.

**Analogy:** Trimming dead or unproductive branches from a tree so that the remaining branches receive maximum nutrients and grow more strongly.

**Example:** Infants are born with far more synaptic connections than adults. During childhood and adolescence, the brain undergoes extensive pruning — eliminating connections that are not reinforced by experience while strengthening those that are. This is why early experiences are so influential in shaping brain development. The principle is sometimes summarised as "use it or lose it."

Pruning is not negative — it is essential for efficient brain function. A pruned, refined neural network operates faster and more efficiently than an overgrown, unfocused one.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** When discussing sprouting, rerouting, and pruning in exam responses, always connect them to either LTP or LTD. Sprouting and rerouting result from **LTP** (strengthening and growth). Pruning results from **LTD** (weakening and elimination). Simply listing the three modifications without explaining their relationship to LTP/LTD will cost you marks on questions that ask you to explain how synaptic plasticity modifies neural connections.

# 6. Bringing It All Together: How the Nervous System Enables Psychological Functioning

The content in this chapter is not a set of isolated facts — it forms an integrated system. Understanding how the parts connect is essential for high-level exam responses.

The **nervous system hierarchy** (Section 1) tells you which structures are responsible for different types of responses. The **neuron and synaptic transmission** (Sections 3–4) tells you how signals are communicated within and between these structures. **Synaptic plasticity** (Section 5) tells you how these communication pathways change with experience, enabling learning and memory.

When a VCAA exam question gives you a scenario — say, a person learning to drive a car — you should be able to trace the process through multiple levels:

- The somatic NS carries sensory information (visual, auditory, tactile) to the CNS for processing
- The brain's motor cortex generates voluntary commands transmitted via motor neurons to skeletal muscles
- The ANS regulates involuntary responses (heart rate increasing during stressful traffic situations)
- With practice, the neural pathways involved in driving are strengthened through LTP — glutamate release increases, more receptor sites develop, and the pathways become easier to activate
- Sprouting creates new connections between relevant brain regions
- Pathways for incorrect or unnecessary responses weaken through LTD and are eventually pruned
- Eventually, many driving actions become near-automatic — the pathways are so well-established that conscious effort is minimal

This kind of integrated, multi-level response is what earns top marks on extended-answer questions.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:

LEARNING POINT CONTEXT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TITLE: I can explain long-term depression (LTD) as a long-lasting weakening of synapses due to lack of stimulation
CODE: 5.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
LTD is the long-lasting weakening of synaptic connections that are not regularly activated, resulting from lack of stimulation or prolonged low-level stimulation. AMPA receptors are removed from the postsynaptic membrane, reducing the neuron's sensitivity to glutamate. The connection becomes harder to activate.

WHY (importance):
LTD is equally important to learning as LTP. Without LTD, the brain would become overloaded with unnecessary connections. LTD clears unused pathways and allows the brain to allocate resources efficiently. Note that 'depression' here refers to reduced neural activity, not the mental health condition.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A person who was fluent in French as a child but has not spoken or practised French for 15 years finds it much harder to recall vocabulary and grammar. The neural pathways for French have weakened through LTD due to lack of regular activation.

SUBTOPIC: Synaptic Plasticity: LTP and LTD
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers synaptic plasticity as the brain's ability to strengthen or weaken synaptic connections in response to experience, including the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Synaptic plasticity is the neural basis of learning and memory. LTP and LTD explain how the brain encodes new information, refines skills, and discards unused connections. These concepts are heavily examined and connect to almost every other topic in VCE Psychology.

TOPIC: Nervous System Functioning
SUBJECT: Psychology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The structure and function of the nervous system, including neuron communication, neurotransmitters, and synaptic plasticity as the basis for learning and memory.

# Why It Matters

Right now, as you read this sentence, your nervous system is doing something remarkable. Your eyes are converting light into electrical signals. Those signals are racing along neurons to your brain at speeds up to 120 metres per second. Your brain is decoding the patterns into letters, words, and meaning. Meanwhile — without any conscious effort on your part — your heart is beating, your lungs are breathing, your stomach is digesting, and your body temperature is being regulated.

The nervous system is the body's command and communication network. It enables every thought, every movement, every sensation, and every emotion you experience. Understanding how it works is not just the foundation for this Area of Study — it underpins almost everything else you will study in VCE Psychology. The stress response (Chapter 2), learning and memory (AOS2), sleep (Unit 4), and even the development of mental health conditions like specific phobia all depend on the nervous system concepts you will learn in this chapter.

This is also one of the most heavily examined topics in VCE Psychology. In the 2023 and 2024 exams (the first two under this study design), nervous system questions appeared in both multiple-choice and short-answer sections every year. The good news is that much of this content is straightforward once you understand the hierarchy and the key processes. The challenge — and where marks are most commonly lost — is applying your knowledge to scenarios you have never seen before. This chapter will teach you both the content and how to use it under exam conditions.

# 1. The Nervous System Hierarchy

## 1.1 An Overview: Two Major Subdivisions

The human **nervous system** is divided into two major subdivisions based on location:

The **Central Nervous System (CNS)** consists of the **brain** and the **spinal cord**. It is the processing and coordination centre of the entire nervous system. The brain interprets sensory information, generates thoughts and emotions, stores memories, and initiates voluntary movements. The spinal cord serves as the information highway between the brain and the rest of the body, and it can also coordinate some responses independently (spinal reflexes — more on this shortly).

The **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)** consists of all the nerves and neurons that exist **outside** the brain and spinal cord. Its role is to connect the CNS to every organ, muscle, gland, and sensory receptor in the body. Think of it as the network of roads linking a central command centre (the CNS) to every part of a city (the body).

## 1.2 Subdivisions of the Peripheral Nervous System

The PNS itself divides into two functional systems:

### The Somatic Nervous System

The **somatic nervous system** controls **voluntary** movements of skeletal muscles and carries sensory information from the body to the CNS. It operates through two types of neural pathways:

**Sensory (afferent) neurons** carry information **toward** the CNS — from sensory receptors in the skin, eyes, ears, and other organs to the brain or spinal cord for processing. The word "afferent" comes from the Latin *ad* (toward) and *ferre* (to carry).

**Motor (efferent) neurons** carry commands **away from** the CNS — from the brain or spinal cord to skeletal muscles, producing voluntary movements. The word "efferent" comes from the Latin *ex* (away from) and *ferre* (to carry).

A helpful mnemonic is **SAME**: **S**ensory = **A**fferent, **M**otor = **E**fferent.

**Interneurons** are the third neuron type. They exist only within the CNS (brain and spinal cord) and relay signals between sensory and motor neurons. They are critical for processing, integration, and decision-making within the CNS.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The VCAA examiners have noted in both 2023 and 2024 that students frequently say neurons "travel" to the brain. Neurons do not travel anywhere — they are fixed in place. **Neural information** (electrical impulses and chemical signals) travels **along** neurons. This distinction matters for marks on neural pathway and spinal reflex questions.

### The Autonomic Nervous System

The **autonomic nervous system (ANS)** controls **involuntary** functions — processes that occur automatically without conscious effort, such as heart rate, breathing, digestion, and gland secretion. The ANS has three subdivisions:

**The sympathetic nervous system** prepares the body for vigorous activity or threat response. When dominant, it produces the physiological changes associated with arousal: increased heart rate and blood pressure, bronchiole dilation (for more oxygen intake), pupil dilation, blood redistribution from the digestive system to skeletal muscles, increased sweating, and glucose mobilisation for energy. The sympathetic division is dominant during the fight-or-flight response.

**The parasympathetic nervous system** restores the body to a calm, resting state after sympathetic activation. When dominant, it slows heart rate, constricts pupils, stimulates digestion, and promotes energy conservation. This is sometimes called the "rest and digest" system. Critically, the parasympathetic division is also dominant during the **freeze** response — a point we will return to in Chapter 2.

**The enteric nervous system (ENS)** is a mesh-like network of neurons embedded in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract. Often called the "second brain," it is capable of semi-autonomous function — it can regulate digestion and gut motility independently of the brain, although it communicates with the CNS via the vagus nerve. The ENS is central to the **gut-brain axis**, which you will study in Chapter 2.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** A very common error is treating the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions as an on/off switch — as if one is completely "on" while the other is completely "off." In reality, both operate simultaneously at all times. One is merely **dominant** at any given time. For example, even during intense sympathetic activation (such as running from danger), the parasympathetic division is still active at a low level. This is the concept of **autonomic dominance**, and using this precise language in your exam responses demonstrates sophisticated understanding.

### Standard Diagram: The Nervous System Hierarchy

The standard VCE flowchart for the nervous system hierarchy appears in every major textbook (Jacaranda 8th ed., Edrolo, Nelson) and is frequently the basis for exam questions. You should be able to draw this from memory:

```
                    NERVOUS SYSTEM
                    /            \
                 CNS              PNS
               /     \          /       \
           Brain    Spinal   Somatic    Autonomic
                    Cord       NS          NS
                             /    \      /    |    \
                        Sensory  Motor  Symp  Para  Enteric
                       (Afferent)(Efferent)  NS    NS    NS
```

# 2. Conscious and Unconscious Responses

## 2.1 Conscious Responses

A **conscious response** involves **awareness** and is typically **voluntary**. It always involves the **cerebral cortex** (the outer layer of the brain responsible for higher-order thinking). The pathway is:

1. Sensory receptor detects a stimulus (e.g. you see a ball flying toward you)
2. Sensory (afferent) neurons carry the signal via the PNS to the CNS
3. The brain (specifically the cerebral cortex) processes and interprets the information
4. The brain generates a deliberate response
5. Motor (efferent) neurons carry the command from the CNS via the PNS to skeletal muscles
6. The voluntary movement occurs (e.g. you raise your hands to catch the ball)

## 2.2 Unconscious Responses

An **unconscious response** occurs **without awareness** and is **involuntary**. However — and this is where many students make errors — there are **two different types** of unconscious response, and they involve different nervous system structures:

### Type 1: Autonomic Responses

Autonomic responses such as heart rate regulation, breathing, and digestion are unconscious and involuntary. However, they **still involve the brain** — specifically the **brainstem**, which sits at the base of the brain and connects it to the spinal cord. The brainstem contains centres that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and other vital functions.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** In 2023, 55% of students answered a multiple-choice question incorrectly because they believed all unconscious responses bypass the brain. The VCAA examiner report explicitly clarified: "Unconscious responses of the autonomic nervous system, such as heart rate and breathing, require the involvement of both the brain (brainstem) and spinal cord." Only **spinal reflexes** bypass the brain initially.

### Type 2: Spinal Reflexes

A **spinal reflex** is a rapid, involuntary response that is initiated at the spinal cord **without the brain's involvement initially**. The response occurs before the brain even receives the sensory information. The classic example is the withdrawal reflex — pulling your hand away from a hot surface before you consciously feel the pain.

The **spinal reflex arc** follows this sequence:

1. A **sensory receptor** in the skin detects the stimulus (e.g. extreme heat)
2. A **sensory (afferent) neuron** carries the signal to the spinal cord
3. An **interneuron** in the spinal cord relays the signal directly to a motor neuron
4. A **motor (efferent) neuron** carries the command to the relevant muscle
5. The muscle contracts, producing the withdrawal response (e.g. pulling your hand away)
6. **Simultaneously**, the sensory signal ascends to the brain via the spinal cord — but by the time the brain processes the pain, the reflex has already occurred

The biological advantage of spinal reflexes is **speed**. By bypassing the brain's processing time, the body can respond to threats in as little as 20–50 milliseconds — far faster than a conscious response, which might take 150–300 milliseconds. This can be the difference between a minor burn and a severe injury.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The 2023 and 2024 exams both included questions on spinal reflexes. In 2024, 64% of students scored zero on a question about the somatic nervous system and spinal cord's roles in a reflex because they provided generic definitions without connecting them to the specific scenario described in the question. Remember the golden rule: **always link your answer to the scenario**. If the question describes a person touching a hot pan, your answer must reference the hot pan, the hand, and the specific muscles involved — not just define "sensory neuron" and "motor neuron" in the abstract.

# 3. Neuron Structure and Synaptic Transmission

## 3.1 The Structure of a Neuron

A **neuron** (nerve cell) is the fundamental unit of the nervous system. Although neurons come in different shapes and sizes depending on their function, they share a common basic structure:

**Dendrites** are short, branching extensions that **receive** signals from other neurons or sensory receptors. A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites, allowing it to receive input from many sources simultaneously.

**The soma (cell body)** contains the **nucleus** and is the neuron's metabolic centre. It integrates all incoming signals from the dendrites and determines whether the combined input is sufficient to generate an action potential.

**The axon** is a single, long, tube-like extension that transmits electrical impulses **away from** the soma toward the next neuron or target cell. Axons can range from less than a millimetre to over a metre in length (such as the motor neurons running from the spinal cord to the toes).

**The myelin sheath** is a white, fatty insulating layer that wraps around the axon in segments. It serves two critical functions: it **speeds up** the transmission of electrical impulses by enabling saltatory conduction (the impulse "jumps" between gaps rather than travelling continuously), and it **protects** the signal from degradation or interference.

**Nodes of Ranvier** are the small gaps between segments of the myelin sheath. The action potential "jumps" from node to node — a process called **saltatory conduction** — which is far faster than continuous conduction along an unmyelinated axon.

**Terminal buttons (axon terminals)** are the enlarged endpoints of the axon's branches. They contain **synaptic vesicles** — small sacs that store **neurotransmitters** (the chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons).

### A Fundamental Principle

Communication **within** a neuron is **electrical** — the action potential (a brief electrical impulse) travels along the axon. Communication **between** neurons is **chemical** — neurotransmitters carry the signal across the gap between neurons. Neural information travels in **one direction only**: dendrites → soma → axon → terminal buttons → synapse → next neuron's dendrites.

## 3.2 Synaptic Transmission: How Neurons Communicate

The **synapse** (or synaptic cleft) is the tiny gap between the terminal button of one neuron (the **presynaptic neuron**) and the dendrite of the next neuron (the **postsynaptic neuron**). Neurons do not physically touch each other — the synapse is a fluid-filled space approximately 20 nanometres wide.

The process of **synaptic transmission** occurs in a precise sequence:

1. An **action potential** arrives at the presynaptic terminal button
2. The arrival of the action potential causes **calcium ion channels** to open; calcium ions flood into the terminal
3. The influx of calcium triggers **synaptic vesicles** to move toward and **fuse** with the presynaptic membrane
4. **Neurotransmitters** are released from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft via a process called **exocytosis**
5. The neurotransmitters **diffuse** across the synaptic cleft
6. The neurotransmitters **bind** to **complementary receptor sites** on the postsynaptic neuron's dendrite — this is called the **lock-and-key process**, because each neurotransmitter has a specific molecular shape that must match the shape of the receptor (like a key fitting into a lock)
7. The binding triggers either an **excitatory** or **inhibitory** effect on the postsynaptic neuron (explained in the next section)
8. The remaining neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft are cleared by one of three mechanisms: **reuptake** (absorbed back into the presynaptic terminal for recycling), **enzymatic degradation** (broken down by enzymes in the cleft), or **diffusion** (drifting away from the synapse)

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The VCAA examiners consistently reward precise, technical language in synaptic transmission responses. Compare these two answers to a question asking how a neural signal crosses a synapse:
>
> **Weak answer (1/3 marks):** "The message goes across the gap between the neurons using chemicals."
>
> **Strong answer (3/3 marks):** "The neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic terminal button into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis. It diffuses across the cleft and binds to complementary receptor sites on the postsynaptic neuron's dendrite via the lock-and-key process, producing either an excitatory or inhibitory effect."
>
> The difference is terminology. Both answers describe the same process, but the strong answer uses the precise terms the examiners are looking for.

# 4. Neurotransmitters: Glutamate and GABA

## 4.1 Excitatory and Inhibitory Effects

When a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces one of two effects:

An **Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP)** makes the postsynaptic neuron **more likely to fire** an action potential. It does this by causing a small **depolarisation** — a shift in the neuron's electrical charge toward the threshold needed to trigger an action potential.

An **Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP)** makes the postsynaptic neuron **less likely to fire** an action potential. It does this by causing a **hyperpolarisation** — a shift in the neuron's electrical charge further away from the threshold.

Whether a neurotransmitter produces an EPSP or IPSP depends on both the neurotransmitter itself and the type of receptor it binds to on the postsynaptic neuron.

## 4.2 Glutamate: The Primary Excitatory Neurotransmitter

**Glutamate** is the brain's **most common excitatory neurotransmitter**, responsible for approximately 75% of all excitatory transmission in the brain. When glutamate binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces an **EPSP**, making that neuron more likely to fire.

Glutamate is essential for:

- **Learning and memory formation** — it is the neurotransmitter most directly involved in synaptic plasticity
- **Cognitive functions** including attention, problem-solving, and information processing
- **Long-term potentiation (LTP)** — glutamate activates NMDA receptors, which are fundamental to the strengthening of synaptic connections (covered in Section 5)

When glutamate levels are abnormally high, excess stimulation can damage and destroy neurons — a process called **excitotoxicity**. This mechanism has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

## 4.3 GABA: The Primary Inhibitory Neurotransmitter

**GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid)** is the brain's **most common inhibitory neurotransmitter**, present at approximately 30–40% of all synapses. When GABA binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces an **IPSP**, making that neuron less likely to fire.

GABA plays a critical regulatory role in:

- **Preventing neural overexcitation** — without GABA, neurons would fire uncontrollably, potentially causing seizures
- **Managing anxiety** — adequate GABA levels help regulate the amygdala's fear response
- **Promoting sleep** — GABA inhibits wakefulness-promoting circuits
- **Concentration and focus** — by suppressing irrelevant neural activity

An important biological fact: GABA is actually **synthesised from glutamate**. The two neurotransmitters are chemically related — glutamate is converted to GABA by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). This means the brain's most important excitatory chemical is the direct precursor of its most important inhibitory chemical — an elegant balance.

**Low GABA levels** are associated with anxiety disorders, insomnia, and epilepsy. This has clinical significance: **benzodiazepines** (a class of medication used to treat anxiety) work by enhancing GABA's inhibitory effects at the synapse, effectively increasing its calming influence on neural activity. You will encounter benzodiazepines again in Unit 4 when studying the treatment of specific phobia.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The relationship between GABA and anxiety/phobia has been directly examined in both 2023 (SA Q7d, 5 marks — benzodiazepines as GABA agonists) and 2024 (MC Q40 — GABA dysfunction in phobias). Students need to be able to explain the three-step chain: **insufficient GABA → unregulated neural activity in the amygdala → heightened, persistent fear response**. This chain connects U3 AOS1 (neurotransmitters) directly to Unit 4 AOS2 (biopsychosocial contributing factors to specific phobia).

## 4.4 Summation: How the Postsynaptic Neuron "Decides"

A single EPSP is usually too weak to trigger an action potential on its own. At any given moment, the postsynaptic neuron is receiving inputs from hundreds or thousands of other neurons simultaneously — some excitatory (EPSPs) and some inhibitory (IPSPs).

**Summation** is the process by which the postsynaptic neuron integrates all incoming EPSPs and IPSPs. If the total excitatory input exceeds the total inhibitory input by enough to reach the neuron's **threshold**, an action potential fires. If it does not reach threshold, no action potential occurs.

This is called the **all-or-none principle**: an action potential either fires at full strength or does not fire at all. There is no partial action potential — it is like a light switch, not a dimmer.

# 5. Synaptic Plasticity: LTP, LTD, and Neural Modifications

## 5.1 What Is Synaptic Plasticity?

**Synaptic plasticity** is the ability of synaptic connections between neurons to **strengthen or weaken over time in response to experience**. It is the fundamental neural mechanism underlying learning and memory — when you learn something new, the physical connections between neurons in your brain change.

The two key mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation (strengthening) and long-term depression (weakening). Together, they allow the brain to adapt, form new memories, refine skills, and discard unused information.

## 5.2 Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)

**Long-term potentiation (LTP)** is the **long-lasting strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons that are frequently co-activated due to repeated stimulation**.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert — Critical Definition:** The 2024 examiner report explicitly flagged that students consistently omit the requirement for "repeated stimulation" when defining LTP. In 2024, 46% of students scored zero on a question about LTP. The complete definition must include: (1) long-lasting, (2) strengthening of a synapse, (3) due to repeated stimulation. Writing "LTP is the strengthening of a synapse" is **incomplete** and may not earn full marks. Always include "due to repeated stimulation."

The principle behind LTP is captured by **Hebb's Rule (1949)**: "Cells that fire together, wire together." When two neurons are repeatedly activated at the same time, the synaptic connection between them becomes progressively stronger and more efficient.

At the cellular level, LTP works like this: with repeated stimulation, the presynaptic neuron releases **more glutamate** into the synapse, and the postsynaptic neuron develops **more receptor sites** on its dendrites. This makes the pathway easier to activate — a smaller input can now produce a larger response. Specifically, LTP involves the activation of **NMDA receptors** (a type of glutamate receptor) and the subsequent addition of **AMPA receptors** to the postsynaptic membrane, which enhances signal reception.

A standard analogy used in VCE classrooms compares LTP to walking a path through long grass. The first time you walk through, it is difficult — the grass is tall and the path is unclear. But the more often you walk the same route, the more the grass is flattened and the path becomes established. Eventually, the path is so well-worn that walking it requires almost no effort. Similarly, the more frequently a neural pathway is activated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes.

### Research in Focus: Bliss and Lømo (1973) — The Discovery of LTP

The existence of LTP was first demonstrated experimentally by Timothy Bliss and Terje Lømo in 1973 at the University of Oslo. Working with anaesthetised rabbits, they placed stimulating electrodes on the **perforant pathway** in the hippocampus and recording electrodes on neurons in the **dentate gyrus**.

They delivered a brief burst of high-frequency electrical stimulation and then measured the response of the postsynaptic neurons. They found that after the high-frequency stimulation, the synaptic response was significantly and rapidly enhanced — the postsynaptic neurons produced **larger EPSPs** that **rose more quickly**. Remarkably, this enhancement was long-lasting: it persisted for hours in brain slices and for days to weeks in intact animals.

This was the first experimental demonstration that synapses in the mammalian brain could undergo lasting strengthening, providing cellular-level evidence for the theoretical framework that Hebb had proposed 24 years earlier. Bliss and Lømo's work is foundational to our understanding of how the brain encodes learning and memory at the synaptic level.

### Research in Focus: Maguire et al. (2000) — London Taxi Drivers

Eleanor Maguire and colleagues at University College London used MRI scanning to compare the brains of licensed London taxi drivers with control participants. London taxi drivers must pass "The Knowledge" — a gruelling qualification requiring memorisation of approximately 25,000 streets and thousands of landmarks across London, typically taking 3–4 years to complete.

Maguire found that taxi drivers had significantly **larger posterior hippocampi** (the region of the hippocampus involved in spatial memory and navigation) compared to controls. Furthermore, the volume of the posterior hippocampus was **positively correlated with years of experience** as a taxi driver — the longer they had been driving, the larger this brain region was.

A 2011 longitudinal follow-up study (Woollett & Maguire) strengthened these findings by tracking individual trainee drivers over 3–4 years, finding that those who successfully qualified showed hippocampal growth compared to their pre-training scans and to trainees who dropped out.

This research powerfully illustrates LTP, sprouting, and adaptive plasticity in humans: intensive, repeated learning produces measurable, lasting structural changes in the brain. It is the most commonly cited example of neuroplasticity in VCE Psychology.

## 5.3 Long-Term Depression (LTD)

**Long-term depression (LTD)** is the **long-lasting weakening of synaptic connections that are not regularly activated**, resulting from lack of stimulation or prolonged low-level stimulation.

When a synaptic pathway is rarely used, the postsynaptic neuron becomes **less responsive** — AMPA receptors are removed from the postsynaptic membrane, reducing the neuron's sensitivity to glutamate. The connection weakens, making it harder to activate. Eventually, unused connections may be eliminated entirely (pruning — see Section 5.4).

LTD is often overlooked by students, but it is **equally important** to learning as LTP. Without LTD, the brain would become overloaded with unnecessary connections. LTD clears unused pathways and refines neural networks, allowing the brain to operate efficiently and allocate resources to the connections that matter most.

The standard analogy is the reverse of the LTP path analogy: a path through long grass that stops being used will gradually become overgrown until it is no longer navigable.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The term "depression" in LTD refers to **reduced neural activity** at the synapse — not the mental health condition. This is a common source of confusion. If a question asks about LTD, your answer should be about weakened synaptic connections, not about mood or psychological distress.

## 5.4 Neural Modifications: Sprouting, Rerouting, and Pruning

LTP and LTD together drive three types of structural modification in neural networks:

### Sprouting

**Sprouting** is the growth of **new dendritic or axonal branches** to form new synaptic connections. It occurs when neural pathways are frequently activated (via LTP), stimulating the neuron to grow additional branches that create connections with neighbouring neurons.

**Analogy:** A tree growing new branches in the direction of sunlight — it extends toward the resources it needs.

**Example:** When you learn a new skill like playing piano, the repeated practice strengthens existing neural pathways (LTP) and stimulates the growth of new connections (sprouting) between the motor cortex, cerebellum, and auditory cortex. Over time, a dense network of connections forms, supporting fluid, coordinated performance.

### Rerouting

**Rerouting** is the redirection of existing neural connections to create **alternative pathways**, often around damaged or dysfunctional neurons. This is a key mechanism of recovery after brain injury.

**Analogy:** When a road is flooded, traffic is redirected via a detour to reach the same destination by a different route.

**Example:** After a stroke damages neurons in the motor cortex controlling the right hand, surviving neurons may form new connections that partially restore hand function — the signals find alternative routes to reach the same muscles.

### Pruning

**Pruning** is the elimination of **weak, unused synaptic connections**. It is driven by LTD — connections that are not regularly activated weaken progressively until they are removed entirely.

**Analogy:** Trimming dead or unproductive branches from a tree so that the remaining branches receive maximum nutrients and grow more strongly.

**Example:** Infants are born with far more synaptic connections than adults. During childhood and adolescence, the brain undergoes extensive pruning — eliminating connections that are not reinforced by experience while strengthening those that are. This is why early experiences are so influential in shaping brain development. The principle is sometimes summarised as "use it or lose it."

Pruning is not negative — it is essential for efficient brain function. A pruned, refined neural network operates faster and more efficiently than an overgrown, unfocused one.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** When discussing sprouting, rerouting, and pruning in exam responses, always connect them to either LTP or LTD. Sprouting and rerouting result from **LTP** (strengthening and growth). Pruning results from **LTD** (weakening and elimination). Simply listing the three modifications without explaining their relationship to LTP/LTD will cost you marks on questions that ask you to explain how synaptic plasticity modifies neural connections.

# 6. Bringing It All Together: How the Nervous System Enables Psychological Functioning

The content in this chapter is not a set of isolated facts — it forms an integrated system. Understanding how the parts connect is essential for high-level exam responses.

The **nervous system hierarchy** (Section 1) tells you which structures are responsible for different types of responses. The **neuron and synaptic transmission** (Sections 3–4) tells you how signals are communicated within and between these structures. **Synaptic plasticity** (Section 5) tells you how these communication pathways change with experience, enabling learning and memory.

When a VCAA exam question gives you a scenario — say, a person learning to drive a car — you should be able to trace the process through multiple levels:

- The somatic NS carries sensory information (visual, auditory, tactile) to the CNS for processing
- The brain's motor cortex generates voluntary commands transmitted via motor neurons to skeletal muscles
- The ANS regulates involuntary responses (heart rate increasing during stressful traffic situations)
- With practice, the neural pathways involved in driving are strengthened through LTP — glutamate release increases, more receptor sites develop, and the pathways become easier to activate
- Sprouting creates new connections between relevant brain regions
- Pathways for incorrect or unnecessary responses weaken through LTD and are eventually pruned
- Eventually, many driving actions become near-automatic — the pathways are so well-established that conscious effort is minimal

This kind of integrated, multi-level response is what earns top marks on extended-answer questions.

LEARNING POINT CONTEXT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TITLE: I can explain long-term depression (LTD) as a long-lasting weakening of synapses due to lack of stimulation
CODE: 5.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
LTD is the long-lasting weakening of synaptic connections that are not regularly activated, resulting from lack of stimulation or prolonged low-level stimulation. AMPA receptors are removed from the postsynaptic membrane, reducing the neuron's sensitivity to glutamate. The connection becomes harder to activate.

WHY (importance):
LTD is equally important to learning as LTP. Without LTD, the brain would become overloaded with unnecessary connections. LTD clears unused pathways and allows the brain to allocate resources efficiently. Note that 'depression' here refers to reduced neural activity, not the mental health condition.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A person who was fluent in French as a child but has not spoken or practised French for 15 years finds it much harder to recall vocabulary and grammar. The neural pathways for French have weakened through LTD due to lack of regular activation.

SUBTOPIC: Synaptic Plasticity: LTP and LTD
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers synaptic plasticity as the brain's ability to strengthen or weaken synaptic connections in response to experience, including the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).

# Why It Matters

Right now, as you read this sentence, your nervous system is doing something remarkable. Your eyes are converting light into electrical signals. Those signals are racing along neurons to your brain at speeds up to 120 metres per second. Your brain is decoding the patterns into letters, words, and meaning. Meanwhile — without any conscious effort on your part — your heart is beating, your lungs are breathing, your stomach is digesting, and your body temperature is being regulated.

The nervous system is the body's command and communication network. It enables every thought, every movement, every sensation, and every emotion you experience. Understanding how it works is not just the foundation for this Area of Study — it underpins almost everything else you will study in VCE Psychology. The stress response (Chapter 2), learning and memory (AOS2), sleep (Unit 4), and even the development of mental health conditions like specific phobia all depend on the nervous system concepts you will learn in this chapter.

This is also one of the most heavily examined topics in VCE Psychology. In the 2023 and 2024 exams (the first two under this study design), nervous system questions appeared in both multiple-choice and short-answer sections every year. The good news is that much of this content is straightforward once you understand the hierarchy and the key processes. The challenge — and where marks are most commonly lost — is applying your knowledge to scenarios you have never seen before. This chapter will teach you both the content and how to use it under exam conditions.

# 1. The Nervous System Hierarchy

## 1.1 An Overview: Two Major Subdivisions

The human **nervous system** is divided into two major subdivisions based on location:

The **Central Nervous System (CNS)** consists of the **brain** and the **spinal cord**. It is the processing and coordination centre of the entire nervous system. The brain interprets sensory information, generates thoughts and emotions, stores memories, and initiates voluntary movements. The spinal cord serves as the information highway between the brain and the rest of the body, and it can also coordinate some responses independently (spinal reflexes — more on this shortly).

The **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)** consists of all the nerves and neurons that exist **outside** the brain and spinal cord. Its role is to connect the CNS to every organ, muscle, gland, and sensory receptor in the body. Think of it as the network of roads linking a central command centre (the CNS) to every part of a city (the body).

## 1.2 Subdivisions of the Peripheral Nervous System

The PNS itself divides into two functional systems:

### The Somatic Nervous System

The **somatic nervous system** controls **voluntary** movements of skeletal muscles and carries sensory information from the body to the CNS. It operates through two types of neural pathways:

**Sensory (afferent) neurons** carry information **toward** the CNS — from sensory receptors in the skin, eyes, ears, and other organs to the brain or spinal cord for processing. The word "afferent" comes from the Latin *ad* (toward) and *ferre* (to carry).

**Motor (efferent) neurons** carry commands **away from** the CNS — from the brain or spinal cord to skeletal muscles, producing voluntary movements. The word "efferent" comes from the Latin *ex* (away from) and *ferre* (to carry).

A helpful mnemonic is **SAME**: **S**ensory = **A**fferent, **M**otor = **E**fferent.

**Interneurons** are the third neuron type. They exist only within the CNS (brain and spinal cord) and relay signals between sensory and motor neurons. They are critical for processing, integration, and decision-making within the CNS.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The VCAA examiners have noted in both 2023 and 2024 that students frequently say neurons "travel" to the brain. Neurons do not travel anywhere — they are fixed in place. **Neural information** (electrical impulses and chemical signals) travels **along** neurons. This distinction matters for marks on neural pathway and spinal reflex questions.

### The Autonomic Nervous System

The **autonomic nervous system (ANS)** controls **involuntary** functions — processes that occur automatically without conscious effort, such as heart rate, breathing, digestion, and gland secretion. The ANS has three subdivisions:

**The sympathetic nervous system** prepares the body for vigorous activity or threat response. When dominant, it produces the physiological changes associated with arousal: increased heart rate and blood pressure, bronchiole dilation (for more oxygen intake), pupil dilation, blood redistribution from the digestive system to skeletal muscles, increased sweating, and glucose mobilisation for energy. The sympathetic division is dominant during the fight-or-flight response.

**The parasympathetic nervous system** restores the body to a calm, resting state after sympathetic activation. When dominant, it slows heart rate, constricts pupils, stimulates digestion, and promotes energy conservation. This is sometimes called the "rest and digest" system. Critically, the parasympathetic division is also dominant during the **freeze** response — a point we will return to in Chapter 2.

**The enteric nervous system (ENS)** is a mesh-like network of neurons embedded in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract. Often called the "second brain," it is capable of semi-autonomous function — it can regulate digestion and gut motility independently of the brain, although it communicates with the CNS via the vagus nerve. The ENS is central to the **gut-brain axis**, which you will study in Chapter 2.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** A very common error is treating the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions as an on/off switch — as if one is completely "on" while the other is completely "off." In reality, both operate simultaneously at all times. One is merely **dominant** at any given time. For example, even during intense sympathetic activation (such as running from danger), the parasympathetic division is still active at a low level. This is the concept of **autonomic dominance**, and using this precise language in your exam responses demonstrates sophisticated understanding.

### Standard Diagram: The Nervous System Hierarchy

The standard VCE flowchart for the nervous system hierarchy appears in every major textbook (Jacaranda 8th ed., Edrolo, Nelson) and is frequently the basis for exam questions. You should be able to draw this from memory:

```

                       (Afferent)(Efferent)  NS    NS    NS
```

# 2. Conscious and Unconscious Responses

## 2.1 Conscious Responses

A **conscious response** involves **awareness** and is typically **voluntary**. It always involves the **cerebral cortex** (the outer layer of the brain responsible for higher-order thinking). The pathway is:

1. Sensory receptor detects a stimulus (e.g. you see a ball flying toward you)
2. Sensory (afferent) neurons carry the signal via the PNS to the CNS
3. The brain (specifically the cerebral cortex) processes and interprets the information
4. The brain generates a deliberate response
5. Motor (efferent) neurons carry the command from the CNS via the PNS to skeletal muscles
6. The voluntary movement occurs (e.g. you raise your hands to catch the ball)

## 2.2 Unconscious Responses

An **unconscious response** occurs **without awareness** and is **involuntary**. However — and this is where many students make errors — there are **two different types** of unconscious response, and they involve different nervous system structures:

### Type 1: Autonomic Responses

Autonomic responses such as heart rate regulation, breathing, and digestion are unconscious and involuntary. However, they **still involve the brain** — specifically the **brainstem**, which sits at the base of the brain and connects it to the spinal cord. The brainstem contains centres that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and other vital functions.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** In 2023, 55% of students answered a multiple-choice question incorrectly because they believed all unconscious responses bypass the brain. The VCAA examiner report explicitly clarified: "Unconscious responses of the autonomic nervous system, such as heart rate and breathing, require the involvement of both the brain (brainstem) and spinal cord." Only **spinal reflexes** bypass the brain initially.

### Type 2: Spinal Reflexes

A **spinal reflex** is a rapid, involuntary response that is initiated at the spinal cord **without the brain's involvement initially**. The response occurs before the brain even receives the sensory information. The classic example is the withdrawal reflex — pulling your hand away from a hot surface before you consciously feel the pain.

The **spinal reflex arc** follows this sequence:

1. A **sensory receptor** in the skin detects the stimulus (e.g. extreme heat)
2. A **sensory (afferent) neuron** carries the signal to the spinal cord
3. An **interneuron** in the spinal cord relays the signal directly to a motor neuron
4. A **motor (efferent) neuron** carries the command to the relevant muscle
5. The muscle contracts, producing the withdrawal response (e.g. pulling your hand away)
6. **Simultaneously**, the sensory signal ascends to the brain via the spinal cord — but by the time the brain processes the pain, the reflex has already occurred

The biological advantage of spinal reflexes is **speed**. By bypassing the brain's processing time, the body can respond to threats in as little as 20–50 milliseconds — far faster than a conscious response, which might take 150–300 milliseconds. This can be the difference between a minor burn and a severe injury.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The 2023 and 2024 exams both included questions on spinal reflexes. In 2024, 64% of students scored zero on a question about the somatic nervous system and spinal cord's roles in a reflex because they provided generic definitions without connecting them to the specific scenario described in the question. Remember the golden rule: **always link your answer to the scenario**. If the question describes a person touching a hot pan, your answer must reference the hot pan, the hand, and the specific muscles involved — not just define "sensory neuron" and "motor neuron" in the abstract.

# 3. Neuron Structure and Synaptic Transmission

## 3.1 The Structure of a Neuron

A **neuron** (nerve cell) is the fundamental unit of the nervous system. Although neurons come in different shapes and sizes depending on their function, they share a common basic structure:

**Dendrites** are short, branching extensions that **receive** signals from other neurons or sensory receptors. A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites, allowing it to receive input from many sources simultaneously.

**The soma (cell body)** contains the **nucleus** and is the neuron's metabolic centre. It integrates all incoming signals from the dendrites and determines whether the combined input is sufficient to generate an action potential.

**The axon** is a single, long, tube-like extension that transmits electrical impulses **away from** the soma toward the next neuron or target cell. Axons can range from less than a millimetre to over a metre in length (such as the motor neurons running from the spinal cord to the toes).

**The myelin sheath** is a white, fatty insulating layer that wraps around the axon in segments. It serves two critical functions: it **speeds up** the transmission of electrical impulses by enabling saltatory conduction (the impulse "jumps" between gaps rather than travelling continuously), and it **protects** the signal from degradation or interference.

**Nodes of Ranvier** are the small gaps between segments of the myelin sheath. The action potential "jumps" from node to node — a process called **saltatory conduction** — which is far faster than continuous conduction along an unmyelinated axon.

**Terminal buttons (axon terminals)** are the enlarged endpoints of the axon's branches. They contain **synaptic vesicles** — small sacs that store **neurotransmitters** (the chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons).

### A Fundamental Principle

Communication **within** a neuron is **electrical** — the action potential (a brief electrical impulse) travels along the axon. Communication **between** neurons is **chemical** — neurotransmitters carry the signal across the gap between neurons. Neural information travels in **one direction only**: dendrites → soma → axon → terminal buttons → synapse → next neuron's dendrites.

## 3.2 Synaptic Transmission: How Neurons Communicate

The **synapse** (or synaptic cleft) is the tiny gap between the terminal button of one neuron (the **presynaptic neuron**) and the dendrite of the next neuron (the **postsynaptic neuron**). Neurons do not physically touch each other — the synapse is a fluid-filled space approximately 20 nanometres wide.

The process of **synaptic transmission** occurs in a precise sequence:

1. An **action potential** arrives at the presynaptic terminal button
2. The arrival of the action potential causes **calcium ion channels** to open; calcium ions flood into the terminal
3. The influx of calcium triggers **synaptic vesicles** to move toward and **fuse** with the presynaptic membrane
4. **Neurotransmitters** are released from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft via a process called **exocytosis**
5. The neurotransmitters **diffuse** across the synaptic cleft
6. The neurotransmitters **bind** to **complementary receptor sites** on the postsynaptic neuron's dendrite — this is called the **lock-and-key process**, because each neurotransmitter has a specific molecular shape that must match the shape of the receptor (like a key fitting into a lock)
7. The binding triggers either an **excitatory** or **inhibitory** effect on the postsynaptic neuron (explained in the next section)
8. The remaining neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft are cleared by one of three mechanisms: **reuptake** (absorbed back into the presynaptic terminal for recycling), **enzymatic degradation** (broken down by enzymes in the cleft), or **diffusion** (drifting away from the synapse)

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The VCAA examiners consistently reward precise, technical language in synaptic transmission responses. Compare these two answers to a question asking how a neural signal crosses a synapse:
>
> **Weak answer (1/3 marks):** "The message goes across the gap between the neurons using chemicals."
>
> **Strong answer (3/3 marks):** "The neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic terminal button into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis. It diffuses across the cleft and binds to complementary receptor sites on the postsynaptic neuron's dendrite via the lock-and-key process, producing either an excitatory or inhibitory effect."
>
> The difference is terminology. Both answers describe the same process, but the strong answer uses the precise terms the examiners are looking for.

# 4. Neurotransmitters: Glutamate and GABA

## 4.1 Excitatory and Inhibitory Effects

When a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces one of two effects:

An **Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP)** makes the postsynaptic neuron **more likely to fire** an action potential. It does this by causing a small **depolarisation** — a shift in the neuron's electrical charge toward the threshold needed to trigger an action potential.

An **Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP)** makes the postsynaptic neuron **less likely to fire** an action potential. It does this by causing a **hyperpolarisation** — a shift in the neuron's electrical charge further away from the threshold.

Whether a neurotransmitter produces an EPSP or IPSP depends on both the neurotransmitter itself and the type of receptor it binds to on the postsynaptic neuron.

## 4.2 Glutamate: The Primary Excitatory Neurotransmitter

**Glutamate** is the brain's **most common excitatory neurotransmitter**, responsible for approximately 75% of all excitatory transmission in the brain. When glutamate binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces an **EPSP**, making that neuron more likely to fire.

Glutamate is essential for:

- **Learning and memory formation** — it is the neurotransmitter most directly involved in synaptic plasticity
- **Cognitive functions** including attention, problem-solving, and information processing
- **Long-term potentiation (LTP)** — glutamate activates NMDA receptors, which are fundamental to the strengthening of synaptic connections (covered in Section 5)

When glutamate levels are abnormally high, excess stimulation can damage and destroy neurons — a process called **excitotoxicity**. This mechanism has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

## 4.3 GABA: The Primary Inhibitory Neurotransmitter

**GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid)** is the brain's **most common inhibitory neurotransmitter**, present at approximately 30–40% of all synapses. When GABA binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces an **IPSP**, making that neuron less likely to fire.

GABA plays a critical regulatory role in:

- **Preventing neural overexcitation** — without GABA, neurons would fire uncontrollably, potentially causing seizures
- **Managing anxiety** — adequate GABA levels help regulate the amygdala's fear response
- **Promoting sleep** — GABA inhibits wakefulness-promoting circuits
- **Concentration and focus** — by suppressing irrelevant neural activity

An important biological fact: GABA is actually **synthesised from glutamate**. The two neurotransmitters are chemically related — glutamate is converted to GABA by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). This means the brain's most important excitatory chemical is the direct precursor of its most important inhibitory chemical — an elegant balance.

**Low GABA levels** are associated with anxiety disorders, insomnia, and epilepsy. This has clinical significance: **benzodiazepines** (a class of medication used to treat anxiety) work by enhancing GABA's inhibitory effects at the synapse, effectively increasing its calming influence on neural activity. You will encounter benzodiazepines again in Unit 4 when studying the treatment of specific phobia.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The relationship between GABA and anxiety/phobia has been directly examined in both 2023 (SA Q7d, 5 marks — benzodiazepines as GABA agonists) and 2024 (MC Q40 — GABA dysfunction in phobias). Students need to be able to explain the three-step chain: **insufficient GABA → unregulated neural activity in the amygdala → heightened, persistent fear response**. This chain connects U3 AOS1 (neurotransmitters) directly to Unit 4 AOS2 (biopsychosocial contributing factors to specific phobia).

## 4.4 Summation: How the Postsynaptic Neuron "Decides"

A single EPSP is usually too weak to trigger an action potential on its own. At any given moment, the postsynaptic neuron is receiving inputs from hundreds or thousands of other neurons simultaneously — some excitatory (EPSPs) and some inhibitory (IPSPs).

**Summation** is the process by which the postsynaptic neuron integrates all incoming EPSPs and IPSPs. If the total excitatory input exceeds the total inhibitory input by enough to reach the neuron's **threshold**, an action potential fires. If it does not reach threshold, no action potential occurs.

This is called the **all-or-none principle**: an action potential either fires at full strength or does not fire at all. There is no partial action potential — it is like a light switch, not a dimmer.

# 5. Synaptic Plasticity: LTP, LTD, and Neural Modifications

## 5.1 What Is Synaptic Plasticity?

**Synaptic plasticity** is the ability of synaptic connections between neurons to **strengthen or weaken over time in response to experience**. It is the fundamental neural mechanism underlying learning and memory — when you learn something new, the physical connections between neurons in your brain change.

The two key mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation (strengthening) and long-term depression (weakening). Together, they allow the brain to adapt, form new memories, refine skills, and discard unused information.

## 5.2 Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)

**Long-term potentiation (LTP)** is the **long-lasting strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons that are frequently co-activated due to repeated stimulation**.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert — Critical Definition:** The 2024 examiner report explicitly flagged that students consistently omit the requirement for "repeated stimulation" when defining LTP. In 2024, 46% of students scored zero on a question about LTP. The complete definition must include: (1) long-lasting, (2) strengthening of a synapse, (3) due to repeated stimulation. Writing "LTP is the strengthening of a synapse" is **incomplete** and may not earn full marks. Always include "due to repeated stimulation."

The principle behind LTP is captured by **Hebb's Rule (1949)**: "Cells that fire together, wire together." When two neurons are repeatedly activated at the same time, the synaptic connection between them becomes progressively stronger and more efficient.

At the cellular level, LTP works like this: with repeated stimulation, the presynaptic neuron releases **more glutamate** into the synapse, and the postsynaptic neuron develops **more receptor sites** on its dendrites. This makes the pathway easier to activate — a smaller input can now produce a larger response. Specifically, LTP involves the activation of **NMDA receptors** (a type of glutamate receptor) and the subsequent addition of **AMPA receptors** to the postsynaptic membrane, which enhances signal reception.

A standard analogy used in VCE classrooms compares LTP to walking a path through long grass. The first time you walk through, it is difficult — the grass is tall and the path is unclear. But the more often you walk the same route, the more the grass is flattened and the path becomes established. Eventually, the path is so well-worn that walking it requires almost no effort. Similarly, the more frequently a neural pathway is activated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes.

### Research in Focus: Bliss and Lømo (1973) — The Discovery of LTP

The existence of LTP was first demonstrated experimentally by Timothy Bliss and Terje Lømo in 1973 at the University of Oslo. Working with anaesthetised rabbits, they placed stimulating electrodes on the **perforant pathway** in the hippocampus and recording electrodes on neurons in the **dentate gyrus**.

They delivered a brief burst of high-frequency electrical stimulation and then measured the response of the postsynaptic neurons. They found that after the high-frequency stimulation, the synaptic response was significantly and rapidly enhanced — the postsynaptic neurons produced **larger EPSPs** that **rose more quickly**. Remarkably, this enhancement was long-lasting: it persisted for hours in brain slices and for days to weeks in intact animals.

This was the first experimental demonstration that synapses in the mammalian brain could undergo lasting strengthening, providing cellular-level evidence for the theoretical framework that Hebb had proposed 24 years earlier. Bliss and Lømo's work is foundational to our understanding of how the brain encodes learning and memory at the synaptic level.

### Research in Focus: Maguire et al. (2000) — London Taxi Drivers

Eleanor Maguire and colleagues at University College London used MRI scanning to compare the brains of licensed London taxi drivers with control participants. London taxi drivers must pass "The Knowledge" — a gruelling qualification requiring memorisation of approximately 25,000 streets and thousands of landmarks across London, typically taking 3–4 years to complete.

Maguire found that taxi drivers had significantly **larger posterior hippocampi** (the region of the hippocampus involved in spatial memory and navigation) compared to controls. Furthermore, the volume of the posterior hippocampus was **positively correlated with years of experience** as a taxi driver — the longer they had been driving, the larger this brain region was.

A 2011 longitudinal follow-up study (Woollett & Maguire) strengthened these findings by tracking individual trainee drivers over 3–4 years, finding that those who successfully qualified showed hippocampal growth compared to their pre-training scans and to trainees who dropped out.

This research powerfully illustrates LTP, sprouting, and adaptive plasticity in humans: intensive, repeated learning produces measurable, lasting structural changes in the brain. It is the most commonly cited example of neuroplasticity in VCE Psychology.

## 5.3 Long-Term Depression (LTD)

**Long-term depression (LTD)** is the **long-lasting weakening of synaptic connections that are not regularly activated**, resulting from lack of stimulation or prolonged low-level stimulation.

When a synaptic pathway is rarely used, the postsynaptic neuron becomes **less responsive** — AMPA receptors are removed from the postsynaptic membrane, reducing the neuron's sensitivity to glutamate. The connection weakens, making it harder to activate. Eventually, unused connections may be eliminated entirely (pruning — see Section 5.4).

LTD is often overlooked by students, but it is **equally important** to learning as LTP. Without LTD, the brain would become overloaded with unnecessary connections. LTD clears unused pathways and refines neural networks, allowing the brain to operate efficiently and allocate resources to the connections that matter most.

The standard analogy is the reverse of the LTP path analogy: a path through long grass that stops being used will gradually become overgrown until it is no longer navigable.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The term "depression" in LTD refers to **reduced neural activity** at the synapse — not the mental health condition. This is a common source of confusion. If a question asks about LTD, your answer should be about weakened synaptic connections, not about mood or psychological distress.

## 5.4 Neural Modifications: Sprouting, Rerouting, and Pruning

LTP and LTD together drive three types of structural modification in neural networks:

### Sprouting

**Sprouting** is the growth of **new dendritic or axonal branches** to form new synaptic connections. It occurs when neural pathways are frequently activated (via LTP), stimulating the neuron to grow additional branches that create connections with neighbouring neurons.

**Analogy:** A tree growing new branches in the direction of sunlight — it extends toward the resources it needs.

**Example:** When you learn a new skill like playing piano, the repeated practice strengthens existing neural pathways (LTP) and stimulates the growth of new connections (sprouting) between the motor cortex, cerebellum, and auditory cortex. Over time, a dense network of connections forms, supporting fluid, coordinated performance.

### Rerouting

**Rerouting** is the redirection of existing neural connections to create **alternative pathways**, often around damaged or dysfunctional neurons. This is a key mechanism of recovery after brain injury.

**Analogy:** When a road is flooded, traffic is redirected via a detour to reach the same destination by a different route.

**Example:** After a stroke damages neurons in the motor cortex controlling the right hand, surviving neurons may form new connections that partially restore hand function — the signals find alternative routes to reach the same muscles.

### Pruning

**Pruning** is the elimination of **weak, unused synaptic connections**. It is driven by LTD — connections that are not regularly activated weaken progressively until they are removed entirely.

**Analogy:** Trimming dead or unproductive branches from a tree so that the remaining branches receive maximum nutrients and grow more strongly.

**Example:** Infants are born with far more synaptic connections than adults. During childhood and adolescence, the brain undergoes extensive pruning — eliminating connections that are not reinforced by experience while strengthening those that are. This is why early experiences are so influential in shaping brain development. The principle is sometimes summarised as "use it or lose it."

Pruning is not negative — it is essential for efficient brain function. A pruned, refined neural network operates faster and more efficiently than an overgrown, unfocused one.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** When discussing sprouting, rerouting, and pruning in exam responses, always connect them to either LTP or LTD. Sprouting and rerouting result from **LTP** (strengthening and growth). Pruning results from **LTD** (weakening and elimination). Simply listing the three modifications without explaining their relationship to LTP/LTD will cost you marks on questions that ask you to explain how synaptic plasticity modifies neural connections.

# 6. Bringing It All Together: How the Nervous System Enables Psychological Functioning

The content in this chapter is not a set of isolated facts — it forms an integrated system. Understanding how the parts connect is essential for high-level exam responses.

The **nervous system hierarchy** (Section 1) tells you which structures are responsible for different types of responses. The **neuron and synaptic transmission** (Sections 3–4) tells you how signals are communicated within and between these structures. **Synaptic plasticity** (Section 5) tells you how these communication pathways change with experience, enabling learning and memory.

When a VCAA exam question gives you a scenario — say, a person learning to drive a car — you should be able to trace the process through multiple levels:

- The somatic NS carries sensory information (visual, auditory, tactile) to the CNS for processing
- The brain's motor cortex generates voluntary commands transmitted via motor neurons to skeletal muscles
- The ANS regulates involuntary responses (heart rate increasing during stressful traffic situations)
- With practice, the neural pathways involved in driving are strengthened through LTP — glutamate release increases, more receptor sites develop, and the pathways become easier to activate
- Sprouting creates new connections between relevant brain regions
- Pathways for incorrect or unnecessary responses weaken through LTD and are eventually pruned
- Eventually, many driving actions become near-automatic — the pathways are so well-established that conscious effort is minimal

This kind of integrated, multi-level response is what earns top marks on extended-answer questions.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

LEARNING POINT CONTEXT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TITLE: I can explain long-term depression (LTD) as a long-lasting weakening of synapses due to lack of stimulation
CODE: 5.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
LTD is the long-lasting weakening of synaptic connections that are not regularly activated, resulting from lack of stimulation or prolonged low-level stimulation. AMPA receptors are removed from the postsynaptic membrane, reducing the neuron's sensitivity to glutamate. The connection becomes harder to activate.

WHY (importance):
LTD is equally important to learning as LTP. Without LTD, the brain would become overloaded with unnecessary connections. LTD clears unused pathways and allows the brain to allocate resources efficiently. Note that 'depression' here refers to reduced neural activity, not the mental health condition.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A person who was fluent in French as a child but has not spoken or practised French for 15 years finds it much harder to recall vocabulary and grammar. The neural pathways for French have weakened through LTD due to lack of regular activation.

SUBTOPIC: Synaptic Plasticity: LTP and LTD
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers synaptic plasticity as the brain's ability to strengthen or weaken synaptic connections in response to experience, including the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Synaptic plasticity is the neural basis of learning and memory. LTP and LTD explain how the brain encodes new information, refines skills, and discards unused connections. These concepts are heavily examined and connect to almost every other topic in VCE Psychology.

TOPIC: Nervous System Functioning
SUBJECT: Psychology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The structure and function of the nervous system, including neuron communication, neurotransmitters, and synaptic plasticity as the basis for learning and memory.

# Why It Matters

Right now, as you read this sentence, your nervous system is doing something remarkable. Your eyes are converting light into electrical signals. Those signals are racing along neurons to your brain at speeds up to 120 metres per second. Your brain is decoding the patterns into letters, words, and meaning. Meanwhile — without any conscious effort on your part — your heart is beating, your lungs are breathing, your stomach is digesting, and your body temperature is being regulated.

The nervous system is the body's command and communication network. It enables every thought, every movement, every sensation, and every emotion you experience. Understanding how it works is not just the foundation for this Area of Study — it underpins almost everything else you will study in VCE Psychology. The stress response (Chapter 2), learning and memory (AOS2), sleep (Unit 4), and even the development of mental health conditions like specific phobia all depend on the nervous system concepts you will learn in this chapter.

This is also one of the most heavily examined topics in VCE Psychology. In the 2023 and 2024 exams (the first two under this study design), nervous system questions appeared in both multiple-choice and short-answer sections every year. The good news is that much of this content is straightforward once you understand the hierarchy and the key processes. The challenge — and where marks are most commonly lost — is applying your knowledge to scenarios you have never seen before. This chapter will teach you both the content and how to use it under exam conditions.

# 1. The Nervous System Hierarchy

## 1.1 An Overview: Two Major Subdivisions

The human **nervous system** is divided into two major subdivisions based on location:

The **Central Nervous System (CNS)** consists of the **brain** and the **spinal cord**. It is the processing and coordination centre of the entire nervous system. The brain interprets sensory information, generates thoughts and emotions, stores memories, and initiates voluntary movements. The spinal cord serves as the information highway between the brain and the rest of the body, and it can also coordinate some responses independently (spinal reflexes — more on this shortly).

The **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)** consists of all the nerves and neurons that exist **outside** the brain and spinal cord. Its role is to connect the CNS to every organ, muscle, gland, and sensory receptor in the body. Think of it as the network of roads linking a central command centre (the CNS) to every part of a city (the body).

## 1.2 Subdivisions of the Peripheral Nervous System

The PNS itself divides into two functional systems:

### The Somatic Nervous System

The **somatic nervous system** controls **voluntary** movements of skeletal muscles and carries sensory information from the body to the CNS. It operates through two types of neural pathways:

**Sensory (afferent) neurons** carry information **toward** the CNS — from sensory receptors in the skin, eyes, ears, and other organs to the brain or spinal cord for processing. The word "afferent" comes from the Latin *ad* (toward) and *ferre* (to carry).

**Motor (efferent) neurons** carry commands **away from** the CNS — from the brain or spinal cord to skeletal muscles, producing voluntary movements. The word "efferent" comes from the Latin *ex* (away from) and *ferre* (to carry).

A helpful mnemonic is **SAME**: **S**ensory = **A**fferent, **M**otor = **E**fferent.

**Interneurons** are the third neuron type. They exist only within the CNS (brain and spinal cord) and relay signals between sensory and motor neurons. They are critical for processing, integration, and decision-making within the CNS.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The VCAA examiners have noted in both 2023 and 2024 that students frequently say neurons "travel" to the brain. Neurons do not travel anywhere — they are fixed in place. **Neural information** (electrical impulses and chemical signals) travels **along** neurons. This distinction matters for marks on neural pathway and spinal reflex questions.

### The Autonomic Nervous System

The **autonomic nervous system (ANS)** controls **involuntary** functions — processes that occur automatically without conscious effort, such as heart rate, breathing, digestion, and gland secretion. The ANS has three subdivisions:

**The sympathetic nervous system** prepares the body for vigorous activity or threat response. When dominant, it produces the physiological changes associated with arousal: increased heart rate and blood pressure, bronchiole dilation (for more oxygen intake), pupil dilation, blood redistribution from the digestive system to skeletal muscles, increased sweating, and glucose mobilisation for energy. The sympathetic division is dominant during the fight-or-flight response.

**The parasympathetic nervous system** restores the body to a calm, resting state after sympathetic activation. When dominant, it slows heart rate, constricts pupils, stimulates digestion, and promotes energy conservation. This is sometimes called the "rest and digest" system. Critically, the parasympathetic division is also dominant during the **freeze** response — a point we will return to in Chapter 2.

**The enteric nervous system (ENS)** is a mesh-like network of neurons embedded in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract. Often called the "second brain," it is capable of semi-autonomous function — it can regulate digestion and gut motility independently of the brain, although it communicates with the CNS via the vagus nerve. The ENS is central to the **gut-brain axis**, which you will study in Chapter 2.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** A very common error is treating the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions as an on/off switch — as if one is completely "on" while the other is completely "off." In reality, both operate simultaneously at all times. One is merely **dominant** at any given time. For example, even during intense sympathetic activation (such as running from danger), the parasympathetic division is still active at a low level. This is the concept of **autonomic dominance**, and using this precise language in your exam responses demonstrates sophisticated understanding.

### Standard Diagram: The Nervous System Hierarchy

The standard VCE flowchart for the nervous system hierarchy appears in every major textbook (Jacaranda 8th ed., Edrolo, Nelson) and is frequently the basis for exam questions. You should be able to draw this from memory:

```
                    NERVOUS SYSTEM
                    /            \

               /     \          /       \
           Brain    Spinal   Somatic    Autonomic
                    Cord       NS          NS
                             /    \      /    |    \
                        Sensory  Motor  Symp  Para  Enteric
                       (Afferent)(Efferent)  NS    NS    NS
```

# 2. Conscious and Unconscious Responses

## 2.1 Conscious Responses

A **conscious response** involves **awareness** and is typically **voluntary**. It always involves the **cerebral cortex** (the outer layer of the brain responsible for higher-order thinking). The pathway is:

1. Sensory receptor detects a stimulus (e.g. you see a ball flying toward you)
2. Sensory (afferent) neurons carry the signal via the PNS to the CNS
3. The brain (specifically the cerebral cortex) processes and interprets the information
4. The brain generates a deliberate response
5. Motor (efferent) neurons carry the command from the CNS via the PNS to skeletal muscles
6. The voluntary movement occurs (e.g. you raise your hands to catch the ball)

## 2.2 Unconscious Responses

An **unconscious response** occurs **without awareness** and is **involuntary**. However — and this is where many students make errors — there are **two different types** of unconscious response, and they involve different nervous system structures:

### Type 1: Autonomic Responses

Autonomic responses such as heart rate regulation, breathing, and digestion are unconscious and involuntary. However, they **still involve the brain** — specifically the **brainstem**, which sits at the base of the brain and connects it to the spinal cord. The brainstem contains centres that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and other vital functions.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** In 2023, 55% of students answered a multiple-choice question incorrectly because they believed all unconscious responses bypass the brain. The VCAA examiner report explicitly clarified: "Unconscious responses of the autonomic nervous system, such as heart rate and breathing, require the involvement of both the brain (brainstem) and spinal cord." Only **spinal reflexes** bypass the brain initially.

### Type 2: Spinal Reflexes

A **spinal reflex** is a rapid, involuntary response that is initiated at the spinal cord **without the brain's involvement initially**. The response occurs before the brain even receives the sensory information. The classic example is the withdrawal reflex — pulling your hand away from a hot surface before you consciously feel the pain.

The **spinal reflex arc** follows this sequence:

1. A **sensory receptor** in the skin detects the stimulus (e.g. extreme heat)
2. A **sensory (afferent) neuron** carries the signal to the spinal cord
3. An **interneuron** in the spinal cord relays the signal directly to a motor neuron
4. A **motor (efferent) neuron** carries the command to the relevant muscle
5. The muscle contracts, producing the withdrawal response (e.g. pulling your hand away)
6. **Simultaneously**, the sensory signal ascends to the brain via the spinal cord — but by the time the brain processes the pain, the reflex has already occurred

The biological advantage of spinal reflexes is **speed**. By bypassing the brain's processing time, the body can respond to threats in as little as 20–50 milliseconds — far faster than a conscious response, which might take 150–300 milliseconds. This can be the difference between a minor burn and a severe injury.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The 2023 and 2024 exams both included questions on spinal reflexes. In 2024, 64% of students scored zero on a question about the somatic nervous system and spinal cord's roles in a reflex because they provided generic definitions without connecting them to the specific scenario described in the question. Remember the golden rule: **always link your answer to the scenario**. If the question describes a person touching a hot pan, your answer must reference the hot pan, the hand, and the specific muscles involved — not just define "sensory neuron" and "motor neuron" in the abstract.

# 3. Neuron Structure and Synaptic Transmission

## 3.1 The Structure of a Neuron

A **neuron** (nerve cell) is the fundamental unit of the nervous system. Although neurons come in different shapes and sizes depending on their function, they share a common basic structure:

**Dendrites** are short, branching extensions that **receive** signals from other neurons or sensory receptors. A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites, allowing it to receive input from many sources simultaneously.

**The soma (cell body)** contains the **nucleus** and is the neuron's metabolic centre. It integrates all incoming signals from the dendrites and determines whether the combined input is sufficient to generate an action potential.

**The axon** is a single, long, tube-like extension that transmits electrical impulses **away from** the soma toward the next neuron or target cell. Axons can range from less than a millimetre to over a metre in length (such as the motor neurons running from the spinal cord to the toes).

**The myelin sheath** is a white, fatty insulating layer that wraps around the axon in segments. It serves two critical functions: it **speeds up** the transmission of electrical impulses by enabling saltatory conduction (the impulse "jumps" between gaps rather than travelling continuously), and it **protects** the signal from degradation or interference.

**Nodes of Ranvier** are the small gaps between segments of the myelin sheath. The action potential "jumps" from node to node — a process called **saltatory conduction** — which is far faster than continuous conduction along an unmyelinated axon.

**Terminal buttons (axon terminals)** are the enlarged endpoints of the axon's branches. They contain **synaptic vesicles** — small sacs that store **neurotransmitters** (the chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons).

### A Fundamental Principle

Communication **within** a neuron is **electrical** — the action potential (a brief electrical impulse) travels along the axon. Communication **between** neurons is **chemical** — neurotransmitters carry the signal across the gap between neurons. Neural information travels in **one direction only**: dendrites → soma → axon → terminal buttons → synapse → next neuron's dendrites.

## 3.2 Synaptic Transmission: How Neurons Communicate

The **synapse** (or synaptic cleft) is the tiny gap between the terminal button of one neuron (the **presynaptic neuron**) and the dendrite of the next neuron (the **postsynaptic neuron**). Neurons do not physically touch each other — the synapse is a fluid-filled space approximately 20 nanometres wide.

The process of **synaptic transmission** occurs in a precise sequence:

1. An **action potential** arrives at the presynaptic terminal button
2. The arrival of the action potential causes **calcium ion channels** to open; calcium ions flood into the terminal
3. The influx of calcium triggers **synaptic vesicles** to move toward and **fuse** with the presynaptic membrane
4. **Neurotransmitters** are released from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft via a process called **exocytosis**
5. The neurotransmitters **diffuse** across the synaptic cleft
6. The neurotransmitters **bind** to **complementary receptor sites** on the postsynaptic neuron's dendrite — this is called the **lock-and-key process**, because each neurotransmitter has a specific molecular shape that must match the shape of the receptor (like a key fitting into a lock)
7. The binding triggers either an **excitatory** or **inhibitory** effect on the postsynaptic neuron (explained in the next section)
8. The remaining neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft are cleared by one of three mechanisms: **reuptake** (absorbed back into the presynaptic terminal for recycling), **enzymatic degradation** (broken down by enzymes in the cleft), or **diffusion** (drifting away from the synapse)

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The VCAA examiners consistently reward precise, technical language in synaptic transmission responses. Compare these two answers to a question asking how a neural signal crosses a synapse:
>
> **Weak answer (1/3 marks):** "The message goes across the gap between the neurons using chemicals."
>
> **Strong answer (3/3 marks):** "The neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic terminal button into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis. It diffuses across the cleft and binds to complementary receptor sites on the postsynaptic neuron's dendrite via the lock-and-key process, producing either an excitatory or inhibitory effect."
>
> The difference is terminology. Both answers describe the same process, but the strong answer uses the precise terms the examiners are looking for.

---

# 4. Neurotransmitters: Glutamate and GABA

## 4.1 Excitatory and Inhibitory Effects

When a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces one of two effects:

An **Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP)** makes the postsynaptic neuron **more likely to fire** an action potential. It does this by causing a small **depolarisation** — a shift in the neuron's electrical charge toward the threshold needed to trigger an action potential.

An **Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP)** makes the postsynaptic neuron **less likely to fire** an action potential. It does this by causing a **hyperpolarisation** — a shift in the neuron's electrical charge further away from the threshold.

Whether a neurotransmitter produces an EPSP or IPSP depends on both the neurotransmitter itself and the type of receptor it binds to on the postsynaptic neuron.

## 4.2 Glutamate: The Primary Excitatory Neurotransmitter

**Glutamate** is the brain's **most common excitatory neurotransmitter**, responsible for approximately 75% of all excitatory transmission in the brain. When glutamate binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces an **EPSP**, making that neuron more likely to fire.

Glutamate is essential for:

- **Learning and memory formation** — it is the neurotransmitter most directly involved in synaptic plasticity
- **Cognitive functions** including attention, problem-solving, and information processing
- **Long-term potentiation (LTP)** — glutamate activates NMDA receptors, which are fundamental to the strengthening of synaptic connections (covered in Section 5)

When glutamate levels are abnormally high, excess stimulation can damage and destroy neurons — a process called **excitotoxicity**. This mechanism has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

## 4.3 GABA: The Primary Inhibitory Neurotransmitter

**GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid)** is the brain's **most common inhibitory neurotransmitter**, present at approximately 30–40% of all synapses. When GABA binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, it produces an **IPSP**, making that neuron less likely to fire.

GABA plays a critical regulatory role in:

- **Preventing neural overexcitation** — without GABA, neurons would fire uncontrollably, potentially causing seizures
- **Managing anxiety** — adequate GABA levels help regulate the amygdala's fear response
- **Promoting sleep** — GABA inhibits wakefulness-promoting circuits
- **Concentration and focus** — by suppressing irrelevant neural activity

An important biological fact: GABA is actually **synthesised from glutamate**. The two neurotransmitters are chemically related — glutamate is converted to GABA by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). This means the brain's most important excitatory chemical is the direct precursor of its most important inhibitory chemical — an elegant balance.

**Low GABA levels** are associated with anxiety disorders, insomnia, and epilepsy. This has clinical significance: **benzodiazepines** (a class of medication used to treat anxiety) work by enhancing GABA's inhibitory effects at the synapse, effectively increasing its calming influence on neural activity. You will encounter benzodiazepines again in Unit 4 when studying the treatment of specific phobia.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The relationship between GABA and anxiety/phobia has been directly examined in both 2023 (SA Q7d, 5 marks — benzodiazepines as GABA agonists) and 2024 (MC Q40 — GABA dysfunction in phobias). Students need to be able to explain the three-step chain: **insufficient GABA → unregulated neural activity in the amygdala → heightened, persistent fear response**. This chain connects U3 AOS1 (neurotransmitters) directly to Unit 4 AOS2 (biopsychosocial contributing factors to specific phobia).

## 4.4 Summation: How the Postsynaptic Neuron "Decides"

A single EPSP is usually too weak to trigger an action potential on its own. At any given moment, the postsynaptic neuron is receiving inputs from hundreds or thousands of other neurons simultaneously — some excitatory (EPSPs) and some inhibitory (IPSPs).

**Summation** is the process by which the postsynaptic neuron integrates all incoming EPSPs and IPSPs. If the total excitatory input exceeds the total inhibitory input by enough to reach the neuron's **threshold**, an action potential fires. If it does not reach threshold, no action potential occurs.

This is called the **all-or-none principle**: an action potential either fires at full strength or does not fire at all. There is no partial action potential — it is like a light switch, not a dimmer.

# 5. Synaptic Plasticity: LTP, LTD, and Neural Modifications

## 5.1 What Is Synaptic Plasticity?

**Synaptic plasticity** is the ability of synaptic connections between neurons to **strengthen or weaken over time in response to experience**. It is the fundamental neural mechanism underlying learning and memory — when you learn something new, the physical connections between neurons in your brain change.

The two key mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation (strengthening) and long-term depression (weakening). Together, they allow the brain to adapt, form new memories, refine skills, and discard unused information.

## 5.2 Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)

**Long-term potentiation (LTP)** is the **long-lasting strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons that are frequently co-activated due to repeated stimulation**.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert — Critical Definition:** The 2024 examiner report explicitly flagged that students consistently omit the requirement for "repeated stimulation" when defining LTP. In 2024, 46% of students scored zero on a question about LTP. The complete definition must include: (1) long-lasting, (2) strengthening of a synapse, (3) due to repeated stimulation. Writing "LTP is the strengthening of a synapse" is **incomplete** and may not earn full marks. Always include "due to repeated stimulation."

The principle behind LTP is captured by **Hebb's Rule (1949)**: "Cells that fire together, wire together." When two neurons are repeatedly activated at the same time, the synaptic connection between them becomes progressively stronger and more efficient.

At the cellular level, LTP works like this: with repeated stimulation, the presynaptic neuron releases **more glutamate** into the synapse, and the postsynaptic neuron develops **more receptor sites** on its dendrites. This makes the pathway easier to activate — a smaller input can now produce a larger response. Specifically, LTP involves the activation of **NMDA receptors** (a type of glutamate receptor) and the subsequent addition of **AMPA receptors** to the postsynaptic membrane, which enhances signal reception.

A standard analogy used in VCE classrooms compares LTP to walking a path through long grass. The first time you walk through, it is difficult — the grass is tall and the path is unclear. But the more often you walk the same route, the more the grass is flattened and the path becomes established. Eventually, the path is so well-worn that walking it requires almost no effort. Similarly, the more frequently a neural pathway is activated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes.

### Research in Focus: Bliss and Lømo (1973) — The Discovery of LTP

The existence of LTP was first demonstrated experimentally by Timothy Bliss and Terje Lømo in 1973 at the University of Oslo. Working with anaesthetised rabbits, they placed stimulating electrodes on the **perforant pathway** in the hippocampus and recording electrodes on neurons in the **dentate gyrus**.

They delivered a brief burst of high-frequency electrical stimulation and then measured the response of the postsynaptic neurons. They found that after the high-frequency stimulation, the synaptic response was significantly and rapidly enhanced — the postsynaptic neurons produced **larger EPSPs** that **rose more quickly**. Remarkably, this enhancement was long-lasting: it persisted for hours in brain slices and for days to weeks in intact animals.

This was the first experimental demonstration that synapses in the mammalian brain could undergo lasting strengthening, providing cellular-level evidence for the theoretical framework that Hebb had proposed 24 years earlier. Bliss and Lømo's work is foundational to our understanding of how the brain encodes learning and memory at the synaptic level.

### Research in Focus: Maguire et al. (2000) — London Taxi Drivers

Eleanor Maguire and colleagues at University College London used MRI scanning to compare the brains of licensed London taxi drivers with control participants. London taxi drivers must pass "The Knowledge" — a gruelling qualification requiring memorisation of approximately 25,000 streets and thousands of landmarks across London, typically taking 3–4 years to complete.

Maguire found that taxi drivers had significantly **larger posterior hippocampi** (the region of the hippocampus involved in spatial memory and navigation) compared to controls. Furthermore, the volume of the posterior hippocampus was **positively correlated with years of experience** as a taxi driver — the longer they had been driving, the larger this brain region was.

A 2011 longitudinal follow-up study (Woollett & Maguire) strengthened these findings by tracking individual trainee drivers over 3–4 years, finding that those who successfully qualified showed hippocampal growth compared to their pre-training scans and to trainees who dropped out.

This research powerfully illustrates LTP, sprouting, and adaptive plasticity in humans: intensive, repeated learning produces measurable, lasting structural changes in the brain. It is the most commonly cited example of neuroplasticity in VCE Psychology.

## 5.3 Long-Term Depression (LTD)

**Long-term depression (LTD)** is the **long-lasting weakening of synaptic connections that are not regularly activated**, resulting from lack of stimulation or prolonged low-level stimulation.

When a synaptic pathway is rarely used, the postsynaptic neuron becomes **less responsive** — AMPA receptors are removed from the postsynaptic membrane, reducing the neuron's sensitivity to glutamate. The connection weakens, making it harder to activate. Eventually, unused connections may be eliminated entirely (pruning — see Section 5.4).

LTD is often overlooked by students, but it is **equally important** to learning as LTP. Without LTD, the brain would become overloaded with unnecessary connections. LTD clears unused pathways and refines neural networks, allowing the brain to operate efficiently and allocate resources to the connections that matter most.

The standard analogy is the reverse of the LTP path analogy: a path through long grass that stops being used will gradually become overgrown until it is no longer navigable.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** The term "depression" in LTD refers to **reduced neural activity** at the synapse — not the mental health condition. This is a common source of confusion. If a question asks about LTD, your answer should be about weakened synaptic connections, not about mood or psychological distress.

## 5.4 Neural Modifications: Sprouting, Rerouting, and Pruning

LTP and LTD together drive three types of structural modification in neural networks:

### Sprouting

**Sprouting** is the growth of **new dendritic or axonal branches** to form new synaptic connections. It occurs when neural pathways are frequently activated (via LTP), stimulating the neuron to grow additional branches that create connections with neighbouring neurons.

**Analogy:** A tree growing new branches in the direction of sunlight — it extends toward the resources it needs.

**Example:** When you learn a new skill like playing piano, the repeated practice strengthens existing neural pathways (LTP) and stimulates the growth of new connections (sprouting) between the motor cortex, cerebellum, and auditory cortex. Over time, a dense network of connections forms, supporting fluid, coordinated performance.

### Rerouting

**Rerouting** is the redirection of existing neural connections to create **alternative pathways**, often around damaged or dysfunctional neurons. This is a key mechanism of recovery after brain injury.

**Analogy:** When a road is flooded, traffic is redirected via a detour to reach the same destination by a different route.

**Example:** After a stroke damages neurons in the motor cortex controlling the right hand, surviving neurons may form new connections that partially restore hand function — the signals find alternative routes to reach the same muscles.

### Pruning

**Pruning** is the elimination of **weak, unused synaptic connections**. It is driven by LTD — connections that are not regularly activated weaken progressively until they are removed entirely.

**Analogy:** Trimming dead or unproductive branches from a tree so that the remaining branches receive maximum nutrients and grow more strongly.

**Example:** Infants are born with far more synaptic connections than adults. During childhood and adolescence, the brain undergoes extensive pruning — eliminating connections that are not reinforced by experience while strengthening those that are. This is why early experiences are so influential in shaping brain development. The principle is sometimes summarised as "use it or lose it."

Pruning is not negative — it is essential for efficient brain function. A pruned, refined neural network operates faster and more efficiently than an overgrown, unfocused one.

> **⚠️ Exam Alert:** When discussing sprouting, rerouting, and pruning in exam responses, always connect them to either LTP or LTD. Sprouting and rerouting result from **LTP** (strengthening and growth). Pruning results from **LTD** (weakening and elimination). Simply listing the three modifications without explaining their relationship to LTP/LTD will cost you marks on questions that ask you to explain how synaptic plasticity modifies neural connections.

# 6. Bringing It All Together: How the Nervous System Enables Psychological Functioning

The content in this chapter is not a set of isolated facts — it forms an integrated system. Understanding how the parts connect is essential for high-level exam responses.

The **nervous system hierarchy** (Section 1) tells you which structures are responsible for different types of responses. The **neuron and synaptic transmission** (Sections 3–4) tells you how signals are communicated within and between these structures. **Synaptic plasticity** (Section 5) tells you how these communication pathways change with experience, enabling learning and memory.

When a VCAA exam question gives you a scenario — say, a person learning to drive a car — you should be able to trace the process through multiple levels:

- The somatic NS carries sensory information (visual, auditory, tactile) to the CNS for processing
- The brain's motor cortex generates voluntary commands transmitted via motor neurons to skeletal muscles
- The ANS regulates involuntary responses (heart rate increasing during stressful traffic situations)
- With practice, the neural pathways involved in driving are strengthened through LTP — glutamate release increases, more receptor sites develop, and the pathways become easier to activate
- Sprouting creates new connections between relevant brain regions
- Pathways for incorrect or unnecessary responses weaken through LTD and are eventually pruned
- Eventually, many driving actions become near-automatic — the pathways are so well-established that conscious effort is minimal

This kind of integrated, multi-level response is what earns top marks on extended-answer questions.
