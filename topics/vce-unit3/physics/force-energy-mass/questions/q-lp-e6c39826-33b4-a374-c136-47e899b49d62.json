      "correct": "0.2 m/s",
      "correctExplanation": "The cannon is on the ship, so the recoiling system has mass 500 + 2000 = 2500 kg. 0 = 5 × 100 + 2500 × v. v = −500/2500 = −0.2 m/s.",

      "correct": "6.25 m/s",
      "correctExplanation": "East momentum: 2 × 10 = 20. North momentum: 3 × 8 = 24. Piece C must carry −20 east and −24 north: p = √(20² + 24²) = √976 = 31.24 kg m/s. v = 31.24/5 = 6.25 m/s.",

      "correct": "37.5 J",
      "correctExplanation": "0.3 kg piece: v = 0.2 × 15/0.3 = 10 m/s. Total KE = ½(0.2)(225) + ½(0.3)(100) = 22.5 + 15 = 37.5 J. Since initial KE = 0, all 37.5 J came from the spring.",

      "correct": "150 J",
      "correctExplanation": "50 kg: ½(50)v₁² = 210, v₁ = 2.898 m/s. Momentum: 50 × 2.898 = 144.9 = 70 × v₂. v₂ = 2.07 m/s. KE₂ = ½(70)(2.07²) = 150 J. Alternatively, KE ratio = m₂/m₁ inverted: KE₁/KE₂ = m₂/m₁ = 70/50. KE₂ = 210 × 50/70 = 150 J.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "210 J", "explanation": "The heavier skater receives less KE because it moves slower with the same momentum." },
