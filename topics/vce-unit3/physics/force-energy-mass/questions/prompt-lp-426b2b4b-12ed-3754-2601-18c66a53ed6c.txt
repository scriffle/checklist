TITLE: I can apply the law of conservation of energy to closed systems
CODE: 2A.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
In a closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. The total energy remains constant.

WHY (importance):
This principle allows you to track energy through transformations and solve problems where measuring forces directly would be difficult.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A 1500 kg car pushed 12.6 m with 900 N does 11,340 J of work, but if friction is 900 N, all energy becomes thermal energy and kinetic energy remains zero

SUBTOPIC: Work and Energy
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the concept of work done by forces, calculating work from force-displacement graphs, and understanding kinetic and gravitational potential energy. You will learn to apply formulas and analyse energy transformations quantitatively.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding work and energy is fundamental to explaining how forces transfer energy between objects and systems. These concepts apply to everyday situations from lifting objects to analysing vehicle motion and determining speeds at different heights.

TOPIC: Force, Energy and Mass
SUBJECT: Physics | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: This topic examines work done by forces, energy transformations between kinetic, gravitational potential and elastic potential energy, momentum and impulse in collisions, and the behaviour of ideal springs.

CHAPTER

FORCE, ENERGY AND MASS
Introduction
Energy is a fundamental idea in physics. It orchestrates all events that occur in the universe. Energy
can be kinetic energy, the energy of movement, or potential energy, energy stored in a system. Even
though energy is a foundation for everything we do, its nature can seem abstract and difficult to
understand. We know that energy can be transformed and transferred but cannot be created or
destroyed. In November 1905, Albert Einstein wrote his most famous equation, E = mc2, showing
that there is an equivalence between mass and energy.
This chapter examines how a force can do work before investigating kinetic energy and
gravitational potential energy both quantitatively and qualitatively. You will then consider the
physics of straight-line collisions between two objects and finish by developing an understanding of
Hooke’s law and elastic potential energy of springs.

ENGAGE
The physics of a bungee jump
Inspired by the land divers of Vanuatu who dive off towers
with vines tied to their ankles, two New Zealanders are
credited with the development of a safe bungee cord, and
the world’s first commercial bungee jumping in the 1980s
in New Zealand. The safe bungee cord needs the correct
elasticity so that the bungee jumper is not stopped abruptly.
The slower stop is required to prevent injury. When jumping
with a bungee cord, the gravitational force on the jumper will
initially cause free-fall acceleration until the cord begins to
stretch and exert an upward force on the jumper.
As the cord stretches, the upward force produced increases
with the amount of stretch in the cord. As the cord extends,
the force will eventually increase to become greater than the
downward gravitational force. Therefore, the net force on the
jumper will become upwards. This means that the jumper
will begin to slow down.
The jumper will eventually slow down to a stop; at this point
the cord is at its maximum stretch and will now begin to
contract and propel the jumper back upwards. A bungee jump

kinetic energy and elastic potential energy will all change throughout the jump. Today, bungee jumping is
performed all over the world. Commercial bungee jumps can reach heights greater than 200 m, normally
above water, and some extreme jumpers have even jumped from hot air balloons, falling close to a kilometre.

EXPLAIN
Work
The amount of energy transferred to or from another object or transformed to or from
another form by the action of a force is called work.
The work, W, done when a force, F, causes a displacement, s, in the direction of the force is
given by W = Fs.
If the force, F, is at an angle, θ, to the displacement s, as shown in Figure 2A–2, then the
Formula 2A–1 applies.

LINK
Work is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of work is the joule. One joule of work is done when
a force of magnitude of 1 newton causes a displacement of 1 metre in the same direction as
the force.
The work done on an object can also
cause a change in its kinetic energy.
Fs = ∆Ek
Force perpendicular to
displacement
It is possible to apply a constant force
on an object and not transfer any
energy to the object. This occurs when
the applied force is perpendicular to
displacement. For example, as shown
in Figure 2A-3, when an object is in
uniform circular motion, there is a net
force on the object, but no energy is

the direction of displacement, no work is done.
For example, when an object is in uniform circular
motion, no work is done on the object.

being transferred to it. This is because when in uniform circular motion, the force vector is
perpendicular to the velocity vector, which means that there is no component of force that
acts in the direction of displacement. This explains why the kinetic energy of an object in
uniform circular motion does not increase.
Energy transfers, transformations and the law of conservation of energy
Energy can be transferred from one object to another or transformed from one form to
another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. However, whether energy is conserved in
a system consisting of several objects depends on if it is open or closed. In a closed system,
the total amount of energy will remain the same, this means that energy or mass cannot
be transferred to the surrounding environment, therefore the total amount of energy (and
mass) will remain constant. Many calculation questions in Units 3&4 Physics will occur in
closed systems. The exception to this is inelastic collisions. Inelastic collisions occur in an
open system, where heat and sound energy are lost to the surrounding environment.

Figure 2A–4 Left: The 27 km long Large Hadron Collider, located on the Swiss–French border,
collides beams of protons into each other at close to the speed of light in a highly evacuated vacuum
chamber. These subatomic collisions are considered to be elastic, and the system is assumed to be a
closed one. Right: A car crash is a common inelastic collision that you will study in Unit 3 Physics.
Friction and energy
Imagine that you are pushing a box a distance of 10 m on a thick carpet that provides a lot
of friction to the movement of the box. To push this box at a constant velocity, the 50 N
that you push the box with will be equal to the 50 N friction force in the opposite direction.
The amount of work done to push the box 10 m can be calculated by:
W = Fs
= (50)(10)
= 500 J
However, as soon as you stop pushing the box, it will be stationary, which means the
box has zero kinetic energy. This energy has been converted into thermal energy, that is
stored in both the carpet and the box and some sound energy. The thermal energy and
sound energy is a by-product of the friction between the box and the carpet. The amount
of energy converted into other forms can be calculated using the law of conservation of
energy. Note that friction cannot be thought of as doing negative work on the box as the
carpet is not giving energy to the box.

Worked example 2A–1 Calculating work
A person pushes a 1500 kg car a distance of 12.6 m in the direction of displacement, at a
constant velocity, with a constant force of 900 N. A constant friction force of 900 N acts
in the opposite direction.
a Calculate the work done on the car by the person.
b What is the increase in kinetic energy of the car?
c Determine the energy lost due to the presence of a friction force.
Solution
a W = Fs cos θ
= (900)(12.6) cos (0)
= 900 × 12.6
= 1.13 × 104 J
b Zero, the kinetic energy of the car will not increase (it is travelling at a constant
velocity).
c Since no energy is gained by the car, the energy lost due to the friction force must be
equal to the work done by the person, therefore 1.13 × 104 J.
Worked example 2A–2 Calculating work at an angle
A child pulls a cart a distance of 250 m. The child pulls the cart via a string that
makes an angle of 31.0° to the horizontal. The string has a constant tension of 29.4 N
throughout the journey. Calculate the amount of work done.

Solution
The equation to calculate the force that is parallel to the direction of displacement is:

Force–distance graphs
Force–distance graphs are often used as they visually show the force as a function of the
distance travelled.
If a box is pushed with a constant force of 100 N for 7.00 m, it could be graphed as shown in
Figure 2A–5.

To calculate the amount of work done at any point, you need to calculate the area under

according to the graph in Figure 2A–7 is:
work = area under graph

Sometimes you may be asked to draw your own graph and calculate the work done from
that graph.
Worked example 2A–3 Calculating work from a force–distance graph
A person pushes a car a distance of 300 m. The car is initially pushed with a force of
950 N, this force is then reduced at a constant rate so that when the car has been pushed
300 m, there is no net force on the car. Draw a graph of the force plotted against the

When a weightlifter lifts a weight above their head, they are doing work against gravity to
raise the weight.
If a weightlifter lifts a weight that
has a mass of 160 kg from the
ground to 1.90 m above the ground,
assuming that the bar moves at
a relatively constant speed, the
amount of work done would be
calculated as follows:
W = Fs

= (160)(9.8)(1.9)
= 2979.2 J
Figure 2A–8 Weightlifters do work against gravity to lift
their weights.
For problems that are set close to the surface of Earth, it is assumed that the strength of
Earth’s gravitational field is constant at a value of 9.8 N kg–1. The work done to lift the
weight can be expressed in terms of the gravitational potential energy. Gravitational potential
energy is calculated using either the change in gravitational potential energy from one point
to the other or by defining a point of zero gravitational potential energy and calculating the
gravitational potential energy with reference to that point.

the km h–1 value by 3.6, which means that
converting from m s–1 to km h–1 is done by
multiplying the m s–1 value by 3.6. Most

The kinetic energy–velocity graph is not linear but quadratic. It will take much more energy
to change the velocity of an object by 1 m s–1 if the object’s initial speed is greater. For
example, changing the velocity of a 2 kg object from 0 m s–1 to 1 m s–1 takes 1 J of energy.
But changing the velocity of a 2 kg object from 3 m s–1 to 4 m s–1 takes 7 J of energy.

Figure 2A–11 A ball starts at point A on the ramp with no initial speed.
Taking ground level as the point of zero gravitational potential energy, then at point A
the ball has no kinetic energy but maximum gravitational potential energy. As the ball
rolls down the ramp, the gravitational potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy.
Point B is the point defined as having zero gravitational potential energy, the gravitational
potential energy from point A has all been transformed into kinetic energy. Once
passing point B, the ball begins to rise up the ramp, transforming its kinetic energy into
gravitational potential energy. At point C, halfway up the ramp, the ball has half of the total
energy as stored gravitational potential energy and the other half is kinetic energy. If there
is no friction or air resistance, there will be no energy lost, so the ball will reach point D,
which is equal in height to point A. At point D, the ball will have transformed all of the
remaining kinetic energy into gravitational potential energy.

SKILLS: HOW
VARIABLES
RELATE
Understanding how variables relate to each other
When looking at a formula, it is a useful skill to be able to quickly determine how the
variables in the formula relate to each other. For example, consider the formula for
gravitational potential energy:
E
= mgΔh
g
In this formula, the gravitational potential energy would be directly proportional to the
mass, gravity and change in height.
When one variable is directly proportional to another, then as one variable
becomes larger or smaller the linked variable also becomes larger or smaller. Direct
proportionality can be represented using the symbol ∝. For example, as an object’s
position increases in height, the gravitational potential energy also increases: E
∝ Δh.
g
But what about when the variables have powers or are the denominator in an equation?
For example, consider the formula for centripetal force:
2
F mv
=
c
r
1
The centripetal force is directly proportional to:
• the mass, F
∝ m
c
• the velocity squared, F
∝ v2
c
• one over the radius (i.e. the inverse of the radius), F
∝
c
r
The radius, r, is on the denominator and therefore the centripetal force is directly
proportional to one over the radius, F
∝
c
1 , or inversely proportional to the radius, r. When
r
one variable is inversely proportional to another, then as one variable increases, the
other decreases.
Understanding proportionality can help to determine how an increase in one variable
will affect the other variables. For example, if variable A is directly proportional to
variable B, then variable A divided by variable B will equal a constant (assuming that the
other variables in the equation are unchanged):
k A
B=
Fc
k=
If variable Y was inversely proportional to variable Z, then Y times Z would be equal to
a constant:
Returning to the centripetal force formula above, it can be said that:
v2
k = YZ
In the case of the centripetal force formula above, it can be seen that:
k = F
c
r
Using these proportionality equations can help to solve problems like that on the
following page.

‘Ah, Houston, we’ve had a problem’
Apollo 13, destined for the Moon, encountered a major problem when, during a
routine oxygen stir, a suspected electrical short caused an explosion of an oxygen
tank that disabled the service module (the third stage of the launch rocket). At that
moment, any hope of landing on the Moon was abandoned and all of the efforts were
focused on getting the astronauts back to Earth safely. All three astronauts were forced
to take shelter in the lunar module (LM), which was only intended to support two
people for two days. Since the main engine was on the service module, it was too risky
to use as it may have caused another explosion, instantly killing all of the astronauts.
The team at mission control
came up with a brilliant
solution. They would modify
their course to a free-return
trajectory, using the lunar
module engine. The Moon is
moving at a significant speed
around Earth; if the spacecraft
approached the Moon close
enough, the gravitational force
on the spacecraft by the Moon
would be sufficient to provide
the roughly circular motion
around it and also increase
the speed of the spacecraft

Inertia
It is important to note that momentum and inertia are two different concepts. An object
that is stationary has no momentum, but it has inertia. Inertia is linked to Newton’s first law
of motion and is defined as a body’s tendency to resist a change in its state of motion (this
could be stationary or moving at a constant velocity) when acted upon by a net force. The
inertia of an object depends only on the mass; the greater the mass the greater the inertia.
For example, an 80 kg person travelling at 0.175 m s–1 would have the same momentum as a
0.02 kg bullet travelling at 700 m s–1, but the inertia of the person is much greater.

Change in momentum and impulse
When an object changes its velocity, its momentum also changes. An increase in velocity
means an increase in momentum, a decrease in velocity means a decrease in momentum.
This change in momentum can be expressed mathematically, as shown in Formula 2B–3.

Impulse
the change in
momentum of an
object, caused
by a force acting
for a certain

Remember the only way to change an object’s velocity (and therefore its momentum) is to
apply a net force on the object. If you want to determine the average force during the time
that the force is applied, you can use the following formula:

a vector quantity; it requires both a magnitude and direction. Impulse has units of N s
and is equivalent to the change in momentum. Therefore, impulse can be expressed

Elastic and inelastic collisions
Collisions may be elastic or inelastic. Elastic collisions occur between all gas molecules.
However, perfectly elastic collisions are quite rare for larger objects, as often some of the
energy is converted into heat, sound and deformation of the material. If a collision is 100%
inelastic, then all of the energy is converted into heat, sound and deformation of the material,
and the two colliding objects will be stationary after the collision. To determine if a collision
is elastic or inelastic, the total kinetic energy of all of the objects involved in the collision must
be calculated before and after the collision. If the total kinetic energy before and after the
collision is equal, then it is an elastic collision. If the total kinetic energy before the collision
is greater than the total kinetic energy after the collision, then it is an inelastic collision.
Worked example 2B–7 Inelastic collisions
Two carts on a track, each with a mass of 0.150 kg, collide head on with each other
at 4.5 m s–1. After the collision, the carts move away from each other at 1.25 m s–1
.
A diagram of this situation is shown below.

a Show that the momentum of the carts is conserved.
b Show that this collision is inelastic.
Solution
a Let movement to the right be positive.
∑ momentum before = (4.5)(0.15) + (−4.5)(0.15) = 0
∑ momentum after = (1.25)(0.15) + (−1.25)(0.15) = 0
Since ∑ momentum before = ∑ momentum after, momentum is conserved.
b Note that while momentum is a vector quantity, kinetic energy is a scalar and so
there are no negatives.

Graphing the change in momentum (impulse)
The area under a force–time graph is the impulse. This can be proven as the area
under any section of a graph is the product of the average y-value and the x-value.
Since the value on the y-axis is the force and the value on the x-axis is the time, the
area under the graph is the product of the average force and the time, which is equal to
the impulse.
Worked example 2B–8 Calculating impulse from a force–time graph
A box is pushed with a force of 75 N for
15 s as shown in the graph on the right.
Calculate the magnitude of the impulse
given to the box in this time.
Solution
The impulse would be calculated by
finding the area under the graph:

If the force applied to an object is increasing or decreasing at a constant rate, then a
diagonal line will be produced on a force–time graph. The line will have a constant, not
zero, gradient. The area under the graph, the impulse, can be calculated using the formula
for the area of triangle.
Worked example 2B–9 Calculating impulse from a force–time graph when
the force is changing
A car is accelerated by an initial force
of 35 kN, the force then decreases at a

Equating change in momentum and impulse
The equivalent equations for impulse and change in momentum are shown below:
I = F
av
Δt = Δp = mv – mu
Knowing that impulse and momentum are equal to each other can help you to find the
average force, time, mass, final velocity or initial velocity of an object in a collision. It
is important to recall the units for impulse, N s, and change in momentum, kg m s–1
,
and realise that these two units are interchangeable. It is also useful to recall that the
impulse, and therefore the change in momentum, can be calculated from the area under
a force–time graph.

ENGAGE
A shoe that can make you run 4% faster
On 6 May 2017, Kenyan distance runner, Eliud Kipchoge, attempted what many people
thought was impossible; to run the 42.2 km marathon distance in under two hours. To
do this, he would be required to maintain a speed of 21.1 km h–1. This is equivalent to
running Melbourne’s Tan Track in 10 minutes and 48 seconds, just over 11 times, non-
stop. To help, Eliud wore Nike shoes with improved elastic properties. For almost fifty
years, running shoes had used ethylene vinyl-acetate (EVA) in their midsoles, returning
up to 65% of the runner’s energy as they compress and expand. Nike replaced the
traditional EVA midsole with a new material called Pebax, which was lighter than EVA
and returned up to 87% of the runner’s energy. Another innovation rarely seen at the
time was the use of a carbon-fibre plate that ran the length of the shoe. This plate rocked
the runner onto their toes faster and helped the Pebax to compress and expand quickly.
Various independent studies, as well as running data from the fitness app Strava,
confirmed that the enhanced elastic properties of the shoes can improve running
performance by up to 4%. In his first attempt in 2017, Eliud missed the sub two-hour
mark by just 25 seconds. Other shoe brands released versions with carbon-fibre plates in
them and in the 2020 World Athletics Half Marathon Championships, 92% of the shoes
worn had a carbon-fibre plate in them. Eliud Kipchoge did eventually break the two-hour
marathon in October 2019. However, this was not officially recognised as a world record.

EXPLAIN
Hooke’s law
In order to bend, stretch, twist or compress an object, work must be done on it. If the
object is not damaged, it will return to its original shape once the external force has been
removed. This means that an object is storing energy; this stored energy is known as elastic
potential energy.
If you take three different
springs, A, B and C, and stretch
them all by 0.300 m, it will
require a different amount of
force to stretch each of them to
that length. When the applied
force is plotted against the
Force (N)
extension, a line graph is given.
The graph in red on the right
shows the force applied plotted
against the extension for the
three different springs.

the graph will always pass through the origin and therefore the values for c will always be
zero. The gradient of the graph is the rise

run
metres (giving the unit N m–1).
The gradient represents the stiffness of the spring and the amount of force require to
stretch the spring by one metre. Since the stiffness of springs will vary, the gradients of the
lines will also vary. A stiffer spring will require more force to stretch it by one metre, so a
stiffer spring will have a steeper gradient. The stiffness of an ideal spring is constant; this
value is known as the spring constant and is given the value k.

Robert Hooke recognised the linear relationship that related the force applied to extend

He summarised this relationship in what is now known as Hooke’s law, shown in Formula 2C–1.

Compression or extension of the spring (m)
There is a negative sign to indicate that springs restoring force acts in the opposite
direction to the compression or extension. Usually the negative sign can be ignored in
calculations as long as you remain aware of the direction of the forces on the spring and the
direction of the spring’s restoring force. It is worth noting that this relationship holds true
for many objects other than springs that are stretched or compressed.

A car drives over a bump in the road and the ideal spring that is used in the car suspension

As we previously learned, the area
under a force–displacement graph
is the work done (W = Fs). When
an ideal spring is stretched or
compressed, the force–extension
graph will also give the amount of
work done.
For example, an ideal spring that
has a spring constant of 800 N m–1
is stretched to 1.00 m. The graph
in Figure 2C–3 can be used to
calculate the amount of work done
to stretch the spring.

Extension (m)
Figure 2C–5 As the spring extends, it takes
more and more energy to extend it by the same
amount. The energy required to extend the spring
by 1 m, from 1 m to 2 m, is much less than the
energy required to extend a spring from 4 m to 5 m.
The energy required is indicated by the area
under the graph, highlighted in green.
According to Hooke’s law, F = kx, the more a spring is
extended or compressed, the more force will be required
to continue to extend or compress. For example, to extend
or compress a spring by 1 m when it is originally at its rest
length, does not take as much energy to extend the same
spring by 1 m when it is already extended or compressed.
This is because the more a spring is extended, the greater the
restoring force becomes and therefore more energy must be
applied to overcome this force. This is shown on the graph
in Figure 2C–5, with a spring that has a spring constant of
100 N m–1
.
That progressively more energy is required, at higher degrees
of extension or compression, to extend or compress a spring
by the same amount, can also be proved with Formula 2C–2,
1
the elastic potential energy formula, E
=
kx2. The elastic
s
2
potential energy, E
s, is directly proportional to the extension
or compression squared, x2, which means a change in the
extension will result in a quadratic change in the elastic
potential energy.

So, when finding the change in elastic potential energy, you can either find the area
under the graph or subtract the elastic potential energy of the final length of the spring
from the elastic potential energy of the initial length of the spring. This can be expressed

Horizontal spring systems
Imagine a spring system consisting
of a spring that has the same spring
constant in compression and
extension. The spring is attached
to a wall at one end, has a mass
1 m 1 m
attached to the other end and rests
on a frictionless surface.
When the spring is at rest, it will
be in position B in Figure 2C–6.
If the spring is compressed to

oscillates from point A (fully compressed) through point B

extension will change based on the total energy of the spring
system and the spring constant of the spring. Figures 2C–7 and
2C–8 relate to this system.
position A and then released, it
will naturally oscillate. During the oscillation, the net force and therefore the acceleration
of the mass that is attached to the spring will always be directed towards point B. Point B
is known as the equilibrium position, it is the point in the system where the net force on the
mass is zero. As the mass moves from point A to B to C and back again, elastic potential
energy and kinetic energy are being constantly transformed into each other. Therefore, the
following expression will hold true for any horizontal spring after any amount of time has
passed (assuming no energy is lost):

Point A
At point A, the spring has
maximum compression
(shown in the graph in
Figure 2C-7 as negative
extension). At this point
of maximum compression,
the net force and
acceleration will be at a
maximum because the
spring force is at a
maximum.
100% of the energy in the
system will be elastic
potential energy and the
kinetic energy will be zero
as the mass will be
momentarily stationary.
Point B
As the mass accelerates to
point B the elastic potential
energy will decrease and
the kinetic energy will
increase.
When the mass does reach
point B the spring has no
compression or extension,
therefore it will have zero
elastic potential energy. No
spring compression or
extension means no
horizontal spring force on
the mass and therefore no
horizontal acceleration.
Since the mass will no
longer be accelerated in
this direction the velocity
and therefore the kinetic
energy is at a maximum
and contains 100% of the
energy of the system.
Point C
As the mass moves away
from point B towards point C
it will begin to extend.
The extension causes the
spring potential energy to
increase. As the spring
extends the spring force
increases meaning that
the net force and
acceleration will also
increase which slows the
mass down, decreasing the
kinetic energy.
At point C, the spring has
maximum extension which
means 100% of the
systems energy is elastic
potential energy. The net
force and acceleration will
also be at an equal
maximum to point A but in
an opposite direction.
Point C will also be a
momentary stationary
point, meaning the that
the kinetic energy is zero.
From point C the mass will
then move back to point B
and then to point A.

Vertical spring systems
In a vertical spring system, gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy and elastic potential
energy are all being transformed into each other as the spring oscillates. The following

98 CHAPTER 2 FORCE, ENERGY AND MASS
A common example is an ideal spring that has a mass at one end and is attached to a fixed
support at the other end. When the spring is in position A in Figure 2C–9, the spring has no
extension. The mass is then dropped from position A. Assuming that friction is negligible, the
system will oscillate from this top position to a bottom position, C. Note that the 2 m total
extension will change based on the stiffness of the spring and the mass attached to the spring.
Top (A)
1.0 m
Middle (B)
1.0 m
Bottom (C)
Figure 2C–9 A vertical ideal spring with a mass attached will oscillate from its top to bottom
position continually if friction is ignored. Note that the 2 m total extension will change based on
the spring system. Figures 2C–10 and 2C–11 relate to this system.
The net force, acceleration, elastic potential energy, gravitational potential energy and
kinetic energy of the mass will all change throughout the oscillation, and the change in
these quantities can be represented by the graphs shown in Figure 2C–10.

Point A
At point A, the spring is unstretched, meaning that the elastic potential energy is zero. At
point A there is no spring force but there is the force due to gravity on the mass, which
acts to accelerate it down at 9.8 m s–2. At this point the mass is momentarily stationary
meaning that the kinetic energy is zero.
If we take point C to be the point of zero gravitational potential energy, then point A is when
100% of the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy.

C
Point B
As the mass begins to fall due to the force of gravity, the spring will begin to stretch, hence
the elastic potential energy will increase. As the velocity of the mass is increasing, the
kinetic energy is also increasing and since the height is decreasing, the gravitational
potential energy is also decreasing.
At point B, the mass is in the equilibrium position as the downward force due to gravity is
balanced by the upward spring force (mg = kx). Point B is the point of maximum velocity
and therefore maximum kinetic energy (25% of the total energy). The gravitational
potential energy has now halved.
A
Point C
As the spring moves past point B, the upward spring force becomes greater than the
downwards force due to gravity, meaning the net force and the acceleration is now directed
up. As the spring extends, the upwards net force increases due to an increasing spring
force. Hence, the elastic potential energy will also increase and the velocity will decrease.
At point C, the acceleration will be 9.8 m s–2 up; the spring potential energy will be a
maximum and will account for 100% of the energy of the system. The mass will
momentarily be stationary, meaning that the kinetic energy will be zero and the gravitational
potential energy is defined as zero at this point. The mass will then accelerate to point B.
As is passes point B it will begin to decelerate and become stationary at point A.

Worked example 2C–4 Vertical spring systems
18.0 cm
A spring that has a 1.25 kg mass at one end is
attached to a fixed support and left to oscillate
freely. When oscillating, the maximum
extension in the spring is found to be 18.0 cm.
The diagrams on the right compare the spring
when it is unextended and when it is at a point
of maximum extension.
a On a copy of the diagram showing the spring
when it is unextended, draw all of the forces
acting on the mass.
b Calculate the spring constant of this ideal spring.
c Calculate the maximum velocity of the mass as it is oscillating.
Solution
a Since the spring has no extension, the only force acting on the ball will be the force
due to gravity.
b Take the bottom of the oscillation to be zero gravitational potential energy:
gravitational potential energy at position 1 + elastic potential energy at position 1
+ kinetic energy at position 1 = gravitational potential energy at position 2
+ elastic potential energy at position 2 + kinetic energy at position 2

Understanding graphs
In this course, there are two main elements of
graphs that you need to understand:
• the gradient and area of the graph
• the area under the graph.
The gradient of a graph is the steepness of the
graph; the bigger the gradient, the steeper the
graph. Consider the graph on the right.
To get a sense of the gradient, you can imagine
that the graph is a hill. What would it be like to
walk up and down this graph? Segment AB has
a positive gradient with a moderate steepness,
segment BC has a positive gradient with quite y

You know that:
W = Fs
So, the work done on the spring, and therefore its stored elastic potential energy, is equal
to the area under a force–extension graph.
Question
A group of students are investigating how the elastic potential energy changes with
the extension of the spring. The students select a spring and extend it by 1 cm, 2 cm,
3 cm, 4 cm and 5 cm and record the average force required to stretch the spring to
each length. The students then multiply the average force by the change in length to
get the elastic potential energy. The students square the extension and plot it on a
graph against the elastic potential energy. The students’ graph is shown below.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can apply the law of conservation of energy to closed systems
CODE: 2A.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
In a closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. The total energy remains constant.

WHY (importance):
This principle allows you to track energy through transformations and solve problems where measuring forces directly would be difficult.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A 1500 kg car pushed 12.6 m with 900 N does 11,340 J of work, but if friction is 900 N, all energy becomes thermal energy and kinetic energy remains zero

SUBTOPIC: Work and Energy
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the concept of work done by forces, calculating work from force-displacement graphs, and understanding kinetic and gravitational potential energy. You will learn to apply formulas and analyse energy transformations quantitatively.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding work and energy is fundamental to explaining how forces transfer energy between objects and systems. These concepts apply to everyday situations from lifting objects to analysing vehicle motion and determining speeds at different heights.

TOPIC: Force, Energy and Mass
SUBJECT: Physics | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: This topic examines work done by forces, energy transformations between kinetic, gravitational potential and elastic potential energy, momentum and impulse in collisions, and the behaviour of ideal springs.

CHAPTER

FORCE, ENERGY AND MASS
Introduction
Energy is a fundamental idea in physics. It orchestrates all events that occur in the universe. Energy
can be kinetic energy, the energy of movement, or potential energy, energy stored in a system. Even
though energy is a foundation for everything we do, its nature can seem abstract and difficult to
understand. We know that energy can be transformed and transferred but cannot be created or
destroyed. In November 1905, Albert Einstein wrote his most famous equation, E = mc2, showing
that there is an equivalence between mass and energy.
This chapter examines how a force can do work before investigating kinetic energy and
gravitational potential energy both quantitatively and qualitatively. You will then consider the
physics of straight-line collisions between two objects and finish by developing an understanding of
Hooke’s law and elastic potential energy of springs.

The physics of a bungee jump
Inspired by the land divers of Vanuatu who dive off towers
with vines tied to their ankles, two New Zealanders are
credited with the development of a safe bungee cord, and
the world’s first commercial bungee jumping in the 1980s
in New Zealand. The safe bungee cord needs the correct
elasticity so that the bungee jumper is not stopped abruptly.
The slower stop is required to prevent injury. When jumping
with a bungee cord, the gravitational force on the jumper will
initially cause free-fall acceleration until the cord begins to
stretch and exert an upward force on the jumper.
As the cord stretches, the upward force produced increases
with the amount of stretch in the cord. As the cord extends,
the force will eventually increase to become greater than the
downward gravitational force. Therefore, the net force on the
jumper will become upwards. This means that the jumper
will begin to slow down.
The jumper will eventually slow down to a stop; at this point
the cord is at its maximum stretch and will now begin to
contract and propel the jumper back upwards. A bungee jump

kinetic energy and elastic potential energy will all change throughout the jump. Today, bungee jumping is
performed all over the world. Commercial bungee jumps can reach heights greater than 200 m, normally
above water, and some extreme jumpers have even jumped from hot air balloons, falling close to a kilometre.

EXPLAIN
Work
The amount of energy transferred to or from another object or transformed to or from
another form by the action of a force is called work.
The work, W, done when a force, F, causes a displacement, s, in the direction of the force is
given by W = Fs.
If the force, F, is at an angle, θ, to the displacement s, as shown in Figure 2A–2, then the
Formula 2A–1 applies.

LINK
Work is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of work is the joule. One joule of work is done when
a force of magnitude of 1 newton causes a displacement of 1 metre in the same direction as
the force.
The work done on an object can also
cause a change in its kinetic energy.
Fs = ∆Ek
Force perpendicular to
displacement
It is possible to apply a constant force
on an object and not transfer any
energy to the object. This occurs when
the applied force is perpendicular to
displacement. For example, as shown
in Figure 2A-3, when an object is in
uniform circular motion, there is a net
force on the object, but no energy is

the direction of displacement, no work is done.

motion, no work is done on the object.

being transferred to it. This is because when in uniform circular motion, the force vector is
perpendicular to the velocity vector, which means that there is no component of force that
acts in the direction of displacement. This explains why the kinetic energy of an object in
uniform circular motion does not increase.
Energy transfers, transformations and the law of conservation of energy
Energy can be transferred from one object to another or transformed from one form to
another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. However, whether energy is conserved in
a system consisting of several objects depends on if it is open or closed. In a closed system,
the total amount of energy will remain the same, this means that energy or mass cannot
be transferred to the surrounding environment, therefore the total amount of energy (and
mass) will remain constant. Many calculation questions in Units 3&4 Physics will occur in
closed systems. The exception to this is inelastic collisions. Inelastic collisions occur in an
open system, where heat and sound energy are lost to the surrounding environment.

Figure 2A–4 Left: The 27 km long Large Hadron Collider, located on the Swiss–French border,
collides beams of protons into each other at close to the speed of light in a highly evacuated vacuum
chamber. These subatomic collisions are considered to be elastic, and the system is assumed to be a
closed one. Right: A car crash is a common inelastic collision that you will study in Unit 3 Physics.
Friction and energy
Imagine that you are pushing a box a distance of 10 m on a thick carpet that provides a lot
of friction to the movement of the box. To push this box at a constant velocity, the 50 N
that you push the box with will be equal to the 50 N friction force in the opposite direction.
The amount of work done to push the box 10 m can be calculated by:
W = Fs
= (50)(10)
= 500 J
However, as soon as you stop pushing the box, it will be stationary, which means the
box has zero kinetic energy. This energy has been converted into thermal energy, that is
stored in both the carpet and the box and some sound energy. The thermal energy and
sound energy is a by-product of the friction between the box and the carpet. The amount
of energy converted into other forms can be calculated using the law of conservation of
energy. Note that friction cannot be thought of as doing negative work on the box as the
carpet is not giving energy to the box.

Worked example 2A–1 Calculating work
A person pushes a 1500 kg car a distance of 12.6 m in the direction of displacement, at a
constant velocity, with a constant force of 900 N. A constant friction force of 900 N acts
in the opposite direction.
a Calculate the work done on the car by the person.
b What is the increase in kinetic energy of the car?
c Determine the energy lost due to the presence of a friction force.
Solution
a W = Fs cos θ
= (900)(12.6) cos (0)
= 900 × 12.6
= 1.13 × 104 J
b Zero, the kinetic energy of the car will not increase (it is travelling at a constant
velocity).
c Since no energy is gained by the car, the energy lost due to the friction force must be
equal to the work done by the person, therefore 1.13 × 104 J.
Worked example 2A–2 Calculating work at an angle
A child pulls a cart a distance of 250 m. The child pulls the cart via a string that
makes an angle of 31.0° to the horizontal. The string has a constant tension of 29.4 N
throughout the journey. Calculate the amount of work done.

Solution
The equation to calculate the force that is parallel to the direction of displacement is:

Force–distance graphs
Force–distance graphs are often used as they visually show the force as a function of the
distance travelled.

Figure 2A–5.

To calculate the amount of work done at any point, you need to calculate the area under

according to the graph in Figure 2A–7 is:
work = area under graph

Sometimes you may be asked to draw your own graph and calculate the work done from
that graph.
Worked example 2A–3 Calculating work from a force–distance graph
A person pushes a car a distance of 300 m. The car is initially pushed with a force of
950 N, this force is then reduced at a constant rate so that when the car has been pushed
300 m, there is no net force on the car. Draw a graph of the force plotted against the

When a weightlifter lifts a weight above their head, they are doing work against gravity to
raise the weight.
If a weightlifter lifts a weight that
has a mass of 160 kg from the
ground to 1.90 m above the ground,
assuming that the bar moves at
a relatively constant speed, the
amount of work done would be
calculated as follows:

Figure 2A–8 Weightlifters do work against gravity to lift
their weights.
For problems that are set close to the surface of Earth, it is assumed that the strength of
Earth’s gravitational field is constant at a value of 9.8 N kg–1. The work done to lift the
weight can be expressed in terms of the gravitational potential energy. Gravitational potential
energy is calculated using either the change in gravitational potential energy from one point
to the other or by defining a point of zero gravitational potential energy and calculating the
gravitational potential energy with reference to that point.

the km h–1 value by 3.6, which means that
converting from m s–1 to km h–1 is done by
multiplying the m s–1 value by 3.6. Most

Figure 2A–11 A ball starts at point A on the ramp with no initial speed.
Taking ground level as the point of zero gravitational potential energy, then at point A
the ball has no kinetic energy but maximum gravitational potential energy. As the ball
rolls down the ramp, the gravitational potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy.
Point B is the point defined as having zero gravitational potential energy, the gravitational
potential energy from point A has all been transformed into kinetic energy. Once
passing point B, the ball begins to rise up the ramp, transforming its kinetic energy into
gravitational potential energy. At point C, halfway up the ramp, the ball has half of the total

is no friction or air resistance, there will be no energy lost, so the ball will reach point D,

SKILLS: HOW
VARIABLES
RELATE
Understanding how variables relate to each other
When looking at a formula, it is a useful skill to be able to quickly determine how the
variables in the formula relate to each other. For example, consider the formula for
gravitational potential energy:
E
= mgΔh
g
In this formula, the gravitational potential energy would be directly proportional to the
mass, gravity and change in height.
When one variable is directly proportional to another, then as one variable
becomes larger or smaller the linked variable also becomes larger or smaller. Direct
proportionality can be represented using the symbol ∝. For example, as an object’s
position increases in height, the gravitational potential energy also increases: E
∝ Δh.
g
But what about when the variables have powers or are the denominator in an equation?
For example, consider the formula for centripetal force:
2
F mv
=
c
r
1
The centripetal force is directly proportional to:
• the mass, F
∝ m
c
• the velocity squared, F
∝ v2
c
• one over the radius (i.e. the inverse of the radius), F
∝
c
r
The radius, r, is on the denominator and therefore the centripetal force is directly
proportional to one over the radius, F
∝
c
1 , or inversely proportional to the radius, r. When
r
one variable is inversely proportional to another, then as one variable increases, the
other decreases.
Understanding proportionality can help to determine how an increase in one variable
will affect the other variables. For example, if variable A is directly proportional to
variable B, then variable A divided by variable B will equal a constant (assuming that the
other variables in the equation are unchanged):
k A
B=
Fc
k=
If variable Y was inversely proportional to variable Z, then Y times Z would be equal to
a constant:
Returning to the centripetal force formula above, it can be said that:
v2
k = YZ
In the case of the centripetal force formula above, it can be seen that:
k = F
c
r
Using these proportionality equations can help to solve problems like that on the
following page.

ENGAGE
‘Ah, Houston, we’ve had a problem’
Apollo 13, destined for the Moon, encountered a major problem when, during a
routine oxygen stir, a suspected electrical short caused an explosion of an oxygen
tank that disabled the service module (the third stage of the launch rocket). At that
moment, any hope of landing on the Moon was abandoned and all of the efforts were
focused on getting the astronauts back to Earth safely. All three astronauts were forced
to take shelter in the lunar module (LM), which was only intended to support two
people for two days. Since the main engine was on the service module, it was too risky
to use as it may have caused another explosion, instantly killing all of the astronauts.
The team at mission control
came up with a brilliant
solution. They would modify
their course to a free-return
trajectory, using the lunar
module engine. The Moon is
moving at a significant speed
around Earth; if the spacecraft
approached the Moon close
enough, the gravitational force
on the spacecraft by the Moon
would be sufficient to provide
the roughly circular motion
around it and also increase
the speed of the spacecraft

Inertia
It is important to note that momentum and inertia are two different concepts. An object
that is stationary has no momentum, but it has inertia. Inertia is linked to Newton’s first law
of motion and is defined as a body’s tendency to resist a change in its state of motion (this
could be stationary or moving at a constant velocity) when acted upon by a net force. The
inertia of an object depends only on the mass; the greater the mass the greater the inertia.
For example, an 80 kg person travelling at 0.175 m s–1 would have the same momentum as a
0.02 kg bullet travelling at 700 m s–1, but the inertia of the person is much greater.

Change in momentum and impulse
When an object changes its velocity, its momentum also changes. An increase in velocity
means an increase in momentum, a decrease in velocity means a decrease in momentum.
This change in momentum can be expressed mathematically, as shown in Formula 2B–3.

Impulse
the change in
momentum of an
object, caused
by a force acting
for a certain
amount of time
Remember the only way to change an object’s velocity (and therefore its momentum) is to
apply a net force on the object. If you want to determine the average force during the time
that the force is applied, you can use the following formula:

Therefore, replace m∆v with ∆p:

This means that change in momentum can also be referred to as impulse, I. Impulse is
a vector quantity; it requires both a magnitude and direction. Impulse has units of N s
and is equivalent to the change in momentum. Therefore, impulse can be expressed
mathematically as shown in Formula 2B–4.

Elastic and inelastic collisions
Collisions may be elastic or inelastic. Elastic collisions occur between all gas molecules.
However, perfectly elastic collisions are quite rare for larger objects, as often some of the
energy is converted into heat, sound and deformation of the material. If a collision is 100%
inelastic, then all of the energy is converted into heat, sound and deformation of the material,
and the two colliding objects will be stationary after the collision. To determine if a collision
is elastic or inelastic, the total kinetic energy of all of the objects involved in the collision must
be calculated before and after the collision. If the total kinetic energy before and after the
collision is equal, then it is an elastic collision. If the total kinetic energy before the collision
is greater than the total kinetic energy after the collision, then it is an inelastic collision.
Worked example 2B–7 Inelastic collisions

After:

a Show that the momentum of the carts is conserved.
b Show that this collision is inelastic.
Solution
a Let movement to the right be positive.
∑ momentum before = (4.5)(0.15) + (−4.5)(0.15) = 0
∑ momentum after = (1.25)(0.15) + (−1.25)(0.15) = 0
Since ∑ momentum before = ∑ momentum after, momentum is conserved.
b Note that while momentum is a vector quantity, kinetic energy is a scalar and so
there are no negatives.

Graphing the change in momentum (impulse)
The area under a force–time graph is the impulse. This can be proven as the area
under any section of a graph is the product of the average y-value and the x-value.
Since the value on the y-axis is the force and the value on the x-axis is the time, the
area under the graph is the product of the average force and the time, which is equal to
the impulse.
Worked example 2B–8 Calculating impulse from a force–time graph
A box is pushed with a force of 75 N for
15 s as shown in the graph on the right.
Calculate the magnitude of the impulse
given to the box in this time.
Solution
The impulse would be calculated by
finding the area under the graph:

If the force applied to an object is increasing or decreasing at a constant rate, then a
diagonal line will be produced on a force–time graph. The line will have a constant, not
zero, gradient. The area under the graph, the impulse, can be calculated using the formula
for the area of triangle.
Worked example 2B–9 Calculating impulse from a force–time graph when
the force is changing
A car is accelerated by an initial force
of 35 kN, the force then decreases at a

Equating change in momentum and impulse
The equivalent equations for impulse and change in momentum are shown below:
I = F
av
Δt = Δp = mv – mu
Knowing that impulse and momentum are equal to each other can help you to find the
average force, time, mass, final velocity or initial velocity of an object in a collision. It
is important to recall the units for impulse, N s, and change in momentum, kg m s–1
,
and realise that these two units are interchangeable. It is also useful to recall that the
impulse, and therefore the change in momentum, can be calculated from the area under
a force–time graph.

ENGAGE
A shoe that can make you run 4% faster
On 6 May 2017, Kenyan distance runner, Eliud Kipchoge, attempted what many people
thought was impossible; to run the 42.2 km marathon distance in under two hours. To
do this, he would be required to maintain a speed of 21.1 km h–1. This is equivalent to
running Melbourne’s Tan Track in 10 minutes and 48 seconds, just over 11 times, non-
stop. To help, Eliud wore Nike shoes with improved elastic properties. For almost fifty
years, running shoes had used ethylene vinyl-acetate (EVA) in their midsoles, returning
up to 65% of the runner’s energy as they compress and expand. Nike replaced the
traditional EVA midsole with a new material called Pebax, which was lighter than EVA
and returned up to 87% of the runner’s energy. Another innovation rarely seen at the
time was the use of a carbon-fibre plate that ran the length of the shoe. This plate rocked
the runner onto their toes faster and helped the Pebax to compress and expand quickly.
Various independent studies, as well as running data from the fitness app Strava,
confirmed that the enhanced elastic properties of the shoes can improve running
performance by up to 4%. In his first attempt in 2017, Eliud missed the sub two-hour
mark by just 25 seconds. Other shoe brands released versions with carbon-fibre plates in
them and in the 2020 World Athletics Half Marathon Championships, 92% of the shoes
worn had a carbon-fibre plate in them. Eliud Kipchoge did eventually break the two-hour
marathon in October 2019. However, this was not officially recognised as a world record.

EXPLAIN
Hooke’s law
In order to bend, stretch, twist or compress an object, work must be done on it. If the
object is not damaged, it will return to its original shape once the external force has been
removed. This means that an object is storing energy; this stored energy is known as elastic
potential energy.
If you take three different
springs, A, B and C, and stretch
them all by 0.300 m, it will
require a different amount of
force to stretch each of them to
that length. When the applied
force is plotted against the
Force (N)
extension, a line graph is given.
The graph in red on the right
shows the force applied plotted
against the extension for the
three different springs.

the graph will always pass through the origin and therefore the values for c will always be

metres (giving the unit N m–1).
The gradient represents the stiffness of the spring and the amount of force require to
stretch the spring by one metre. Since the stiffness of springs will vary, the gradients of the
lines will also vary. A stiffer spring will require more force to stretch it by one metre, so a
stiffer spring will have a steeper gradient. The stiffness of an ideal spring is constant; this
value is known as the spring constant and is given the value k.

Robert Hooke recognised the linear relationship that related the force applied to extend

He summarised this relationship in what is now known as Hooke’s law, shown in Formula 2C–1.

Compression or extension of the spring (m)
There is a negative sign to indicate that springs restoring force acts in the opposite
direction to the compression or extension. Usually the negative sign can be ignored in
calculations as long as you remain aware of the direction of the forces on the spring and the
direction of the spring’s restoring force. It is worth noting that this relationship holds true
for many objects other than springs that are stretched or compressed.

A car drives over a bump in the road and the ideal spring that is used in the car suspension

As we previously learned, the area

is the work done (W = Fs). When
an ideal spring is stretched or
compressed, the force–extension
graph will also give the amount of
work done.
For example, an ideal spring that
has a spring constant of 800 N m–1
is stretched to 1.00 m. The graph

The elastic potential energy in Figure 2C–4 would be

elastic potential energy = 0.5 × 1 × 800

The formula for the elastic potential energy can also
be derived from the graph. The area under the graph
is half the product of the y-value multiplied by the

Extension (m)
Figure 2C–5 As the spring extends, it takes
more and more energy to extend it by the same
amount. The energy required to extend the spring
by 1 m, from 1 m to 2 m, is much less than the
energy required to extend a spring from 4 m to 5 m.
The energy required is indicated by the area
under the graph, highlighted in green.
According to Hooke’s law, F = kx, the more a spring is
extended or compressed, the more force will be required
to continue to extend or compress. For example, to extend
or compress a spring by 1 m when it is originally at its rest
length, does not take as much energy to extend the same
spring by 1 m when it is already extended or compressed.
This is because the more a spring is extended, the greater the
restoring force becomes and therefore more energy must be
applied to overcome this force. This is shown on the graph
in Figure 2C–5, with a spring that has a spring constant of
100 N m–1
.
That progressively more energy is required, at higher degrees
of extension or compression, to extend or compress a spring
by the same amount, can also be proved with Formula 2C–2,
1
the elastic potential energy formula, E
=
kx2. The elastic
s
2
potential energy, E
s, is directly proportional to the extension
or compression squared, x2, which means a change in the
extension will result in a quadratic change in the elastic
potential energy.

Horizontal spring systems
Imagine a spring system consisting
of a spring that has the same spring
constant in compression and
extension. The spring is attached
to a wall at one end, has a mass
1 m 1 m
attached to the other end and rests
on a frictionless surface.
When the spring is at rest, it will
be in position B in Figure 2C–6.
If the spring is compressed to

oscillates from point A (fully compressed) through point B

extension will change based on the total energy of the spring
system and the spring constant of the spring. Figures 2C–7 and
2C–8 relate to this system.
position A and then released, it
will naturally oscillate. During the oscillation, the net force and therefore the acceleration
of the mass that is attached to the spring will always be directed towards point B. Point B
is known as the equilibrium position, it is the point in the system where the net force on the
mass is zero. As the mass moves from point A to B to C and back again, elastic potential
energy and kinetic energy are being constantly transformed into each other. Therefore, the
following expression will hold true for any horizontal spring after any amount of time has
passed (assuming no energy is lost):

Point A
At point A, the spring has
maximum compression
(shown in the graph in
Figure 2C-7 as negative
extension). At this point
of maximum compression,
the net force and
acceleration will be at a
maximum because the
spring force is at a
maximum.
100% of the energy in the
system will be elastic
potential energy and the
kinetic energy will be zero
as the mass will be
momentarily stationary.
Point B
As the mass accelerates to
point B the elastic potential
energy will decrease and
the kinetic energy will
increase.
When the mass does reach
point B the spring has no
compression or extension,
therefore it will have zero
elastic potential energy. No
spring compression or
extension means no
horizontal spring force on
the mass and therefore no
horizontal acceleration.
Since the mass will no
longer be accelerated in
this direction the velocity
and therefore the kinetic
energy is at a maximum
and contains 100% of the
energy of the system.
Point C
As the mass moves away
from point B towards point C
it will begin to extend.
The extension causes the
spring potential energy to
increase. As the spring
extends the spring force
increases meaning that
the net force and
acceleration will also
increase which slows the
mass down, decreasing the
kinetic energy.
At point C, the spring has
maximum extension which
means 100% of the
systems energy is elastic
potential energy. The net
force and acceleration will
also be at an equal
maximum to point A but in
an opposite direction.
Point C will also be a
momentary stationary
point, meaning the that
the kinetic energy is zero.
From point C the mass will
then move back to point B
and then to point A.

Vertical spring systems
In a vertical spring system, gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy and elastic potential
energy are all being transformed into each other as the spring oscillates. The following

98 CHAPTER 2 FORCE, ENERGY AND MASS
A common example is an ideal spring that has a mass at one end and is attached to a fixed
support at the other end. When the spring is in position A in Figure 2C–9, the spring has no
extension. The mass is then dropped from position A. Assuming that friction is negligible, the
system will oscillate from this top position to a bottom position, C. Note that the 2 m total
extension will change based on the stiffness of the spring and the mass attached to the spring.
Top (A)
1.0 m

Figure 2C–9 A vertical ideal spring with a mass attached will oscillate from its top to bottom
position continually if friction is ignored. Note that the 2 m total extension will change based on
the spring system. Figures 2C–10 and 2C–11 relate to this system.
The net force, acceleration, elastic potential energy, gravitational potential energy and
kinetic energy of the mass will all change throughout the oscillation, and the change in
these quantities can be represented by the graphs shown in Figure 2C–10.

Point A
At point A, the spring is unstretched, meaning that the elastic potential energy is zero. At
point A there is no spring force but there is the force due to gravity on the mass, which
acts to accelerate it down at 9.8 m s–2. At this point the mass is momentarily stationary
meaning that the kinetic energy is zero.
If we take point C to be the point of zero gravitational potential energy, then point A is when
100% of the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy.

C
Point B
As the mass begins to fall due to the force of gravity, the spring will begin to stretch, hence
the elastic potential energy will increase. As the velocity of the mass is increasing, the
kinetic energy is also increasing and since the height is decreasing, the gravitational
potential energy is also decreasing.
At point B, the mass is in the equilibrium position as the downward force due to gravity is
balanced by the upward spring force (mg = kx). Point B is the point of maximum velocity
and therefore maximum kinetic energy (25% of the total energy). The gravitational
potential energy has now halved.
A
Point C
As the spring moves past point B, the upward spring force becomes greater than the
downwards force due to gravity, meaning the net force and the acceleration is now directed
up. As the spring extends, the upwards net force increases due to an increasing spring
force. Hence, the elastic potential energy will also increase and the velocity will decrease.
At point C, the acceleration will be 9.8 m s–2 up; the spring potential energy will be a
maximum and will account for 100% of the energy of the system. The mass will
momentarily be stationary, meaning that the kinetic energy will be zero and the gravitational
potential energy is defined as zero at this point. The mass will then accelerate to point B.
As is passes point B it will begin to decelerate and become stationary at point A.

seen from the graph in Figure 2C–10 as at any point the sum of the gravitational potential
energy, elastic potential energy and kinetic energy will equal 100%.

Worked example 2C–4 Vertical spring systems
18.0 cm
A spring that has a 1.25 kg mass at one end is
attached to a fixed support and left to oscillate
freely. When oscillating, the maximum
extension in the spring is found to be 18.0 cm.
The diagrams on the right compare the spring
when it is unextended and when it is at a point
of maximum extension.
a On a copy of the diagram showing the spring
when it is unextended, draw all of the forces
acting on the mass.
b Calculate the spring constant of this ideal spring.
c Calculate the maximum velocity of the mass as it is oscillating.
Solution
a Since the spring has no extension, the only force acting on the ball will be the force
due to gravity.
b Take the bottom of the oscillation to be zero gravitational potential energy:
gravitational potential energy at position 1 + elastic potential energy at position 1
+ kinetic energy at position 1 = gravitational potential energy at position 2
+ elastic potential energy at position 2 + kinetic energy at position 2

Understanding graphs
In this course, there are two main elements of
graphs that you need to understand:
• the gradient and area of the graph
• the area under the graph.
The gradient of a graph is the steepness of the
graph; the bigger the gradient, the steeper the
graph. Consider the graph on the right.
To get a sense of the gradient, you can imagine
that the graph is a hill. What would it be like to
walk up and down this graph? Segment AB has
a positive gradient with a moderate steepness,
segment BC has a positive gradient with quite y

You know that:
W = Fs
So, the work done on the spring, and therefore its stored elastic potential energy, is equal
to the area under a force–extension graph.
Question
A group of students are investigating how the elastic potential energy changes with
the extension of the spring. The students select a spring and extend it by 1 cm, 2 cm,
3 cm, 4 cm and 5 cm and record the average force required to stretch the spring to
each length. The students then multiply the average force by the change in length to
get the elastic potential energy. The students square the extension and plot it on a
graph against the elastic potential energy. The students’ graph is shown below.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can apply the law of conservation of energy to closed systems
CODE: 2A.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
In a closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. The total energy remains constant.

WHY (importance):
This principle allows you to track energy through transformations and solve problems where measuring forces directly would be difficult.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A 1500 kg car pushed 12.6 m with 900 N does 11,340 J of work, but if friction is 900 N, all energy becomes thermal energy and kinetic energy remains zero

SUBTOPIC: Work and Energy
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the concept of work done by forces, calculating work from force-displacement graphs, and understanding kinetic and gravitational potential energy. You will learn to apply formulas and analyse energy transformations quantitatively.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding work and energy is fundamental to explaining how forces transfer energy between objects and systems. These concepts apply to everyday situations from lifting objects to analysing vehicle motion and determining speeds at different heights.

TOPIC: Force, Energy and Mass
SUBJECT: Physics | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: This topic examines work done by forces, energy transformations between kinetic, gravitational potential and elastic potential energy, momentum and impulse in collisions, and the behaviour of ideal springs.

CHAPTER
2
FORCE, ENERGY AND MASS
Introduction
Energy is a fundamental idea in physics. It orchestrates all events that occur in the universe. Energy
can be kinetic energy, the energy of movement, or potential energy, energy stored in a system. Even
though energy is a foundation for everything we do, its nature can seem abstract and difficult to
understand. We know that energy can be transformed and transferred but cannot be created or
destroyed. In November 1905, Albert Einstein wrote his most famous equation, E = mc2, showing
that there is an equivalence between mass and energy.
This chapter examines how a force can do work before investigating kinetic energy and
gravitational potential energy both quantitatively and qualitatively. You will then consider the
physics of straight-line collisions between two objects and finish by developing an understanding of
Hooke’s law and elastic potential energy of springs.

energy, gravitational potential energy and
energy dissipated to the environment

The physics of a bungee jump
Inspired by the land divers of Vanuatu who dive off towers
with vines tied to their ankles, two New Zealanders are
credited with the development of a safe bungee cord, and
the world’s first commercial bungee jumping in the 1980s
in New Zealand. The safe bungee cord needs the correct
elasticity so that the bungee jumper is not stopped abruptly.
The slower stop is required to prevent injury. When jumping
with a bungee cord, the gravitational force on the jumper will
initially cause free-fall acceleration until the cord begins to
stretch and exert an upward force on the jumper.
As the cord stretches, the upward force produced increases
with the amount of stretch in the cord. As the cord extends,
the force will eventually increase to become greater than the
downward gravitational force. Therefore, the net force on the
jumper will become upwards. This means that the jumper
will begin to slow down.
The jumper will eventually slow down to a stop; at this point
the cord is at its maximum stretch and will now begin to
contract and propel the jumper back upwards. A bungee jump

site in Queenstown. This was the world’s first

kinetic energy and elastic potential energy will all change throughout the jump. Today, bungee jumping is
performed all over the world. Commercial bungee jumps can reach heights greater than 200 m, normally
above water, and some extreme jumpers have even jumped from hot air balloons, falling close to a kilometre.

or system to

EXPLAIN
Work
The amount of energy transferred to or from another object or transformed to or from
another form by the action of a force is called work.
The work, W, done when a force, F, causes a displacement, s, in the direction of the force is
given by W = Fs.
If the force, F, is at an angle, θ, to the displacement s, as shown in Figure 2A–2, then the
Formula 2A–1 applies.

MOTION
LINK
Work is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of work is the joule. One joule of work is done when
a force of magnitude of 1 newton causes a displacement of 1 metre in the same direction as
the force.
The work done on an object can also
cause a change in its kinetic energy.
Fs = ∆Ek
Force perpendicular to
displacement
It is possible to apply a constant force
on an object and not transfer any
energy to the object. This occurs when
the applied force is perpendicular to
displacement. For example, as shown
in Figure 2A-3, when an object is in
uniform circular motion, there is a net
force on the object, but no energy is

the direction of displacement, no work is done.

motion, no work is done on the object.

being transferred to it. This is because when in uniform circular motion, the force vector is
perpendicular to the velocity vector, which means that there is no component of force that
acts in the direction of displacement. This explains why the kinetic energy of an object in
uniform circular motion does not increase.
Energy transfers, transformations and the law of conservation of energy
Energy can be transferred from one object to another or transformed from one form to
another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. However, whether energy is conserved in
a system consisting of several objects depends on if it is open or closed. In a closed system,
the total amount of energy will remain the same, this means that energy or mass cannot
be transferred to the surrounding environment, therefore the total amount of energy (and
mass) will remain constant. Many calculation questions in Units 3&4 Physics will occur in
closed systems. The exception to this is inelastic collisions. Inelastic collisions occur in an
open system, where heat and sound energy are lost to the surrounding environment.

Figure 2A–4 Left: The 27 km long Large Hadron Collider, located on the Swiss–French border,
collides beams of protons into each other at close to the speed of light in a highly evacuated vacuum
chamber. These subatomic collisions are considered to be elastic, and the system is assumed to be a
closed one. Right: A car crash is a common inelastic collision that you will study in Unit 3 Physics.
Friction and energy
Imagine that you are pushing a box a distance of 10 m on a thick carpet that provides a lot
of friction to the movement of the box. To push this box at a constant velocity, the 50 N
that you push the box with will be equal to the 50 N friction force in the opposite direction.
The amount of work done to push the box 10 m can be calculated by:
W = Fs
= (50)(10)
= 500 J
However, as soon as you stop pushing the box, it will be stationary, which means the
box has zero kinetic energy. This energy has been converted into thermal energy, that is
stored in both the carpet and the box and some sound energy. The thermal energy and
sound energy is a by-product of the friction between the box and the carpet. The amount
of energy converted into other forms can be calculated using the law of conservation of
energy. Note that friction cannot be thought of as doing negative work on the box as the
carpet is not giving energy to the box.

Worked example 2A–1 Calculating work
A person pushes a 1500 kg car a distance of 12.6 m in the direction of displacement, at a
constant velocity, with a constant force of 900 N. A constant friction force of 900 N acts
in the opposite direction.
a Calculate the work done on the car by the person.
b What is the increase in kinetic energy of the car?
c Determine the energy lost due to the presence of a friction force.
Solution
a W = Fs cos θ
= (900)(12.6) cos (0)
= 900 × 12.6
= 1.13 × 104 J
b Zero, the kinetic energy of the car will not increase (it is travelling at a constant
velocity).
c Since no energy is gained by the car, the energy lost due to the friction force must be
equal to the work done by the person, therefore 1.13 × 104 J.
Worked example 2A–2 Calculating work at an angle
A child pulls a cart a distance of 250 m. The child pulls the cart via a string that
makes an angle of 31.0° to the horizontal. The string has a constant tension of 29.4 N
throughout the journey. Calculate the amount of work done.

Solution
The equation to calculate the force that is parallel to the direction of displacement is:

Force–distance graphs
Force–distance graphs are often used as they visually show the force as a function of the
distance travelled.

To calculate the amount of work done at any point, you need to calculate the area under

according to the graph in Figure 2A–7 is:
work = area under graph

Sometimes you may be asked to draw your own graph and calculate the work done from
that graph.
Worked example 2A–3 Calculating work from a force–distance graph
A person pushes a car a distance of 300 m. The car is initially pushed with a force of
950 N, this force is then reduced at a constant rate so that when the car has been pushed
300 m, there is no net force on the car. Draw a graph of the force plotted against the

When a weightlifter lifts a weight above their head, they are doing work against gravity to
raise the weight.
If a weightlifter lifts a weight that
has a mass of 160 kg from the
ground to 1.90 m above the ground,
assuming that the bar moves at
a relatively constant speed, the
amount of work done would be
calculated as follows:

= (160)(9.8)(1.9)
= 2979.2 J
Figure 2A–8 Weightlifters do work against gravity to lift
their weights.
For problems that are set close to the surface of Earth, it is assumed that the strength of
Earth’s gravitational field is constant at a value of 9.8 N kg–1. The work done to lift the
weight can be expressed in terms of the gravitational potential energy. Gravitational potential
energy is calculated using either the change in gravitational potential energy from one point
to the other or by defining a point of zero gravitational potential energy and calculating the
gravitational potential energy with reference to that point.

the km h–1 value by 3.6, which means that
converting from m s–1 to km h–1 is done by
multiplying the m s–1 value by 3.6. Most

Taking ground level as the point of zero gravitational potential energy, then at point A
the ball has no kinetic energy but maximum gravitational potential energy. As the ball
rolls down the ramp, the gravitational potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy.
Point B is the point defined as having zero gravitational potential energy, the gravitational
potential energy from point A has all been transformed into kinetic energy. Once
passing point B, the ball begins to rise up the ramp, transforming its kinetic energy into
gravitational potential energy. At point C, halfway up the ramp, the ball has half of the total
energy as stored gravitational potential energy and the other half is kinetic energy. If there
is no friction or air resistance, there will be no energy lost, so the ball will reach point D,
which is equal in height to point A. At point D, the ball will have transformed all of the
remaining kinetic energy into gravitational potential energy.

SKILLS: HOW
VARIABLES
RELATE
Understanding how variables relate to each other
When looking at a formula, it is a useful skill to be able to quickly determine how the
variables in the formula relate to each other. For example, consider the formula for
gravitational potential energy:
E
= mgΔh
g
In this formula, the gravitational potential energy would be directly proportional to the
mass, gravity and change in height.
When one variable is directly proportional to another, then as one variable
becomes larger or smaller the linked variable also becomes larger or smaller. Direct
proportionality can be represented using the symbol ∝. For example, as an object’s
position increases in height, the gravitational potential energy also increases: E
∝ Δh.
g
But what about when the variables have powers or are the denominator in an equation?
For example, consider the formula for centripetal force:
2
F mv
=
c
r
1
The centripetal force is directly proportional to:
• the mass, F
∝ m
c
• the velocity squared, F
∝ v2
c
• one over the radius (i.e. the inverse of the radius), F
∝
c
r
The radius, r, is on the denominator and therefore the centripetal force is directly
proportional to one over the radius, F
∝
c
1 , or inversely proportional to the radius, r. When
r
one variable is inversely proportional to another, then as one variable increases, the
other decreases.
Understanding proportionality can help to determine how an increase in one variable
will affect the other variables. For example, if variable A is directly proportional to
variable B, then variable A divided by variable B will equal a constant (assuming that the
other variables in the equation are unchanged):
k A
B=
Fc
k=
If variable Y was inversely proportional to variable Z, then Y times Z would be equal to
a constant:
Returning to the centripetal force formula above, it can be said that:
v2
k = YZ
In the case of the centripetal force formula above, it can be seen that:
k = F
c
r
Using these proportionality equations can help to solve problems like that on the
following page.

‘Ah, Houston, we’ve had a problem’
Apollo 13, destined for the Moon, encountered a major problem when, during a
routine oxygen stir, a suspected electrical short caused an explosion of an oxygen
tank that disabled the service module (the third stage of the launch rocket). At that
moment, any hope of landing on the Moon was abandoned and all of the efforts were
focused on getting the astronauts back to Earth safely. All three astronauts were forced
to take shelter in the lunar module (LM), which was only intended to support two
people for two days. Since the main engine was on the service module, it was too risky
to use as it may have caused another explosion, instantly killing all of the astronauts.
The team at mission control
came up with a brilliant
solution. They would modify
their course to a free-return
trajectory, using the lunar
module engine. The Moon is
moving at a significant speed
around Earth; if the spacecraft
approached the Moon close
enough, the gravitational force
on the spacecraft by the Moon
would be sufficient to provide
the roughly circular motion
around it and also increase
the speed of the spacecraft

Inertia
It is important to note that momentum and inertia are two different concepts. An object
that is stationary has no momentum, but it has inertia. Inertia is linked to Newton’s first law
of motion and is defined as a body’s tendency to resist a change in its state of motion (this
could be stationary or moving at a constant velocity) when acted upon by a net force. The
inertia of an object depends only on the mass; the greater the mass the greater the inertia.
For example, an 80 kg person travelling at 0.175 m s–1 would have the same momentum as a
0.02 kg bullet travelling at 700 m s–1, but the inertia of the person is much greater.

Change in momentum and impulse
When an object changes its velocity, its momentum also changes. An increase in velocity
means an increase in momentum, a decrease in velocity means a decrease in momentum.
This change in momentum can be expressed mathematically, as shown in Formula 2B–3.

Impulse
the change in

Elastic and inelastic collisions
Collisions may be elastic or inelastic. Elastic collisions occur between all gas molecules.
However, perfectly elastic collisions are quite rare for larger objects, as often some of the
energy is converted into heat, sound and deformation of the material. If a collision is 100%
inelastic, then all of the energy is converted into heat, sound and deformation of the material,
and the two colliding objects will be stationary after the collision. To determine if a collision
is elastic or inelastic, the total kinetic energy of all of the objects involved in the collision must
be calculated before and after the collision. If the total kinetic energy before and after the
collision is equal, then it is an elastic collision. If the total kinetic energy before the collision
is greater than the total kinetic energy after the collision, then it is an inelastic collision.
Worked example 2B–7 Inelastic collisions

a Show that the momentum of the carts is conserved.
b Show that this collision is inelastic.

a Let movement to the right be positive.
∑ momentum before = (4.5)(0.15) + (−4.5)(0.15) = 0
∑ momentum after = (1.25)(0.15) + (−1.25)(0.15) = 0
Since ∑ momentum before = ∑ momentum after, momentum is conserved.
b Note that while momentum is a vector quantity, kinetic energy is a scalar and so
there are no negatives.

Graphing the change in momentum (impulse)
The area under a force–time graph is the impulse. This can be proven as the area
under any section of a graph is the product of the average y-value and the x-value.
Since the value on the y-axis is the force and the value on the x-axis is the time, the
area under the graph is the product of the average force and the time, which is equal to
the impulse.
Worked example 2B–8 Calculating impulse from a force–time graph
A box is pushed with a force of 75 N for
15 s as shown in the graph on the right.
Calculate the magnitude of the impulse
given to the box in this time.

The impulse would be calculated by

If the force applied to an object is increasing or decreasing at a constant rate, then a
diagonal line will be produced on a force–time graph. The line will have a constant, not
zero, gradient. The area under the graph, the impulse, can be calculated using the formula
for the area of triangle.

Equating change in momentum and impulse
The equivalent equations for impulse and change in momentum are shown below:
I = F
av
Δt = Δp = mv – mu
Knowing that impulse and momentum are equal to each other can help you to find the
average force, time, mass, final velocity or initial velocity of an object in a collision. It
is important to recall the units for impulse, N s, and change in momentum, kg m s–1
,
and realise that these two units are interchangeable. It is also useful to recall that the
impulse, and therefore the change in momentum, can be calculated from the area under
a force–time graph.

ENGAGE
A shoe that can make you run 4% faster
On 6 May 2017, Kenyan distance runner, Eliud Kipchoge, attempted what many people
thought was impossible; to run the 42.2 km marathon distance in under two hours. To
do this, he would be required to maintain a speed of 21.1 km h–1. This is equivalent to
running Melbourne’s Tan Track in 10 minutes and 48 seconds, just over 11 times, non-
stop. To help, Eliud wore Nike shoes with improved elastic properties. For almost fifty
years, running shoes had used ethylene vinyl-acetate (EVA) in their midsoles, returning
up to 65% of the runner’s energy as they compress and expand. Nike replaced the
traditional EVA midsole with a new material called Pebax, which was lighter than EVA
and returned up to 87% of the runner’s energy. Another innovation rarely seen at the
time was the use of a carbon-fibre plate that ran the length of the shoe. This plate rocked
the runner onto their toes faster and helped the Pebax to compress and expand quickly.
Various independent studies, as well as running data from the fitness app Strava,
confirmed that the enhanced elastic properties of the shoes can improve running
performance by up to 4%. In his first attempt in 2017, Eliud missed the sub two-hour
mark by just 25 seconds. Other shoe brands released versions with carbon-fibre plates in
them and in the 2020 World Athletics Half Marathon Championships, 92% of the shoes
worn had a carbon-fibre plate in them. Eliud Kipchoge did eventually break the two-hour
marathon in October 2019. However, this was not officially recognised as a world record.

EXPLAIN
Hooke’s law
In order to bend, stretch, twist or compress an object, work must be done on it. If the
object is not damaged, it will return to its original shape once the external force has been
removed. This means that an object is storing energy; this stored energy is known as elastic
potential energy.
If you take three different
springs, A, B and C, and stretch
them all by 0.300 m, it will
require a different amount of
force to stretch each of them to
that length. When the applied
force is plotted against the
Force (N)
extension, a line graph is given.
The graph in red on the right
shows the force applied plotted
against the extension for the
three different springs.

the graph will always pass through the origin and therefore the values for c will always be
zero. The gradient of the graph is the rise

metres (giving the unit N m–1).
The gradient represents the stiffness of the spring and the amount of force require to
stretch the spring by one metre. Since the stiffness of springs will vary, the gradients of the
lines will also vary. A stiffer spring will require more force to stretch it by one metre, so a
stiffer spring will have a steeper gradient. The stiffness of an ideal spring is constant; this
value is known as the spring constant and is given the value k.

Robert Hooke recognised the linear relationship that related the force applied to extend

He summarised this relationship in what is now known as Hooke’s law, shown in Formula 2C–1.

Compression or extension of the spring (m)
There is a negative sign to indicate that springs restoring force acts in the opposite
direction to the compression or extension. Usually the negative sign can be ignored in
calculations as long as you remain aware of the direction of the forces on the spring and the
direction of the spring’s restoring force. It is worth noting that this relationship holds true
for many objects other than springs that are stretched or compressed.
Worked example 2C–2 Using Hooke’s law
A car drives over a bump in the road and the ideal spring that is used in the car suspension

As we previously learned, the area

is the work done (W = Fs). When
an ideal spring is stretched or
compressed, the force–extension
graph will also give the amount of
work done.
For example, an ideal spring that
has a spring constant of 800 N m–1
is stretched to 1.00 m. The graph

The elastic potential energy in Figure 2C–4 would be

The formula for the elastic potential energy can also
be derived from the graph. The area under the graph

Extension (m)
Figure 2C–5 As the spring extends, it takes
more and more energy to extend it by the same
amount. The energy required to extend the spring
by 1 m, from 1 m to 2 m, is much less than the
energy required to extend a spring from 4 m to 5 m.
The energy required is indicated by the area
under the graph, highlighted in green.
According to Hooke’s law, F = kx, the more a spring is
extended or compressed, the more force will be required
to continue to extend or compress. For example, to extend
or compress a spring by 1 m when it is originally at its rest
length, does not take as much energy to extend the same
spring by 1 m when it is already extended or compressed.
This is because the more a spring is extended, the greater the
restoring force becomes and therefore more energy must be
applied to overcome this force. This is shown on the graph
in Figure 2C–5, with a spring that has a spring constant of
100 N m–1
.
That progressively more energy is required, at higher degrees
of extension or compression, to extend or compress a spring
by the same amount, can also be proved with Formula 2C–2,
1
the elastic potential energy formula, E
=
kx2. The elastic
s
2
potential energy, E
s, is directly proportional to the extension
or compression squared, x2, which means a change in the
extension will result in a quadratic change in the elastic
potential energy.

So, when finding the change in elastic potential energy, you can either find the area
under the graph or subtract the elastic potential energy of the final length of the spring
from the elastic potential energy of the initial length of the spring. This can be expressed

will naturally oscillate. During the oscillation, the net force and therefore the acceleration
of the mass that is attached to the spring will always be directed towards point B. Point B
is known as the equilibrium position, it is the point in the system where the net force on the
mass is zero. As the mass moves from point A to B to C and back again, elastic potential
energy and kinetic energy are being constantly transformed into each other. Therefore, the

passed (assuming no energy is lost):

Point A
At point A, the spring has
maximum compression
(shown in the graph in
Figure 2C-7 as negative
extension). At this point
of maximum compression,
the net force and
acceleration will be at a
maximum because the
spring force is at a
maximum.
100% of the energy in the
system will be elastic
potential energy and the
kinetic energy will be zero
as the mass will be
momentarily stationary.
Point B
As the mass accelerates to
point B the elastic potential
energy will decrease and
the kinetic energy will
increase.
When the mass does reach
point B the spring has no
compression or extension,
therefore it will have zero
elastic potential energy. No
spring compression or
extension means no
horizontal spring force on
the mass and therefore no
horizontal acceleration.
Since the mass will no
longer be accelerated in
this direction the velocity
and therefore the kinetic
energy is at a maximum
and contains 100% of the
energy of the system.
Point C
As the mass moves away
from point B towards point C
it will begin to extend.
The extension causes the
spring potential energy to
increase. As the spring
extends the spring force
increases meaning that
the net force and
acceleration will also
increase which slows the
mass down, decreasing the
kinetic energy.
At point C, the spring has
maximum extension which
means 100% of the
systems energy is elastic
potential energy. The net
force and acceleration will
also be at an equal
maximum to point A but in
an opposite direction.
Point C will also be a
momentary stationary
point, meaning the that
the kinetic energy is zero.
From point C the mass will
then move back to point B
and then to point A.

In a vertical spring system, gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy and elastic potential

98 CHAPTER 2 FORCE, ENERGY AND MASS
A common example is an ideal spring that has a mass at one end and is attached to a fixed
support at the other end. When the spring is in position A in Figure 2C–9, the spring has no
extension. The mass is then dropped from position A. Assuming that friction is negligible, the
system will oscillate from this top position to a bottom position, C. Note that the 2 m total
extension will change based on the stiffness of the spring and the mass attached to the spring.
Top (A)
1.0 m
Middle (B)

Figure 2C–9 A vertical ideal spring with a mass attached will oscillate from its top to bottom
position continually if friction is ignored. Note that the 2 m total extension will change based on
the spring system. Figures 2C–10 and 2C–11 relate to this system.
The net force, acceleration, elastic potential energy, gravitational potential energy and
kinetic energy of the mass will all change throughout the oscillation, and the change in
these quantities can be represented by the graphs shown in Figure 2C–10.

Point A
At point A, the spring is unstretched, meaning that the elastic potential energy is zero. At
point A there is no spring force but there is the force due to gravity on the mass, which
acts to accelerate it down at 9.8 m s–2. At this point the mass is momentarily stationary
meaning that the kinetic energy is zero.
If we take point C to be the point of zero gravitational potential energy, then point A is when
100% of the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy.

C
Point B
As the mass begins to fall due to the force of gravity, the spring will begin to stretch, hence
the elastic potential energy will increase. As the velocity of the mass is increasing, the
kinetic energy is also increasing and since the height is decreasing, the gravitational
potential energy is also decreasing.
At point B, the mass is in the equilibrium position as the downward force due to gravity is
balanced by the upward spring force (mg = kx). Point B is the point of maximum velocity
and therefore maximum kinetic energy (25% of the total energy). The gravitational
potential energy has now halved.
A
Point C
As the spring moves past point B, the upward spring force becomes greater than the
downwards force due to gravity, meaning the net force and the acceleration is now directed
up. As the spring extends, the upwards net force increases due to an increasing spring
force. Hence, the elastic potential energy will also increase and the velocity will decrease.
At point C, the acceleration will be 9.8 m s–2 up; the spring potential energy will be a
maximum and will account for 100% of the energy of the system. The mass will
momentarily be stationary, meaning that the kinetic energy will be zero and the gravitational
potential energy is defined as zero at this point. The mass will then accelerate to point B.
As is passes point B it will begin to decelerate and become stationary at point A.

Worked example 2C–4 Vertical spring systems
18.0 cm
A spring that has a 1.25 kg mass at one end is
attached to a fixed support and left to oscillate
freely. When oscillating, the maximum
extension in the spring is found to be 18.0 cm.
The diagrams on the right compare the spring
when it is unextended and when it is at a point
of maximum extension.
a On a copy of the diagram showing the spring
when it is unextended, draw all of the forces
acting on the mass.
b Calculate the spring constant of this ideal spring.
c Calculate the maximum velocity of the mass as it is oscillating.
Solution
a Since the spring has no extension, the only force acting on the ball will be the force
due to gravity.
b Take the bottom of the oscillation to be zero gravitational potential energy:
gravitational potential energy at position 1 + elastic potential energy at position 1
+ kinetic energy at position 1 = gravitational potential energy at position 2
+ elastic potential energy at position 2 + kinetic energy at position 2

Understanding graphs
In this course, there are two main elements of
graphs that you need to understand:
• the gradient and area of the graph
• the area under the graph.
The gradient of a graph is the steepness of the
graph; the bigger the gradient, the steeper the
graph. Consider the graph on the right.
To get a sense of the gradient, you can imagine
that the graph is a hill. What would it be like to
walk up and down this graph? Segment AB has
a positive gradient with a moderate steepness,
segment BC has a positive gradient with quite y

a steep (large) gradient. Segment CD is flat and
therefore has a gradient of zero. Segment DE has

You know that:
W = Fs
So, the work done on the spring, and therefore its stored elastic potential energy, is equal
to the area under a force–extension graph.
Question
A group of students are investigating how the elastic potential energy changes with
the extension of the spring. The students select a spring and extend it by 1 cm, 2 cm,
3 cm, 4 cm and 5 cm and record the average force required to stretch the spring to
each length. The students then multiply the average force by the change in length to
get the elastic potential energy. The students square the extension and plot it on a
graph against the elastic potential energy. The students’ graph is shown below.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can apply the law of conservation of energy to closed systems
CODE: 2A.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
In a closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. The total energy remains constant.

WHY (importance):
This principle allows you to track energy through transformations and solve problems where measuring forces directly would be difficult.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A 1500 kg car pushed 12.6 m with 900 N does 11,340 J of work, but if friction is 900 N, all energy becomes thermal energy and kinetic energy remains zero

SUBTOPIC: Work and Energy
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the concept of work done by forces, calculating work from force-displacement graphs, and understanding kinetic and gravitational potential energy. You will learn to apply formulas and analyse energy transformations quantitatively.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding work and energy is fundamental to explaining how forces transfer energy between objects and systems. These concepts apply to everyday situations from lifting objects to analysing vehicle motion and determining speeds at different heights.

TOPIC: Force, Energy and Mass
SUBJECT: Physics | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: This topic examines work done by forces, energy transformations between kinetic, gravitational potential and elastic potential energy, momentum and impulse in collisions, and the behaviour of ideal springs.

CHAPTER

FORCE, ENERGY AND MASS
Introduction
Energy is a fundamental idea in physics. It orchestrates all events that occur in the universe. Energy
can be kinetic energy, the energy of movement, or potential energy, energy stored in a system. Even
though energy is a foundation for everything we do, its nature can seem abstract and difficult to
understand. We know that energy can be transformed and transferred but cannot be created or
destroyed. In November 1905, Albert Einstein wrote his most famous equation, E = mc2, showing
that there is an equivalence between mass and energy.
This chapter examines how a force can do work before investigating kinetic energy and
gravitational potential energy both quantitatively and qualitatively. You will then consider the
physics of straight-line collisions between two objects and finish by developing an understanding of
Hooke’s law and elastic potential energy of springs.

ENGAGE
The physics of a bungee jump
Inspired by the land divers of Vanuatu who dive off towers
with vines tied to their ankles, two New Zealanders are
credited with the development of a safe bungee cord, and
the world’s first commercial bungee jumping in the 1980s
in New Zealand. The safe bungee cord needs the correct
elasticity so that the bungee jumper is not stopped abruptly.
The slower stop is required to prevent injury. When jumping
with a bungee cord, the gravitational force on the jumper will
initially cause free-fall acceleration until the cord begins to
stretch and exert an upward force on the jumper.
As the cord stretches, the upward force produced increases
with the amount of stretch in the cord. As the cord extends,
the force will eventually increase to become greater than the
downward gravitational force. Therefore, the net force on the
jumper will become upwards. This means that the jumper
will begin to slow down.
The jumper will eventually slow down to a stop; at this point
the cord is at its maximum stretch and will now begin to
contract and propel the jumper back upwards. A bungee jump

kinetic energy and elastic potential energy will all change throughout the jump. Today, bungee jumping is
performed all over the world. Commercial bungee jumps can reach heights greater than 200 m, normally
above water, and some extreme jumpers have even jumped from hot air balloons, falling close to a kilometre.

EXPLAIN
Work
The amount of energy transferred to or from another object or transformed to or from
another form by the action of a force is called work.
The work, W, done when a force, F, causes a displacement, s, in the direction of the force is
given by W = Fs.
If the force, F, is at an angle, θ, to the displacement s, as shown in Figure 2A–2, then the
Formula 2A–1 applies.

LINK
Work is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of work is the joule. One joule of work is done when
a force of magnitude of 1 newton causes a displacement of 1 metre in the same direction as
the force.
The work done on an object can also
cause a change in its kinetic energy.
Fs = ∆Ek
Force perpendicular to
displacement
It is possible to apply a constant force
on an object and not transfer any
energy to the object. This occurs when
the applied force is perpendicular to
displacement. For example, as shown
in Figure 2A-3, when an object is in
uniform circular motion, there is a net
force on the object, but no energy is

the direction of displacement, no work is done.

being transferred to it. This is because when in uniform circular motion, the force vector is
perpendicular to the velocity vector, which means that there is no component of force that
acts in the direction of displacement. This explains why the kinetic energy of an object in
uniform circular motion does not increase.
Energy transfers, transformations and the law of conservation of energy
Energy can be transferred from one object to another or transformed from one form to
another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. However, whether energy is conserved in
a system consisting of several objects depends on if it is open or closed. In a closed system,
the total amount of energy will remain the same, this means that energy or mass cannot
be transferred to the surrounding environment, therefore the total amount of energy (and
mass) will remain constant. Many calculation questions in Units 3&4 Physics will occur in
closed systems. The exception to this is inelastic collisions. Inelastic collisions occur in an
open system, where heat and sound energy are lost to the surrounding environment.

chamber. These subatomic collisions are considered to be elastic, and the system is assumed to be a
closed one. Right: A car crash is a common inelastic collision that you will study in Unit 3 Physics.
Friction and energy
Imagine that you are pushing a box a distance of 10 m on a thick carpet that provides a lot
of friction to the movement of the box. To push this box at a constant velocity, the 50 N
that you push the box with will be equal to the 50 N friction force in the opposite direction.
The amount of work done to push the box 10 m can be calculated by:
W = Fs
= (50)(10)
= 500 J
However, as soon as you stop pushing the box, it will be stationary, which means the
box has zero kinetic energy. This energy has been converted into thermal energy, that is
stored in both the carpet and the box and some sound energy. The thermal energy and
sound energy is a by-product of the friction between the box and the carpet. The amount
of energy converted into other forms can be calculated using the law of conservation of
energy. Note that friction cannot be thought of as doing negative work on the box as the
carpet is not giving energy to the box.

Worked example 2A–1 Calculating work
A person pushes a 1500 kg car a distance of 12.6 m in the direction of displacement, at a
constant velocity, with a constant force of 900 N. A constant friction force of 900 N acts
in the opposite direction.
a Calculate the work done on the car by the person.
b What is the increase in kinetic energy of the car?
c Determine the energy lost due to the presence of a friction force.
Solution
a W = Fs cos θ
= (900)(12.6) cos (0)
= 900 × 12.6
= 1.13 × 104 J
b Zero, the kinetic energy of the car will not increase (it is travelling at a constant
velocity).
c Since no energy is gained by the car, the energy lost due to the friction force must be
equal to the work done by the person, therefore 1.13 × 104 J.
Worked example 2A–2 Calculating work at an angle
A child pulls a cart a distance of 250 m. The child pulls the cart via a string that
makes an angle of 31.0° to the horizontal. The string has a constant tension of 29.4 N
throughout the journey. Calculate the amount of work done.

Solution
The equation to calculate the force that is parallel to the direction of displacement is:

Force–distance graphs
Force–distance graphs are often used as they visually show the force as a function of the
distance travelled.

according to the graph in Figure 2A–7 is:

Sometimes you may be asked to draw your own graph and calculate the work done from
that graph.

A person pushes a car a distance of 300 m. The car is initially pushed with a force of

When a weightlifter lifts a weight above their head, they are doing work against gravity to
raise the weight.
If a weightlifter lifts a weight that
has a mass of 160 kg from the
ground to 1.90 m above the ground,
assuming that the bar moves at
a relatively constant speed, the
amount of work done would be
calculated as follows:

Figure 2A–8 Weightlifters do work against gravity to lift
their weights.
For problems that are set close to the surface of Earth, it is assumed that the strength of
Earth’s gravitational field is constant at a value of 9.8 N kg–1. The work done to lift the
weight can be expressed in terms of the gravitational potential energy. Gravitational potential
energy is calculated using either the change in gravitational potential energy from one point
to the other or by defining a point of zero gravitational potential energy and calculating the
gravitational potential energy with reference to that point.

Taking ground level as the point of zero gravitational potential energy, then at point A

rolls down the ramp, the gravitational potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy.
Point B is the point defined as having zero gravitational potential energy, the gravitational
potential energy from point A has all been transformed into kinetic energy. Once
passing point B, the ball begins to rise up the ramp, transforming its kinetic energy into
gravitational potential energy. At point C, halfway up the ramp, the ball has half of the total

SKILLS: HOW
VARIABLES
RELATE
Understanding how variables relate to each other
When looking at a formula, it is a useful skill to be able to quickly determine how the
variables in the formula relate to each other. For example, consider the formula for
gravitational potential energy:
E
= mgΔh
g
In this formula, the gravitational potential energy would be directly proportional to the
mass, gravity and change in height.
When one variable is directly proportional to another, then as one variable
becomes larger or smaller the linked variable also becomes larger or smaller. Direct
proportionality can be represented using the symbol ∝. For example, as an object’s
position increases in height, the gravitational potential energy also increases: E
∝ Δh.
g
But what about when the variables have powers or are the denominator in an equation?
For example, consider the formula for centripetal force:
2
F mv
=
c
r
1
The centripetal force is directly proportional to:
• the mass, F
∝ m
c
• the velocity squared, F
∝ v2
c
• one over the radius (i.e. the inverse of the radius), F
∝
c
r
The radius, r, is on the denominator and therefore the centripetal force is directly
proportional to one over the radius, F
∝
c
1 , or inversely proportional to the radius, r. When
r
one variable is inversely proportional to another, then as one variable increases, the
other decreases.
Understanding proportionality can help to determine how an increase in one variable
will affect the other variables. For example, if variable A is directly proportional to
variable B, then variable A divided by variable B will equal a constant (assuming that the
other variables in the equation are unchanged):
k A
B=
Fc
k=
If variable Y was inversely proportional to variable Z, then Y times Z would be equal to
a constant:
Returning to the centripetal force formula above, it can be said that:

ENGAGE
‘Ah, Houston, we’ve had a problem’
Apollo 13, destined for the Moon, encountered a major problem when, during a
routine oxygen stir, a suspected electrical short caused an explosion of an oxygen
tank that disabled the service module (the third stage of the launch rocket). At that
moment, any hope of landing on the Moon was abandoned and all of the efforts were
focused on getting the astronauts back to Earth safely. All three astronauts were forced
to take shelter in the lunar module (LM), which was only intended to support two
people for two days. Since the main engine was on the service module, it was too risky
to use as it may have caused another explosion, instantly killing all of the astronauts.
The team at mission control
came up with a brilliant
solution. They would modify
their course to a free-return
trajectory, using the lunar
module engine. The Moon is
moving at a significant speed
around Earth; if the spacecraft
approached the Moon close
enough, the gravitational force
on the spacecraft by the Moon
would be sufficient to provide
the roughly circular motion
around it and also increase
the speed of the spacecraft

as it travels with the Moon.

This manoeuvre is termed
safely to Earth
a ‘gravitational slingshot’ and it works by transferring some of the Moon’s orbital
momentum to the spacecraft.

Inertia is
dependent only
upon the mass
of the body.
Inertia
It is important to note that momentum and inertia are two different concepts. An object
that is stationary has no momentum, but it has inertia. Inertia is linked to Newton’s first law
of motion and is defined as a body’s tendency to resist a change in its state of motion (this
could be stationary or moving at a constant velocity) when acted upon by a net force. The
inertia of an object depends only on the mass; the greater the mass the greater the inertia.
For example, an 80 kg person travelling at 0.175 m s–1 would have the same momentum as a
0.02 kg bullet travelling at 700 m s–1, but the inertia of the person is much greater.

2 On an ice hockey rink, a keen physics student observes that there are many collisions.
a In one collision, two hockey pucks of equal mass collide head on, each with a speed
of 7.25 m s–1. One of the hockey pucks moves away with a velocity of 3.99 m s–1 south
after the collision. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the other
hockey puck after the collision.
b In another collision, an 85.7 kg hockey player, who is initially at rest, hits the
stationary 154 g hockey puck. The hockey puck moves north with a velocity of 22.5
m s–1 north after the collision. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the velocity
of the hockey player after the collision.
c Later on the ice hockey rink, the 85.7 kg hockey player is travelling 8.45 m s–1 south
when they collide with a 93.4 kg player, who is travelling at 4.22 m s–1 north. After the
collision, the two players move as one. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the
velocity of the hockey players after the collision.
Change in momentum and impulse
When an object changes its velocity, its momentum also changes. An increase in velocity
means an increase in momentum, a decrease in velocity means a decrease in momentum.
This change in momentum can be expressed mathematically, as shown in Formula 2B–3.

Impulse
the change in
momentum of an
object, caused
by a force acting
for a certain
amount of time
Remember the only way to change an object’s velocity (and therefore its momentum) is to
apply a net force on the object. If you want to determine the average force during the time
that the force is applied, you can use the following formula:
Fav

Therefore, replace m∆v with ∆p:

This means that change in momentum can also be referred to as impulse, I. Impulse is
a vector quantity; it requires both a magnitude and direction. Impulse has units of N s
and is equivalent to the change in momentum. Therefore, impulse can be expressed
mathematically as shown in Formula 2B–4.

Elastic and inelastic collisions
Collisions may be elastic or inelastic. Elastic collisions occur between all gas molecules.
However, perfectly elastic collisions are quite rare for larger objects, as often some of the
energy is converted into heat, sound and deformation of the material. If a collision is 100%
inelastic, then all of the energy is converted into heat, sound and deformation of the material,
and the two colliding objects will be stationary after the collision. To determine if a collision
is elastic or inelastic, the total kinetic energy of all of the objects involved in the collision must
be calculated before and after the collision. If the total kinetic energy before and after the
collision is equal, then it is an elastic collision. If the total kinetic energy before the collision
is greater than the total kinetic energy after the collision, then it is an inelastic collision.
Worked example 2B–7 Inelastic collisions

a Show that the momentum of the carts is conserved.
b Show that this collision is inelastic.

a Let movement to the right be positive.
∑ momentum before = (4.5)(0.15) + (−4.5)(0.15) = 0
∑ momentum after = (1.25)(0.15) + (−1.25)(0.15) = 0
Since ∑ momentum before = ∑ momentum after, momentum is conserved.
b Note that while momentum is a vector quantity, kinetic energy is a scalar and so
there are no negatives.

Graphing the change in momentum (impulse)
The area under a force–time graph is the impulse. This can be proven as the area
under any section of a graph is the product of the average y-value and the x-value.
Since the value on the y-axis is the force and the value on the x-axis is the time, the
area under the graph is the product of the average force and the time, which is equal to
the impulse.
Worked example 2B–8 Calculating impulse from a force–time graph
A box is pushed with a force of 75 N for
15 s as shown in the graph on the right.
Calculate the magnitude of the impulse
given to the box in this time.

for the area of triangle.

Equating change in momentum and impulse
The equivalent equations for impulse and change in momentum are shown below:
I = F
av
Δt = Δp = mv – mu
Knowing that impulse and momentum are equal to each other can help you to find the
average force, time, mass, final velocity or initial velocity of an object in a collision. It
is important to recall the units for impulse, N s, and change in momentum, kg m s–1
,
and realise that these two units are interchangeable. It is also useful to recall that the
impulse, and therefore the change in momentum, can be calculated from the area under
a force–time graph.

ENGAGE
A shoe that can make you run 4% faster
On 6 May 2017, Kenyan distance runner, Eliud Kipchoge, attempted what many people
thought was impossible; to run the 42.2 km marathon distance in under two hours. To
do this, he would be required to maintain a speed of 21.1 km h–1. This is equivalent to
running Melbourne’s Tan Track in 10 minutes and 48 seconds, just over 11 times, non-
stop. To help, Eliud wore Nike shoes with improved elastic properties. For almost fifty
years, running shoes had used ethylene vinyl-acetate (EVA) in their midsoles, returning
up to 65% of the runner’s energy as they compress and expand. Nike replaced the
traditional EVA midsole with a new material called Pebax, which was lighter than EVA
and returned up to 87% of the runner’s energy. Another innovation rarely seen at the
time was the use of a carbon-fibre plate that ran the length of the shoe. This plate rocked
the runner onto their toes faster and helped the Pebax to compress and expand quickly.
Various independent studies, as well as running data from the fitness app Strava,
confirmed that the enhanced elastic properties of the shoes can improve running
performance by up to 4%. In his first attempt in 2017, Eliud missed the sub two-hour
mark by just 25 seconds. Other shoe brands released versions with carbon-fibre plates in
them and in the 2020 World Athletics Half Marathon Championships, 92% of the shoes
worn had a carbon-fibre plate in them. Eliud Kipchoge did eventually break the two-hour
marathon in October 2019. However, this was not officially recognised as a world record.

EXPLAIN
Hooke’s law
In order to bend, stretch, twist or compress an object, work must be done on it. If the
object is not damaged, it will return to its original shape once the external force has been
removed. This means that an object is storing energy; this stored energy is known as elastic
potential energy.
If you take three different
springs, A, B and C, and stretch
them all by 0.300 m, it will
require a different amount of
force to stretch each of them to
that length. When the applied
force is plotted against the
Force (N)
extension, a line graph is given.
The graph in red on the right
shows the force applied plotted
against the extension for the
three different springs.

metres (giving the unit N m–1).
The gradient represents the stiffness of the spring and the amount of force require to
stretch the spring by one metre. Since the stiffness of springs will vary, the gradients of the
lines will also vary. A stiffer spring will require more force to stretch it by one metre, so a
stiffer spring will have a steeper gradient. The stiffness of an ideal spring is constant; this
value is known as the spring constant and is given the value k.

Robert Hooke recognised the linear relationship that related the force applied to extend
or compress an ideal spring with the resulting extension or compression of the spring.
He summarised this relationship in what is now known as Hooke’s law, shown in Formula 2C–1.

Compression or extension of the spring (m)
There is a negative sign to indicate that springs restoring force acts in the opposite
direction to the compression or extension. Usually the negative sign can be ignored in
calculations as long as you remain aware of the direction of the forces on the spring and the
direction of the spring’s restoring force. It is worth noting that this relationship holds true
for many objects other than springs that are stretched or compressed.
Worked example 2C–2 Using Hooke’s law
A car drives over a bump in the road and the ideal spring that is used in the car suspension

As we previously learned, the area

is the work done (W = Fs). When
an ideal spring is stretched or
compressed, the force–extension
graph will also give the amount of
work done.
For example, an ideal spring that
has a spring constant of 800 N m–1
is stretched to 1.00 m. The graph

The elastic potential energy in Figure 2C–4 would be

elastic potential energy = 0.5 × 1 × 800

The formula for the elastic potential energy can also
be derived from the graph. The area under the graph
is half the product of the y-value multiplied by the

Extension (m)
Figure 2C–5 As the spring extends, it takes
more and more energy to extend it by the same
amount. The energy required to extend the spring
by 1 m, from 1 m to 2 m, is much less than the
energy required to extend a spring from 4 m to 5 m.
The energy required is indicated by the area
under the graph, highlighted in green.
According to Hooke’s law, F = kx, the more a spring is
extended or compressed, the more force will be required
to continue to extend or compress. For example, to extend
or compress a spring by 1 m when it is originally at its rest
length, does not take as much energy to extend the same
spring by 1 m when it is already extended or compressed.
This is because the more a spring is extended, the greater the
restoring force becomes and therefore more energy must be
applied to overcome this force. This is shown on the graph
in Figure 2C–5, with a spring that has a spring constant of
100 N m–1
.
That progressively more energy is required, at higher degrees
of extension or compression, to extend or compress a spring
by the same amount, can also be proved with Formula 2C–2,
1
the elastic potential energy formula, E
=
kx2. The elastic
s
2
potential energy, E
s, is directly proportional to the extension
or compression squared, x2, which means a change in the
extension will result in a quadratic change in the elastic
potential energy.

So, when finding the change in elastic potential energy, you can either find the area
under the graph or subtract the elastic potential energy of the final length of the spring

will naturally oscillate. During the oscillation, the net force and therefore the acceleration
of the mass that is attached to the spring will always be directed towards point B. Point B
is known as the equilibrium position, it is the point in the system where the net force on the
mass is zero. As the mass moves from point A to B to C and back again, elastic potential
energy and kinetic energy are being constantly transformed into each other. Therefore, the

At point A, the spring has
maximum compression
(shown in the graph in
Figure 2C-7 as negative
extension). At this point
of maximum compression,
the net force and
acceleration will be at a
maximum because the
spring force is at a
maximum.
100% of the energy in the
system will be elastic
potential energy and the
kinetic energy will be zero
as the mass will be
momentarily stationary.
Point B
As the mass accelerates to
point B the elastic potential
energy will decrease and
the kinetic energy will
increase.
When the mass does reach
point B the spring has no
compression or extension,
therefore it will have zero
elastic potential energy. No
spring compression or
extension means no
horizontal spring force on
the mass and therefore no
horizontal acceleration.
Since the mass will no
longer be accelerated in
this direction the velocity
and therefore the kinetic
energy is at a maximum
and contains 100% of the
energy of the system.
Point C
As the mass moves away
from point B towards point C
it will begin to extend.
The extension causes the
spring potential energy to
increase. As the spring
extends the spring force
increases meaning that
the net force and
acceleration will also
increase which slows the
mass down, decreasing the
kinetic energy.
At point C, the spring has
maximum extension which
means 100% of the
systems energy is elastic
potential energy. The net
force and acceleration will
also be at an equal
maximum to point A but in
an opposite direction.
Point C will also be a
momentary stationary
point, meaning the that
the kinetic energy is zero.
From point C the mass will
then move back to point B
and then to point A.

In a vertical spring system, gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy and elastic potential
energy are all being transformed into each other as the spring oscillates. The following

98 CHAPTER 2 FORCE, ENERGY AND MASS
A common example is an ideal spring that has a mass at one end and is attached to a fixed
support at the other end. When the spring is in position A in Figure 2C–9, the spring has no
extension. The mass is then dropped from position A. Assuming that friction is negligible, the
system will oscillate from this top position to a bottom position, C. Note that the 2 m total
extension will change based on the stiffness of the spring and the mass attached to the spring.

Figure 2C–9 A vertical ideal spring with a mass attached will oscillate from its top to bottom
position continually if friction is ignored. Note that the 2 m total extension will change based on
the spring system. Figures 2C–10 and 2C–11 relate to this system.
The net force, acceleration, elastic potential energy, gravitational potential energy and
kinetic energy of the mass will all change throughout the oscillation, and the change in
these quantities can be represented by the graphs shown in Figure 2C–10.

Point A
At point A, the spring is unstretched, meaning that the elastic potential energy is zero. At
point A there is no spring force but there is the force due to gravity on the mass, which
acts to accelerate it down at 9.8 m s–2. At this point the mass is momentarily stationary
meaning that the kinetic energy is zero.
If we take point C to be the point of zero gravitational potential energy, then point A is when
100% of the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy.

Point B
As the mass begins to fall due to the force of gravity, the spring will begin to stretch, hence
the elastic potential energy will increase. As the velocity of the mass is increasing, the
kinetic energy is also increasing and since the height is decreasing, the gravitational
potential energy is also decreasing.
At point B, the mass is in the equilibrium position as the downward force due to gravity is
balanced by the upward spring force (mg = kx). Point B is the point of maximum velocity
and therefore maximum kinetic energy (25% of the total energy). The gravitational
potential energy has now halved.
A
Point C
As the spring moves past point B, the upward spring force becomes greater than the
downwards force due to gravity, meaning the net force and the acceleration is now directed
up. As the spring extends, the upwards net force increases due to an increasing spring
force. Hence, the elastic potential energy will also increase and the velocity will decrease.
At point C, the acceleration will be 9.8 m s–2 up; the spring potential energy will be a
maximum and will account for 100% of the energy of the system. The mass will
momentarily be stationary, meaning that the kinetic energy will be zero and the gravitational
potential energy is defined as zero at this point. The mass will then accelerate to point B.
As is passes point B it will begin to decelerate and become stationary at point A.

Worked example 2C–4 Vertical spring systems
18.0 cm
A spring that has a 1.25 kg mass at one end is
attached to a fixed support and left to oscillate
freely. When oscillating, the maximum
extension in the spring is found to be 18.0 cm.
The diagrams on the right compare the spring
when it is unextended and when it is at a point
of maximum extension.
a On a copy of the diagram showing the spring
when it is unextended, draw all of the forces
acting on the mass.
b Calculate the spring constant of this ideal spring.
c Calculate the maximum velocity of the mass as it is oscillating.
Solution
a Since the spring has no extension, the only force acting on the ball will be the force
due to gravity.
b Take the bottom of the oscillation to be zero gravitational potential energy:
gravitational potential energy at position 1 + elastic potential energy at position 1
+ kinetic energy at position 1 = gravitational potential energy at position 2
+ elastic potential energy at position 2 + kinetic energy at position 2

Understanding graphs
In this course, there are two main elements of
graphs that you need to understand:
• the gradient and area of the graph
• the area under the graph.
The gradient of a graph is the steepness of the
graph; the bigger the gradient, the steeper the
graph. Consider the graph on the right.
To get a sense of the gradient, you can imagine
that the graph is a hill. What would it be like to
walk up and down this graph? Segment AB has
a positive gradient with a moderate steepness,
segment BC has a positive gradient with quite y

a steep (large) gradient. Segment CD is flat and
therefore has a gradient of zero. Segment DE has
a steep (large) negative gradient. The gradient
is calculated by the change in the y-value (∆y)

gradient = Δy

understand how the area under the graph relates to known formulas. For example,
consider the graph above right:

2C SPRINGS

You know that:
W = Fs
So, the work done on the spring, and therefore its stored elastic potential energy, is equal
to the area under a force–extension graph.
Question
A group of students are investigating how the elastic potential energy changes with
the extension of the spring. The students select a spring and extend it by 1 cm, 2 cm,
3 cm, 4 cm and 5 cm and record the average force required to stretch the spring to
each length. The students then multiply the average force by the change in length to
get the elastic potential energy. The students square the extension and plot it on a
graph against the elastic potential energy. The students’ graph is shown below.

COGNITIVE LEVEL: toLevel5 (Analyze & Evaluate)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TARGET: Break down relationships, make judgments, assess validity.
TEST: Can student compare, contrast, infer, critique, or synthesise?
QUESTION TYPES: Compare/contrast, identify relationships, evaluate claims, infer from data, critique reasoning.
STEMS: "Which conclusion is supported by...", "Compare X and Y...", "The evidence suggests...", "Evaluate the claim that..."
REQUIRE: Multi-step reasoning. May include data, scenarios, or competing claims to evaluate.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
