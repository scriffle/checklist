      "correct": "Both require the same time to deflect by the same amount of momentum",
      "correctExplanation": "Deflection depends on impulse (FΔt = Δp). Same momentum change needs the same impulse, so both require the same time at 100 N.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The locomotive, because it has more inertia", "explanation": "While it has more inertia, the deflection time depends on momentum change and force, which are equal." },
        { "answer": "The insect, because it moves much faster", "explanation": "Speed is not the determining factor; momentum and applied force determine deflection time." },

      "question": "In a collision between a small car and a large truck, the truck barely slows while the car stops and reverses. Explain this using inertia and momentum.",
      "correct": "The truck's large inertia resists velocity change; equal momentum changes produce different velocity changes due to different masses",
      "correctExplanation": "Newton's third law gives equal impulses. The truck's large mass means small Δv; the car's small mass means large Δv.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The truck has more momentum so it wins the collision", "explanation": "While true the truck has more momentum, the explanation involves equal forces producing different Δv due to different inertia." },
        { "answer": "The car has no inertia so it bounces easily", "explanation": "All objects with mass have inertia; the car simply has less, leading to a larger velocity change." },
        { "answer": "The truck pushes harder on the car than the car pushes on the truck", "explanation": "Newton's third law states the forces are equal and opposite; the difference is in mass (inertia)." }

      "correct": "Object A (the heavier one) has more momentum",
      "correctExplanation": "If Ek = ½mv² is equal, then p² = 2mEk, so p = √(2mEk). Greater mass gives greater momentum when KE is equal.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Object B (the lighter one) has more momentum", "explanation": "With equal KE, the heavier object has more momentum since p = √(2mEk)." },

      "correctExplanation": "Ball: v = 20 m/s, KE = ½(2)(400) = 400 J. Cart: v = 0.2 m/s, KE = ½(200)(0.04) = 4 J. Ratio = 400:4 = 100:1.",

      "correctExplanation": "Bowling ball KE = ½(5)(36) = 90 J. Tennis ball KE = ½(0.4)(5625) = 1125 J. The tennis ball has 12.5 times more KE concentrated on a smaller impact area.",
