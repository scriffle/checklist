      "why": "This allows you to determine energy transfer in real situations where forces may not act directly along the direction of motion, such as pulling a cart with a rope at an angle.",
      "example": "A person pulls a golf cart 324 m with a force of 250 N at 60° to the horizontal. Work done = 250 × 324 × cos(60°) = 40,500 J",

      "code": "2A.2",
      "what": "When a force acts perpendicular to the direction of motion, no energy is transferred to the object. The component of force parallel to displacement is zero.",
      "why": "This explains why objects in uniform circular motion maintain constant kinetic energy even though a centripetal force acts on them continuously.",

      "example": "A 1500 kg car pushed 12.6 m with 900 N does 11,340 J of work, but if friction is 900 N, all energy becomes thermal energy and kinetic energy remains zero",
