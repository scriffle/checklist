TITLE: I can apply Newton's laws to connected systems including blocks, pulleys, and carriages
CODE: 1A.8

WHAT (concept explanation):
When multiple objects move together as a system, you can add their masses to find the system's acceleration. You then analyse individual objects within the system to find internal forces such as tension in connecting cables or forces between blocks.

WHY (importance):
Many real-world situations involve connected objects, from train carriages to pulley systems. Knowing how to treat them as a single system for acceleration, then isolate parts for internal forces, is a key problem-solving technique.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A 10 kg mass on a frictionless table is connected by a string over a pulley to a hanging 4.5 kg mass. The net force is (4.5)(9.8) = 44.1 N. The system acceleration is 44.1/(10 + 4.5) = 3.04 m/s². The tension in the string is (10)(3.04) = 30.4 N.

SUBTOPIC: Newton's Laws
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers Newton's three laws of motion, including drawing and interpreting free-body diagrams, applying Fnet = ma to calculate acceleration and forces in systems, and identifying action-reaction force pairs. It also extends to inclined planes and vertical motion in lifts.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Newton's laws are the foundation of classical mechanics and are used by engineers and scientists to predict and explain the motion of objects ranging from cars and aircraft to satellites and space probes. Mastering these laws allows you to analyse forces and motion in a wide range of real-world situations.

TOPIC: Newton's Laws of Motion
SUBJECT: Physics | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: This topic covers Newton's three laws of motion applied to systems of forces in one and two dimensions, uniform circular motion in horizontal and vertical planes including banked tracks, and projectile motion near Earth's surface.

TARGET: Basic recall and recognition.
TEST: Can student retrieve relevant knowledge from memory?
QUESTION TYPES: Define terms, identify components, recall facts, match definitions.
STEMS: "What is...", "Which of the following is...", "The term for... is...", "Identify the..."
AVOID: Application, inference, or synthesis. Test recognition, not deeper understanding.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can apply Newton's laws to connected systems including blocks, pulleys, and carriages
CODE: 1A.8

WHAT (concept explanation):
When multiple objects move together as a system, you can add their masses to find the system's acceleration. You then analyse individual objects within the system to find internal forces such as tension in connecting cables or forces between blocks.

WHY (importance):
Many real-world situations involve connected objects, from train carriages to pulley systems. Knowing how to treat them as a single system for acceleration, then isolate parts for internal forces, is a key problem-solving technique.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A 10 kg mass on a frictionless table is connected by a string over a pulley to a hanging 4.5 kg mass. The net force is (4.5)(9.8) = 44.1 N. The system acceleration is 44.1/(10 + 4.5) = 3.04 m/s². The tension in the string is (10)(3.04) = 30.4 N.

SUBTOPIC: Newton's Laws
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers Newton's three laws of motion, including drawing and interpreting free-body diagrams, applying Fnet = ma to calculate acceleration and forces in systems, and identifying action-reaction force pairs. It also extends to inclined planes and vertical motion in lifts.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Newton's laws are the foundation of classical mechanics and are used by engineers and scientists to predict and explain the motion of objects ranging from cars and aircraft to satellites and space probes. Mastering these laws allows you to analyse forces and motion in a wide range of real-world situations.

TOPIC: Newton's Laws of Motion
SUBJECT: Physics | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: This topic covers Newton's three laws of motion applied to systems of forces in one and two dimensions, uniform circular motion in horizontal and vertical planes including banked tracks, and projectile motion near Earth's surface.

COGNITIVE LEVEL: toLevel5 (Analyze & Evaluate)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TARGET: Break down relationships, make judgments, assess validity.
TEST: Can student compare, contrast, infer, critique, or synthesise?
QUESTION TYPES: Compare/contrast, identify relationships, evaluate claims, infer from data, critique reasoning.
STEMS: "Which conclusion is supported by...", "Compare X and Y...", "The evidence suggests...", "Evaluate the claim that..."
REQUIRE: Multi-step reasoning. May include data, scenarios, or competing claims to evaluate.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
