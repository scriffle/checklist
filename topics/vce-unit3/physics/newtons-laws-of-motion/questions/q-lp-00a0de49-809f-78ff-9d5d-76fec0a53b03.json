      "sentence": "On a rotating disc, all points share the same {{blank:1}} velocity, but points further from the centre have greater {{blank:2}} speed.",
      "blanks": {
        "1": {
          "correct": "angular",
          "correctExplanation": "Every point on a rigid rotating disc sweeps through the same angle per unit time, giving uniform angular velocity.",
          "distractors": [
            { "answer": "linear", "explanation": "Linear speed varies with radius on a rotating disc. Points at the edge move faster than points near the centre." },
            { "answer": "tangential", "explanation": "Tangential speed is the same as linear speed and varies with radius. Angular velocity is what remains constant." }

        "2": {
          "correct": "linear",
          "correctExplanation": "From v = r\u03c9, greater radius produces greater linear speed when angular velocity is constant across the disc.",
          "distractors": [
            { "answer": "angular", "explanation": "Angular velocity is the same for all points on a rigid disc. It does not increase with radius." },
            { "answer": "centripetal", "explanation": "While centripetal acceleration does increase with radius, the sentence specifically refers to speed, not acceleration." }
