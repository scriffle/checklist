        { "answer": "Weight (mg) acting downward and a centripetal force directed toward the centre", "explanation": "Centripetal force is not a separate force; it is the net result of the components of the real forces acting on the vehicle." },
        { "answer": "Normal force perpendicular to the surface and a tension force along the banked slope", "explanation": "There is no string or cable attached to the vehicle, so tension does not act. Weight is the other force present." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Vertically upward, directly opposing the weight of the vehicle", "explanation": "This describes the normal force on a flat surface. On a banked track, the surface is tilted, so the normal force is also tilted." },
        { "answer": "Horizontally inward, directed toward the centre of the circular path", "explanation": "Only the horizontal component of the normal force points inward. The full normal force is perpendicular to the banked surface." },

        { "answer": "The angle between the normal force and the banked road surface", "explanation": "The normal force is perpendicular to the surface, so the angle between them is always 90 degrees, not theta." },

      "correct": "Because the horizontal component of the normal force alone provides exactly the centripetal force required",
      "correctExplanation": "At the design speed, N sin theta equals mv squared over r, and N cos theta equals mg. The banking angle is chosen so these conditions are both satisfied without friction.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because the weight of the vehicle is large enough to push it toward the centre of the track", "explanation": "Weight acts vertically downward and does not push the vehicle horizontally. It is the tilted normal force that provides the inward force." },
        { "answer": "Because the centripetal acceleration cancels out the need for any horizontal force on the vehicle", "explanation": "Centripetal acceleration requires a net inward force. It does not cancel the need for force; the normal force component provides it." },

      "question": "What happens to a vehicle on a frictionless banked track if it travels faster than the design speed?",
      "correct": "The vehicle slides up the bank because the required centripetal force exceeds the horizontal component of the normal force",
      "correctExplanation": "At speeds above the design speed, mv squared over r exceeds N sin theta. There is insufficient inward force, so the vehicle drifts outward and up the slope.",
      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Banking reduces air resistance, allowing the aircraft to maintain speed during the turn", "explanation": "Banking is not about drag reduction. The purpose is to redirect a component of the lift force inward to provide centripetal force." },
        { "answer": "Banking shifts the centre of gravity inward, pulling the aircraft toward the centre of the turn", "explanation": "The centre of gravity does not shift. Banking tilts the lift force vector so that a horizontal component provides the inward force." },
        { "answer": "Banking increases the total lift force, which is needed to overcome the extra weight felt during a turn", "explanation": "While more lift is needed, the primary reason for banking is to create a horizontal centripetal component, not just to increase total lift." }
