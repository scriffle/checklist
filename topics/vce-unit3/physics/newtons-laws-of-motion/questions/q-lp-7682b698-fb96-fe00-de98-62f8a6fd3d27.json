      "question": "What does Newton's third law state about forces between two interacting objects?",
      "correct": "Every action force has an equal and opposite reaction force",
      "correctExplanation": "Newton's third law states that when object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on object A.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Every force is balanced by a friction force of equal size", "explanation": "Friction is one type of force, not a universal reaction. Newton's third law applies to all force interactions, not just friction." },
        { "answer": "Action and reaction forces cancel out to give zero net force", "explanation": "Third-law pairs act on different objects, so they do not cancel. Forces cancel only when acting on the same object." },
        { "answer": "A force only produces a reaction when it causes acceleration", "explanation": "The reaction force always exists regardless of whether acceleration occurs. Third-law pairs are present in all interactions." }

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "In Newton's third law, where do the action and reaction forces act?",
      "correct": "They act on two different objects involved in the interaction",
      "correctExplanation": "The action force acts on one object while the reaction force acts on the other object. Third-law pairs always involve two separate bodies.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "They both act on the same object at the same location", "explanation": "If both forces acted on the same object they would cancel. Third-law pairs always act on different objects." },
        { "answer": "They act on the same object but at two different points", "explanation": "Third-law forces are not applied at different points on one body. Each force of the pair acts on a separate object." },
        { "answer": "One acts on an object and the other acts on the surrounding air", "explanation": "The reaction force acts on the object that exerts the action force, not on the surrounding medium." }

      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Which convention is used to label a Newton's third law force pair?",
      "correct": "Force on A by B, paired with force on B by A",
      "correctExplanation": "The convention 'force on A by B' identifies which object experiences the force and which object exerts it, making the pair clear.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Force of A plus B, paired with force of A minus B", "explanation": "Addition and subtraction of labels is not used. The convention names the object acted on and the object exerting the force." },
        { "answer": "Force at A towards B, paired with force at B towards A", "explanation": "Third-law forces are directed away from each other, not towards each other. The naming convention identifies objects, not directions." },
        { "answer": "Net force on A, paired with net force on B in the system", "explanation": "Net force sums all forces on one object. Third-law pairs identify individual interaction forces, not net forces." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The larger object always exerts a greater magnitude force", "explanation": "Mass does not determine which force is larger. Third-law pairs are always equal in magnitude regardless of object size." },
        { "answer": "They are equal only when neither object is accelerating", "explanation": "Third-law pairs are equal at all times, whether the objects accelerate or not. Equality is not conditional on motion." },
