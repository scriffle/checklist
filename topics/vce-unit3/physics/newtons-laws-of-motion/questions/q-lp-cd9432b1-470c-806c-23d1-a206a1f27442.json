        { "answer": "Away from the centre of the loop, which is downward", "explanation": "Students may confuse normal force direction with weight. The normal force always pushes away from the contact surface, which is upward at the bottom." },
        { "answer": "Tangent to the circular path in the forward direction", "explanation": "The normal force is perpendicular to the surface, not tangent to the path. Tangential forces change speed, not direction." },
