      "correct": "Gravity alone provides all of the centripetal force",
      "correctExplanation": "At the minimum speed the normal force (or tension) drops to zero, so the only force acting toward the centre is the weight of the object.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The normal force alone provides the centripetal force", "explanation": "At minimum speed the normal force is zero. Students confuse the minimum-speed case with the general case where normal force contributes." },
        { "answer": "Friction between the object and the track provides the force", "explanation": "Friction acts along the track surface, not toward the centre. Centripetal force at the top comes from gravity and the normal force." },
        { "answer": "The object's inertia provides the centripetal force needed", "explanation": "Inertia is not a force. It is the tendency of the object to continue in a straight line, not a source of centripetal force." }

      "correct": "v_min = √(gr)",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "v_min = √(2gr)", "explanation": "The factor of 2 does not appear in the minimum speed derivation. Students may confuse this with energy conservation expressions." },
        { "answer": "v_min = √(g/r)", "explanation": "This inverts the radius term. The correct relationship is v² = gr, not v² = g/r." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The normal force equals the weight of the object", "explanation": "When the normal force equals the weight, the net centripetal force is 2mg, which corresponds to a speed above the minimum." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The radius of the loop", "explanation": "Radius appears in the formula v_min = √(gr). A larger loop requires a higher minimum speed at the top." },

      "correct": "The object loses contact with the track and falls away from the circular path",
      "correctExplanation": "Below the minimum speed, gravity provides more force than needed for circular motion at that radius, so the object follows a tighter path and leaves the track.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The object continues on the circular path but decelerates gradually", "explanation": "The object cannot maintain contact with the track when gravity exceeds the required centripetal force at the given speed." },
