      "correct": "Friction must act down the slope, providing extra centripetal force of mv\u00b2/r \u2212 mg tan(\u03b8) per unit mass",
      "correctExplanation": "At 35 m/s, the required centripetal force mv\u00b2/r exceeds mg tan(\u03b8). Friction must act down the slope (toward the centre) to supply the deficit.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Friction must act up the slope, reducing the centripetal force to match the available normal force", "explanation": "At speeds above design speed, more centripetal force is needed, not less. Friction acts down the slope to add centripetal force." },
        { "answer": "No additional force is needed because the normal force automatically adjusts to match any vehicle speed", "explanation": "On a fixed-geometry track, the normal force is determined by equilibrium. It cannot simply increase to match arbitrary speeds without friction." },

      "correctExplanation": "The derivation assumes no friction. With friction, additional horizontal force components change the net centripetal force, and Fnet \u2260 mg tan(\u03b8).",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Student A is correct; friction simply adds to the centripetal force without changing the formula", "explanation": "Friction changes the force balance. The net centripetal force becomes mg tan(\u03b8) plus or minus the friction component, not just mg tan(\u03b8)." },
        { "answer": "Both are correct; the formula works with friction if you replace g with the effective gravitational value", "explanation": "There is no simple replacement for g that accounts for friction. The full friction force must be resolved into components and added to the equations." },

        { "answer": "The new angle is the same as the original because the design speed has not changed from 20 m/s", "explanation": "The angle depends on both speed and radius. Changing the radius while keeping speed constant requires a different banking angle." },
