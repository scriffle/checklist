        "1": {
          "correct": "ratio",
          "correctExplanation": "Dividing numerator and denominator by m gives g/(1 + M/m), which depends solely on the ratio M/m, not the individual magnitudes.",
          "distractors": [
            { "answer": "difference", "explanation": "The acceleration formula involves a ratio M/m, not a difference. Doubling both masses leaves the acceleration unchanged." },
            { "answer": "sum", "explanation": "While the sum appears in the original denominator, the rewritten form shows that the ratio M/m is the determining factor." }

          "correct": "individual",
          "correctExplanation": "Systems with the same mass ratio (e.g., 10 kg and 5 kg versus 20 kg and 10 kg) have the same acceleration, regardless of the individual mass values.",
          "distractors": [
            { "answer": "combined", "explanation": "The combined mass matters in the original form, but the key insight is that only the ratio determines acceleration, not individual values." },
