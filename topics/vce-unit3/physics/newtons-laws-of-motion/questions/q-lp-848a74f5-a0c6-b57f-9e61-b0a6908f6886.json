      "question": "A car travels around a frictionless banked curve. How does increasing the banking angle affect the design speed of the curve if the radius stays constant?",
      "correct": "The design speed increases because tan θ increases with the banking angle",

        { "answer": "The aircraft increases its engine thrust to provide centripetal force during the banking turn", "explanation": "Engine thrust acts along the direction of travel, not toward the centre of the turn. The centripetal force comes from the tilted lift." },
