  "what": "This subtopic covers Newton's three laws of motion, including drawing and interpreting free-body diagrams, applying Fnet = ma to calculate acceleration and forces in systems, and identifying action-reaction force pairs. It also extends to inclined planes and vertical motion in lifts.",
  "why": "Newton's laws are the foundation of classical mechanics and are used by engineers and scientists to predict and explain the motion of objects ranging from cars and aircraft to satellites and space probes. Mastering these laws allows you to analyse forces and motion in a wide range of real-world situations.",

      "title": "I can apply Newton's first law to determine whether a net force is acting on a body",
      "code": "1A.1",
      "what": "Newton's first law states that an object at rest or moving at constant velocity will remain in that state unless acted upon by an unbalanced (net) force. This is also called the law of inertia, where inertia is a body's resistance to changes in motion and depends only on mass.",
      "why": "Understanding the first law helps you recognise that constant velocity means balanced forces and that any change in motion requires a net force. This is essential for correctly analysing real-world situations.",
      "example": "A car travelling at a constant velocity on a straight road has balanced forces: the driving force from the road equals the combined air resistance and rolling resistance. Since the forces are balanced, the car maintains its velocity.",

      "title": "I can draw and interpret free-body diagrams showing all forces acting on a body",
      "code": "1A.2",
      "what": "A free-body diagram shows the relative magnitude and direction of all forces acting on a single object. Forces are drawn as arrows originating from the object, with arrow length proportional to force magnitude.",
      "why": "Free-body diagrams are the starting point for solving almost every force and motion problem. They allow you to identify all forces, determine the net force, and apply Newton's second law correctly.",
      "example": "For a box on a slope inclined at 34 degrees, the free-body diagram shows three forces: the weight (mg) acting vertically downward, the normal force perpendicular to the slope surface, and friction acting parallel to the slope opposing motion.",

      "title": "I can apply Newton's second law using Fnet = ma to calculate acceleration or force",
      "code": "1A.3",
      "what": "Newton's second law states that the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass. The formula Fnet = ma allows you to calculate the acceleration of a system or the net force acting on it.",
      "why": "This law provides the quantitative link between force and motion. It is used in nearly every dynamics calculation, from determining how quickly a vehicle accelerates to finding the tension in a cable.",
      "example": "A 66 000 kg aircraft has a forward thrust of 350 kN and a backward frictional force of 300 kN. The net force is 50 kN forward. Using a = Fnet/m = 50 000/66 000 = 0.756 m/s² forward.",

      "title": "I can resolve forces into components and calculate the net force when forces act at angles",
      "code": "1A.4",
      "what": "When forces act at angles, you resolve them into horizontal and vertical components using trigonometry (sin and cos). The net force in each direction is then found by adding the components in that direction.",
      "why": "Most real-world force situations involve forces acting at different angles. Being able to resolve and combine these components is essential for solving problems involving ropes at angles, inclined planes, and two-dimensional motion.",
      "example": "A 3 kg block is pulled by a 30 N force at 27 degrees to the horizontal against a 20 N friction force. The horizontal net force is 30 cos(27) - 20 = 6.73 N. The horizontal acceleration is 6.73/3 = 2.24 m/s².",

      "code": "1A.5",
      "what": "On an inclined plane, the normal force is N = mg cos(theta) and the gravitational component parallel to the slope is Fds = mg sin(theta). On a frictionless slope, the acceleration is a = g sin(theta).",
      "why": "Inclined plane problems appear frequently in physics and engineering. Understanding how gravity splits into components on a slope lets you predict whether an object will slide and how fast it will accelerate.",
      "example": "A 15 kg box on a 34 degree slope has a normal force of (15)(9.8)(cos 34) = 122 N and a gravitational force down the slope of (15)(9.8)(sin 34) = 82.2 N.",

      "title": "I can apply Newton's third law to identify action-reaction force pairs",
      "code": "1A.6",
      "what": "Newton's third law states that every action force has an equal and opposite reaction force. These two forces always act on different bodies and are described using the convention 'force on A by B', where Fon A by B = -Fon B by A.",
      "why": "Correctly identifying third-law pairs prevents common errors such as confusing the normal force with the reaction to gravity. It is essential for understanding how objects interact and for solving multi-body problems.",
      "example": "A person standing on a rope exerts a downward force on the rope. By Newton's third law, the rope exerts an equal upward force (the normal force) on the person. These are an action-reaction pair because they act on different objects.",

      "title": "I can calculate the normal force on a person in a lift accelerating vertically",
      "code": "1A.7",
      "what": "When a person is in a lift, the normal force changes depending on the lift's acceleration. The formula N = m(a_vertical + g) gives the normal force, where upward acceleration increases it and downward acceleration decreases it.",
      "why": "This application connects Newton's second law to the everyday experience of feeling heavier or lighter in a lift. It also demonstrates that the normal force is not always equal to weight.",
      "example": "A 72 kg person in a lift accelerating upward at 0.15 m/s² has a normal force of N = 72(0.15 + 9.8) = 716 N, which is more than their stationary weight of 706 N.",

      "title": "I can apply Newton's laws to connected systems including blocks, pulleys, and carriages",
      "code": "1A.8",
      "what": "When multiple objects move together as a system, you can add their masses to find the system's acceleration. You then analyse individual objects within the system to find internal forces such as tension in connecting cables or forces between blocks.",
      "why": "Many real-world situations involve connected objects, from train carriages to pulley systems. Knowing how to treat them as a single system for acceleration, then isolate parts for internal forces, is a key problem-solving technique.",
      "example": "A 10 kg mass on a frictionless table is connected by a string over a pulley to a hanging 4.5 kg mass. The net force is (4.5)(9.8) = 44.1 N. The system acceleration is 44.1/(10 + 4.5) = 3.04 m/s². The tension in the string is (10)(3.04) = 30.4 N.",
