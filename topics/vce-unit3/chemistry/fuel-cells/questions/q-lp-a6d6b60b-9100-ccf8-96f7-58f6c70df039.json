        "2": {
          "correct": "dry out",
          "correctExplanation": "A dry membrane has poor proton conductivity because water is needed to transport H⁺ ions. This increases resistance and reduces cell performance.",

              "answer": "dissolve",
              "explanation": "Membranes do not dissolve from low water. They dry out, losing the proton conductivity needed for cell operation."

              "answer": "expand",
              "explanation": "Expansion occurs with water uptake, not water loss. Insufficient water causes the membrane to dry out and lose conductivity."

              "answer": "electrode colour",

          "correct": "electron",
          "correctExplanation": "If electron transport (limited by conductivity) is the bottleneck, maintaining higher conductivity material may be more important than extra surface area.",

              "explanation": "Photon transport is not relevant to fuel cells. The trade-off is between surface area for reactions and conductivity for electron flow."
