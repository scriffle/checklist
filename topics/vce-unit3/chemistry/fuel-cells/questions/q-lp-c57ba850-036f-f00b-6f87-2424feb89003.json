      "correct": "Direct mixing would cause combustion or waste energy as heat instead of generating electricity",
      "correctExplanation": "If fuel and oxidant mixed directly, they could react chemically (combustion) rather than electrochemically. This would release energy as heat instead of producing useful electrical energy through the external circuit.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Direct mixing would corrode the electrodes", "explanation": "While corrosion can be an issue, the primary reason for separating fuel and oxidant is to force the reaction through the electrochemical pathway, generating electricity rather than just heat." },

        { "answer": "Direct mixing would produce toxic gases", "explanation": "In a hydrogen fuel cell, direct mixing produces water and heat, not toxic gases. The issue is the loss of electrical energy when the reaction bypasses the electrochemical pathway." }

        { "answer": "Electrons leak through the holes instead of the external circuit", "explanation": "Electrons do not flow through the electrolyte, even through holes. The issue is that reactant gases cross through the holes, allowing direct chemical reaction instead of electrochemical conversion." },

      "correctExplanation": "PEM cells use polymer membranes that conduct protons well at low temperatures but would decompose at 800°C. Solid oxide cells use ceramic electrolytes that only conduct oxide ions effectively at very high temperatures but are impractical at 80°C.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both could use the same electrolyte but manufacturers choose different ones for cost reasons", "explanation": "The electrolyte choice is dictated by operating temperature, not cost alone.
