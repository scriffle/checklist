Which is more sustainable?","correct":"Corn starch, because it can be regrown annually","correctExplanation":"Over 20 years, corn can provide 20 harvests. Natural gas reserves deplete with extraction and cannot be replaced, making corn starch more sustainable.","distractors":[{"answer":"Natural gas, because it has higher energy density","explanation":"Energy density does not determine sustainability. Natural gas depletes over time while corn starch is regrown each year."},{"answer":"Both are equally sustainable over 20 years","explanation":"Corn starch is renewed annually while natural gas reserves shrink. They are not equally sustainable over any timeframe."},{"answer":"Natural gas, because it is easier to transport","explanation":"Transport ease does not define sustainability.
