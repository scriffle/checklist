Option C is a 60% efficient fuel cell with CHP at 85% total efficiency. Which option minimises environmental impact per unit of useful energy?",
      "correct": "Option C, because it extracts the most useful energy from each unit of fuel",
      "correctExplanation": "Option C achieves 85% total efficiency by capturing waste heat, meaning only 15% of the input energy is wasted. This minimises fuel consumption and emissions per unit of useful energy, providing the lowest environmental impact.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Option A, because diesel generators are simpler to maintain", "explanation": "Maintenance simplicity does not determine environmental impact per unit of useful energy. Option C's 85% efficiency far exceeds the diesel's 35%, meaning much less fuel is needed for the same useful energy." },
        { "answer": "Option B, because fuel cells always have zero emissions", "explanation": "While hydrogen fuel cells produce only water at point of use, the environmental impact also depends on efficiency. Option C is better because it captures waste heat, reducing total fuel consumption further." },
        { "answer": "All three are equivalent because they produce the same type of energy", "explanation": "The type of energy produced is the same, but the efficiency differs dramatically. Option C uses the least fuel and produces the least waste per unit of useful energy." }

      "correct": "300 kJ electrical energy and 200 kJ lost as heat",
      "correctExplanation": "Electrical energy = 500 × 0.60 = 300 kJ. Energy lost = 500 - 300 = 200 kJ. At 60% efficiency, 40% of the input energy is lost, primarily as heat.",

      "correct": "It depends, because the CHP system provides both electricity and heat, which must be compared with the combined efficiency of separate electricity and heating systems",
      "correctExplanation": "A direct comparison of 85% vs 90% is misleading because the CHP provides both electricity and heat.

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Yes, because 85% is very close to 90% and fuel cells are always better", "explanation": "The 85% CHP efficiency produces both electricity and heat, while the 90% boiler only produces heat. These cannot be compared directly without considering the electricity benefit." },
        { "answer": "No, because the boiler is more efficient at 90% versus 85%", "explanation": "Comparing 90% thermal-only efficiency with 85% combined electricity-and-heat efficiency is misleading. The CHP provides additional electricity that would otherwise need a separate source." },
