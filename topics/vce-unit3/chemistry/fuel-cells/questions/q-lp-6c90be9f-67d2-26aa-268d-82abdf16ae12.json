        "1": {
          "correct": "continuous",
          "correctExplanation": "Fuel cells generate power continuously as long as fuel and oxidant are supplied externally, making them suitable for long-term applications.",

            {
              "answer": "stored",

              "answer": "intermittent",
              "explanation": "Fuel cells provide continuous, not intermittent, power. Their steady output is what makes them suitable for long-term use."

            {
              "answer": "renewable",
              "explanation": "Primary cell reactants are not renewable. They are consumed irreversibly, and the cell must be discarded when depleted."

            {
              "answer": "unlimited",

        "1": {

              "answer": "any",

        "2": {
          "correct": "enclosed",
          "correctExplanation": "In enclosed spaces, harmful exhaust gases from combustion engines accumulate to dangerous levels. Fuel cells are safe because they emit only water vapour.",

            {
              "answer": "outdoor",
              "explanation": "The concern is primarily about enclosed spaces where gases accumulate. Outdoor spaces allow pollutants to disperse more readily."
