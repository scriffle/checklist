FUEL CELLS
Introduction
Fuel cells are already used to provide clean, quiet and efficient energy and are
likely to continue to be developed further as a means of meeting our future
energy needs. Globally, there are rockets, buses and cars already using fuel
cells to power them. It is likely that this means of energy production will
become more prominent, as fossil fuels are phased out and technology continues to
develop, allowing for cheaper, more sustainable and renewable ways to generate the
reactants used in fuel cells. In this chapter, you will discover how fuel cells operate and
explore many of the key design features that allow for efficient and safe storage, as well
as how they are a key component in helping to meet the future energy needs of society.

Fuel cell electric vehicles
Electric cars are becoming more and more common, such as those made by Tesla. Tesla
make battery-powered vehicles, in which the battery stores up energy (via charging) that
is then used to power the electric motor. Another type of electric car is also available: the
fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). In FCEVs, such as the Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo,
hydrogen and oxygen combine in the fuel cell to generate electricity. Compared
to batteries, which take considerable time to charge, FCEVs can be refuelled in less than
four minutes. They can also travel further on average than battery-powered vehicles,
which is often one of the main reasons people are reluctant to switch to electric cars.
So why are FCEVs so much less popular? One of the biggest problems is that of
infrastructure. While hydrogen fuel cells have had plenty of success in powering non-
consumer engines, such as those of space shuttles and aircraft, their use in daily life is
limited by the need for vehicle refuelling stations to be common and easily accessible.
Currently, it is simply too costly and difficult to implement such infrastructure
compared to battery-charging stations. If hydrogen could be more readily available, and
sourced renewably, FCEVs could become much more common.

HOW DO FUEL
CELLS WORK?
EXPLAIN
Fuel cells
Fuel cells work in a similar way to other types of galvanic cells (which were discussed in
Section 3C), using spontaneous reactions to convert chemical energy into electrical energy.
Unlike primary galvanic cells, which eventually reach a state of equilibrium and no longer
produce electrical energy, fuel cells are a type of galvanic cell that do not store the reactants
in the cell. Instead, the reactants must be supplied from an external source. The huge
advantage of this is that the fuel cells are able to produce a continuous supply of electricity,
provided the supply of reactants into the cell is maintained. As well as this, they do not
require recharging like secondary cells do.
There are many different types of fuel cell, including the hydrogen-fuelled polymer
electrolyte membrane (also known as a proton exchange membrane or PEM) fuel cell,
methanol fuel cells, alkaline fuel cells (such as potassium hydroxide cells), phosphoric
acid fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells. Regardless of the type of fuel cell, they share many
advantages, such as:
• They have higher efficiency than coal-fired power stations or combustion car engines.
This is because they directly convert chemical energy into electrical energy, rather
than relying on a number of energy transformation steps, which ultimately result in a
decrease in efficiency.
• They are relatively quiet when operating and the products of the reactions are generally
more environmentally friendly.
• Unlike other galvanic cells, the fuels used are not stored in the cell itself and so must
be generated and supplied from an external source. However, provided that there is a
constant supply of reactants, fuel cells are able to sustain long-term continuous energy
production (without needing to be recharged or replaced regularly).
• Catalysts and modifications to electrode design can be used to increase the rate
of reaction.
• Fuel cells are portable. Although they can’t necessarily be packaged into small battery-
sized compartments, their ability to produce electricity directly where it is needed makes
them suitable for use in vehicles, including space shuttles.
• There are a range of reactants that are suitable for use in fuel cells.
• They also generate heat, which can be used to minimise energy needs to fulfill heating
requirements.
Design features of fuel cells
Each fuel cell has similar design features, including:
• an anode and cathode, separated by an electrolyte
• inlets that allow for the continuous supply of fuel
• inlets that supply the other reactants for the reactions
• outlets for the products to leave the cell
• an external circuit where electrons flow as electrical energy is produced.
These features can be seen in Figure 4A–2 on the following page.

FEATURES OF
FUEL CELLS
Fuel cells often have design features that enhance the efficiency of the cells. Some of these
include:
• the use of catalytic electrodes to speed up the reactions taking place. One such example is
the use of powdered platinum anodes that help break fuel molecules into electrons and
ions. Another example is the use of a nickel cathode, which catalyses the conversion of
excess ions into water molecules.
• oxidation-resistant gas diffusion layers made from carbon-based materials. These
maintain an optimal flow rate of reactant gases and also ensure minimal water retention
within the cell, which can reduce the power being generated by the cell.
• porous electrodes to increase the effective surface area of the electrode, enhancing the
ability for gaseous reactants to diffuse through them easily and react with the ions
present in the electrolyte solution of the cell. This also distributes the current more
evenly within the electrode, improving the efficiency of the cell.
Sustainability and environmental considerations
With the current challenges of meeting society’s energy needs, there is more emphasis
than ever on researching and exploring innovative ways to design fuel cells in a way that
increases energy efficiency and minimises fuel consumption. Currently, fuel cells are used
mainly for space exploration, vehicle transportation and stationary power generation, the
latter of which can be configured to provide both heat and power. Using fuel cells in this
way improves energy efficiency as, in addition to the electrical energy that the cells produce,
the heat from the fuel cells can be used to generate hot water and low-pressure steam.
An absorption chiller can also be employed to use otherwise wasted energy to produce
chilled water.

134 CHAPTER 4 FUEL CELLS
One of the most discussed fuel cells to improve the environmental impact of energy
production is the hydrogen fuel cell. While there are many potential applications where
hydrogen fuel cells may prove to be useful, there is particular interest in how they could be
implemented in cars.
Figure 4A–3 Cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells may produce less than 50% of
the greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles currently running on petrol.
Hydrogen fuel cells have the same basic structure as other fuel cells but specifically have
hydrogen as the input. Importantly, the ‘waste’ products that are generated from these
fuel cells are heat and water (Figure 4A–4). As mentioned earlier, not only are these more
environmentally friendly than the outputs of traditional engines, but they can be useful to
help drive other processes.

According to a report by the United States Government Department of Energy, these fuel
cell-powered vehicles have the following benefits:
• They can generate energy with an efficiency of around 60%, whereas conventional petrol
engines are less than 20% efficient.
• Using natural gas as a source of hydrogen, these vehicles would have total greenhouse
gas emissions that are less than 50% of those produced by current vehicles.

135
As mentioned, as well as the improved efficiency, fuel cells use natural gas, or better still,
biogas or biomass, which can be re-formed into hydrogen. It is the hydrogen that then reacts
in the fuel cell to provide the electrical energy. Biogas can be generated from renewable
feedstocks, such as corn starch, switchgrass and soybean oil, as well as food scraps and
animal waste. However, classification of what is considered renewable can be debated.
There are huge advantages to the use of this material to produce energy. It is estimated that
every year in the United States alone, there could be up to one trillion kilograms of biomass
available for energy use. Biomass is converted to hydrogen gas, and other products, through
a process known as gasification.

The utilisation of organic and renewable feedstocks is one of the most important and
significant challenges that chemists face in the world today as society moves to eliminate
the use of non-renewable carbon resources such as coal, oil and natural gas. However,
our conceptions of what feedstocks should be considered renewable is still developing. In
December 2022, Australia became the first major economy to exclude native forest biomass
from being considered a renewable energy source. This is different from other regions,
such as the European Union (EU), which significantly relies on ‘woody biomass’ (the term
for trees and woody plants) to meet its renewable energy targets. Only time will tell if this
leads to any further global shift in the understanding of renewability, but regardless, there
will continue to be innovation and developments in the drive to produce fuel cells that are
designed to run more efficiently on affordable, scalable and sustainable fuels that have low
emissions to make them more environmentally friendly.

Using tables for comparison
In Section 1A, the Skills section described important things to remember when writing
answers that require you to perform a comparison. To expand on these comments,
another useful technique when writing answers that involve a comparison is the use of a
table. Using a table is a really helpful method for ensuring that you illustrate your answer
clearly and cover all of the required points.
As an example, based on the material covered in this section, you could reasonably
expect to receive a question that asked the following:
Question: Compare the features and function of primary galvanic cells and fuel cells.
Answer: Instead of answering this as a paragraph of text, you may find it suits you better
to use a table. There are a couple of different ways that you could structure your tables.
Firstly, as shown below, you could have one column for galvanic cells and one column
for fuel cells. Each line in the table could then be used to describe a specific aspect, such
as the overall purpose, which has been filled in already. Any differences between the two
regarding that aspect would be highlighted by the text in each column.
Primary galvanic cells Fuel cells
Convert or make the header row singular
chemical energy into electrical energy

Secondly, as shown below, you could set up your table in a way that has a column for
similarities and a column for differences. This allows you to specifically highlight the
aspects in common and those that differ, but it doesn’t necessarily align them by an
overall theme.
Similarities Differences
Either method is effective, and it is important to work out what suits you personally. For
revision, you may wish to fill in the tables above with the information you have learned
so far.

Who was Faraday?
Michael Faraday, born in 1791, was a scientist who made incredible discoveries in the
fields of chemistry and physics. He discovered several organic compounds, including
bicarburet of hydrogen (which we now call benzene), and many of his scientific
contributions laid the foundations for electromagnetic field theory. In this section,
we will look at two laws described by Faraday in 1833. These laws directly relate the
amount of reactant or product formed over time in an electrochemical cell with the
electric charge that runs through it. In commercial chemistry, where large amounts of
compounds need to be generated with a level of exactness, being able to apply these
laws is particularly significant. In this section, you will learn how to perform calculations
related to galvanic and fuel cells using Faraday’s laws.

It is important to be able to control or predict the outcomes in electrochemical cells. For
example, how much metal will be deposited at the cathode? How much reactant is needed
to produce a certain amount of electrical energy? How long will the cell operate for?

the amount of
charge that 1

carries (F =

To help understand how the number of electrons flowing through a circuit can be related
to the mass of the reactants consumed or products formed, we first need to understand
Faraday’s laws which state the following:
1 The mass of a substance (m) produced or consumed at an electrode is directly
proportional (∝) to the electric charge (Q) (m ∝ Q).
2 The amounts, in moles, of different substances produced or consumed at electrodes by
the passage of the same amount of electricity are inversely proportional to the charges
1
on their ions (n ∝
ionic charge).
3 Electric charge is measured in coulombs and is represented by the symbol, Q. The
amount of charge that 1 mole of electrons has is 96 500 coulombs (C). This amount is
known as Faraday’s constant, F, and can be written as:
F = 96 500 C mol–1
This relationship can be expressed through the equation:
Q = n(e–) × F
where:
Q = The electric charge (in coulombs)
n(e–) = The number of moles of electrons
F = Faraday’s constant (96 500 C mol–1)
Current and time
Current (I) is the rate that electric charge flows through a circuit during a certain period
of time and is measured in amperes or amps (A). One ampere is equal to one coulomb of
charge per second:
Current
the rate at which
electrons flow
within a circuit
Ampere
the unit used
for measuring
electric current;
also known
as amp
1 ampere (A) = 1 coulomb (C) per second (s)
1 A = 1 C s–1
The current flowing in an electrochemical cell will be directly proportional to the charge.
Put simply, the higher the current running through the cell, the more electrons passing
through the circuit, and the greater the amount of products formed. For example, if twice
the current is produced over a certain amount of time, then twice as many moles of the
products will be formed. Similarly, twice as much of the reactants will be consumed.
The time, t, for which a cell is operating is measured in seconds and is also directly
proportional to the charge. Put simply, the longer a cell operates, the more electrons pass
through the circuit and the greater the amount of products formed.
These factors are represented by the following relationship:
Q = I t
where:
Q = The electric charge (in coulombs)
I = The current (in amperes)
t = The time (in seconds).
NOTE
There is often a need to convert units from seconds to other units of time, and vice versa.
It is worth spending time familiarising yourself with the conversion steps needed for such
calculations.

4B FARADAY’S LAWS
139
Calculations using Faraday’s laws and stoichiometry
For a galvanic or fuel cell, the chemical reactions that occur are spontaneous, so that once
the cell is connected electrical current will travel through the external circuit. An ammeter
can be used to measure the current over time and subsequently determine the total charge
that flows through the external circuit. Once this is known, the moles of electrons can
be calculated and using the half equations for the reactions taking place, it is possible to
determine how many moles of reactants have been consumed and/or how many moles of
product are formed.

140 CHAPTER 4 FUEL CELLS
Charge of the ion
Consider a galvanic cell with one half-cell containing Na+ ions that will be reduced at the
cathode to sodium metal, as follows:
Na+(aq) + e–
→ Na(s)
For every 1 mole of electrons flowing though the cell, 1 mole of sodium metal is produced.
However, now consider a different galvanic cell with the half-cell containing Mg2+ ions
reacting at the cathode as follows:
Mg2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Mg(s)
In this reaction, to produce 1 mole of magnesium metal, there are 2 moles of electrons
required, twice as many as were needed for sodium.
Lastly, imagine a galvanic cell with a half-cell containing Al3+ ions reacting at the cathode as
follows:
Al3+(aq) + 3e–
→ Al(s)
In this reaction, to produce 1 mole of aluminium metal, there are 3 moles of electrons
required, three times as many as were needed for sodium.
As mentioned earlier, this relationship can be represented by the following equation:
Q = n(e–) × F
Simply put, the larger the charge on the ion, the smaller the amount of that species will
react or be produced during the reaction.

Step 1 Identify the reduction half-equation (as 0.95
grams are being deposited, not reacted), using
the electrochemical series.
Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Ni(s)
Step 2 Calculate the moles of nickel using n =
m
M n(Ni) = m
M
n(Ni) = 0.95 g
58.7 g mol–1
n(Ni) = 0.016 mol
Step 3 Determine the mole ratio of electrons to
solid nickel.
n(e–) : n(Ni) = 2 : 1
Step 4 Calculate the moles of electrons using the
mole ratio.
n(e–) = n(Ni) × 2
n(e–) = 0.016 × 2
n(e–) = 0.032 mol
Step 5 Calculate the charge using Faraday’s constant. Q = n(e–) × F
Q = 0.032 mol × 96 500
Q = 3124 C
Step 6 Rearrange Q = It to solve for I. Q = It
Q
I =
t

I =
(15 × 60)
I = 3.5 amps

4B SKILLS
Units and unit conversion
In this section, you have seen that in calculations you may be dealing with many
different units: coulombs, amperes, grams, seconds, minutes, moles etc. It is important
that you are confident with the unit that is associated with every aspect of your
calculations, as you should make it a habit to include them in all your working-out steps
and, even more importantly, in your final answer. An answer without units provided,
assuming they are required, is meaningless and may not receive any marks.
In a similar fashion, it is also important to pay close attention to the units that are
required for the answer. A common example of this is found when using the Q = I t
equation, where the question may require you to provide an answer for the time in
minutes. As you may remember, the expression involves time in seconds. Therefore, in
questions such as this, you will need to divide the answer that you get by 60 to end up
with an answer in the appropriate units.
Section 4B questions
1 Nickel ions undergo reduction to solid nickel at the cathode of a particular galvanic cell.
Determine how long it will take to deposit 2.00 grams of nickel in a galvanic cell if a
current of 1.85 amps is applied to the cell, to the nearest minute.
2 Solid copper undergoes oxidation to copper(II) ions at the anode in a galvanic cell.
Determine the mass of copper lost if 1.2 amps of current is running through the cell for
12.0 minutes.
3 Determine the amount of current running through a fuel cell if 11.65 grams of silver at
the cathode are deposited after 2.50 hours. The reaction occurring at the cathode is:
Ag+(aq) + e–
→ Ag(s)
4 Hearing aids are often powered by alkaline batteries that last for 1200 hours. The half-
reactions occurring in an alkaline battery are:
Zn(s) + 2OH−(aq) → ZnO(s) + H2O(l) + 2e−
2MnO2(s) + H2O(l) + 2e−
→ Mn2O3(s) + 2OH−(aq)
If a hearing aid uses 1 mA of current, calculate the mass of zinc reacting during its
lifetime. Assume the current remains constant.

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

FUEL CELLS
Introduction
Fuel cells are already used to provide clean, quiet and efficient energy and are
likely to continue to be developed further as a means of meeting our future
energy needs. Globally, there are rockets, buses and cars already using fuel
cells to power them. It is likely that this means of energy production will
become more prominent, as fossil fuels are phased out and technology continues to
develop, allowing for cheaper, more sustainable and renewable ways to generate the
reactants used in fuel cells. In this chapter, you will discover how fuel cells operate and
explore many of the key design features that allow for efficient and safe storage, as well
as how they are a key component in helping to meet the future energy needs of society.

Fuel cell electric vehicles
Electric cars are becoming more and more common, such as those made by Tesla. Tesla
make battery-powered vehicles, in which the battery stores up energy (via charging) that
is then used to power the electric motor. Another type of electric car is also available: the
fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). In FCEVs, such as the Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo,
hydrogen and oxygen combine in the fuel cell to generate electricity. Compared
to batteries, which take considerable time to charge, FCEVs can be refuelled in less than
four minutes. They can also travel further on average than battery-powered vehicles,
which is often one of the main reasons people are reluctant to switch to electric cars.
So why are FCEVs so much less popular? One of the biggest problems is that of
infrastructure. While hydrogen fuel cells have had plenty of success in powering non-
consumer engines, such as those of space shuttles and aircraft, their use in daily life is
limited by the need for vehicle refuelling stations to be common and easily accessible.
Currently, it is simply too costly and difficult to implement such infrastructure
compared to battery-charging stations. If hydrogen could be more readily available, and
sourced renewably, FCEVs could become much more common.

HOW DO FUEL
CELLS WORK?
EXPLAIN
Fuel cells
Fuel cells work in a similar way to other types of galvanic cells (which were discussed in
Section 3C), using spontaneous reactions to convert chemical energy into electrical energy.
Unlike primary galvanic cells, which eventually reach a state of equilibrium and no longer
produce electrical energy, fuel cells are a type of galvanic cell that do not store the reactants
in the cell. Instead, the reactants must be supplied from an external source. The huge
advantage of this is that the fuel cells are able to produce a continuous supply of electricity,
provided the supply of reactants into the cell is maintained. As well as this, they do not
require recharging like secondary cells do.
There are many different types of fuel cell, including the hydrogen-fuelled polymer
electrolyte membrane (also known as a proton exchange membrane or PEM) fuel cell,
methanol fuel cells, alkaline fuel cells (such as potassium hydroxide cells), phosphoric
acid fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells. Regardless of the type of fuel cell, they share many
advantages, such as:
• They have higher efficiency than coal-fired power stations or combustion car engines.
This is because they directly convert chemical energy into electrical energy, rather
than relying on a number of energy transformation steps, which ultimately result in a
decrease in efficiency.
• They are relatively quiet when operating and the products of the reactions are generally
more environmentally friendly.
• Unlike other galvanic cells, the fuels used are not stored in the cell itself and so must
be generated and supplied from an external source. However, provided that there is a
constant supply of reactants, fuel cells are able to sustain long-term continuous energy
production (without needing to be recharged or replaced regularly).
• Catalysts and modifications to electrode design can be used to increase the rate
of reaction.
• Fuel cells are portable. Although they can’t necessarily be packaged into small battery-
sized compartments, their ability to produce electricity directly where it is needed makes
them suitable for use in vehicles, including space shuttles.
• There are a range of reactants that are suitable for use in fuel cells.
• They also generate heat, which can be used to minimise energy needs to fulfill heating
requirements.
Design features of fuel cells
Each fuel cell has similar design features, including:
• an anode and cathode, separated by an electrolyte
• inlets that allow for the continuous supply of fuel
• inlets that supply the other reactants for the reactions
• outlets for the products to leave the cell
• an external circuit where electrons flow as electrical energy is produced.
These features can be seen in Figure 4A–2 on the following page.

FEATURES OF
FUEL CELLS
Fuel cells often have design features that enhance the efficiency of the cells. Some of these
include:
• the use of catalytic electrodes to speed up the reactions taking place. One such example is
the use of powdered platinum anodes that help break fuel molecules into electrons and
ions. Another example is the use of a nickel cathode, which catalyses the conversion of
excess ions into water molecules.
• oxidation-resistant gas diffusion layers made from carbon-based materials. These
maintain an optimal flow rate of reactant gases and also ensure minimal water retention
within the cell, which can reduce the power being generated by the cell.
• porous electrodes to increase the effective surface area of the electrode, enhancing the
ability for gaseous reactants to diffuse through them easily and react with the ions
present in the electrolyte solution of the cell. This also distributes the current more
evenly within the electrode, improving the efficiency of the cell.
Sustainability and environmental considerations
With the current challenges of meeting society’s energy needs, there is more emphasis
than ever on researching and exploring innovative ways to design fuel cells in a way that
increases energy efficiency and minimises fuel consumption. Currently, fuel cells are used
mainly for space exploration, vehicle transportation and stationary power generation, the
latter of which can be configured to provide both heat and power. Using fuel cells in this
way improves energy efficiency as, in addition to the electrical energy that the cells produce,
the heat from the fuel cells can be used to generate hot water and low-pressure steam.
An absorption chiller can also be employed to use otherwise wasted energy to produce
chilled water.

134 CHAPTER 4 FUEL CELLS
One of the most discussed fuel cells to improve the environmental impact of energy
production is the hydrogen fuel cell. While there are many potential applications where
hydrogen fuel cells may prove to be useful, there is particular interest in how they could be
implemented in cars.
Figure 4A–3 Cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells may produce less than 50% of
the greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles currently running on petrol.
Hydrogen fuel cells have the same basic structure as other fuel cells but specifically have
hydrogen as the input. Importantly, the ‘waste’ products that are generated from these
fuel cells are heat and water (Figure 4A–4). As mentioned earlier, not only are these more
environmentally friendly than the outputs of traditional engines, but they can be useful to
help drive other processes.

According to a report by the United States Government Department of Energy, these fuel
cell-powered vehicles have the following benefits:
• They can generate energy with an efficiency of around 60%, whereas conventional petrol
engines are less than 20% efficient.
• Using natural gas as a source of hydrogen, these vehicles would have total greenhouse
gas emissions that are less than 50% of those produced by current vehicles.

As mentioned, as well as the improved efficiency, fuel cells use natural gas, or better still,
biogas or biomass, which can be re-formed into hydrogen. It is the hydrogen that then reacts
in the fuel cell to provide the electrical energy. Biogas can be generated from renewable
feedstocks, such as corn starch, switchgrass and soybean oil, as well as food scraps and
animal waste. However, classification of what is considered renewable can be debated.
There are huge advantages to the use of this material to produce energy. It is estimated that
every year in the United States alone, there could be up to one trillion kilograms of biomass
available for energy use. Biomass is converted to hydrogen gas, and other products, through
a process known as gasification.

The utilisation of organic and renewable feedstocks is one of the most important and
significant challenges that chemists face in the world today as society moves to eliminate
the use of non-renewable carbon resources such as coal, oil and natural gas. However,
our conceptions of what feedstocks should be considered renewable is still developing. In
December 2022, Australia became the first major economy to exclude native forest biomass
from being considered a renewable energy source. This is different from other regions,
such as the European Union (EU), which significantly relies on ‘woody biomass’ (the term
for trees and woody plants) to meet its renewable energy targets. Only time will tell if this
leads to any further global shift in the understanding of renewability, but regardless, there
will continue to be innovation and developments in the drive to produce fuel cells that are
designed to run more efficiently on affordable, scalable and sustainable fuels that have low
emissions to make them more environmentally friendly.

Using tables for comparison
In Section 1A, the Skills section described important things to remember when writing
answers that require you to perform a comparison. To expand on these comments,
another useful technique when writing answers that involve a comparison is the use of a
table. Using a table is a really helpful method for ensuring that you illustrate your answer
clearly and cover all of the required points.
As an example, based on the material covered in this section, you could reasonably
expect to receive a question that asked the following:
Question: Compare the features and function of primary galvanic cells and fuel cells.
Answer: Instead of answering this as a paragraph of text, you may find it suits you better
to use a table. There are a couple of different ways that you could structure your tables.
Firstly, as shown below, you could have one column for galvanic cells and one column
for fuel cells. Each line in the table could then be used to describe a specific aspect, such
as the overall purpose, which has been filled in already. Any differences between the two
regarding that aspect would be highlighted by the text in each column.
Primary galvanic cells Fuel cells
Convert or make the header row singular
chemical energy into electrical energy
Convert chemical energy into electrical
energy
Secondly, as shown below, you could set up your table in a way that has a column for
similarities and a column for differences. This allows you to specifically highlight the
aspects in common and those that differ, but it doesn’t necessarily align them by an
overall theme.
Similarities Differences
Either method is effective, and it is important to work out what suits you personally. For
revision, you may wish to fill in the tables above with the information you have learned
so far.

1 State two similarities and two differences between primary galvanic cells and fuel cells.
2 State three advantages of using fuel cells.
3 Explain the importance of the following design features used in fuel cells:
a porous electrodes
b catalytic electrodes

Who was Faraday?
Michael Faraday, born in 1791, was a scientist who made incredible discoveries in the
fields of chemistry and physics. He discovered several organic compounds, including
bicarburet of hydrogen (which we now call benzene), and many of his scientific
contributions laid the foundations for electromagnetic field theory. In this section,
we will look at two laws described by Faraday in 1833. These laws directly relate the
amount of reactant or product formed over time in an electrochemical cell with the
electric charge that runs through it. In commercial chemistry, where large amounts of
compounds need to be generated with a level of exactness, being able to apply these
laws is particularly significant. In this section, you will learn how to perform calculations
related to galvanic and fuel cells using Faraday’s laws.

It is important to be able to control or predict the outcomes in electrochemical cells. For
example, how much metal will be deposited at the cathode? How much reactant is needed
to produce a certain amount of electrical energy? How long will the cell operate for?

Faraday’s
constant
the amount of
charge that 1
mole of electrons
carries (F =
96 500 C mol–1)
To help understand how the number of electrons flowing through a circuit can be related
to the mass of the reactants consumed or products formed, we first need to understand
Faraday’s laws which state the following:
1 The mass of a substance (m) produced or consumed at an electrode is directly
proportional (∝) to the electric charge (Q) (m ∝ Q).
2 The amounts, in moles, of different substances produced or consumed at electrodes by
the passage of the same amount of electricity are inversely proportional to the charges
1
on their ions (n ∝
ionic charge).
3 Electric charge is measured in coulombs and is represented by the symbol, Q. The
amount of charge that 1 mole of electrons has is 96 500 coulombs (C). This amount is
known as Faraday’s constant, F, and can be written as:
F = 96 500 C mol–1
This relationship can be expressed through the equation:
Q = n(e–) × F
where:
Q = The electric charge (in coulombs)
n(e–) = The number of moles of electrons
F = Faraday’s constant (96 500 C mol–1)
Current and time
Current (I) is the rate that electric charge flows through a circuit during a certain period
of time and is measured in amperes or amps (A). One ampere is equal to one coulomb of
charge per second:
Current
the rate at which
electrons flow
within a circuit
Ampere
the unit used
for measuring
electric current;
also known
as amp
1 ampere (A) = 1 coulomb (C) per second (s)
1 A = 1 C s–1
The current flowing in an electrochemical cell will be directly proportional to the charge.
Put simply, the higher the current running through the cell, the more electrons passing
through the circuit, and the greater the amount of products formed. For example, if twice
the current is produced over a certain amount of time, then twice as many moles of the
products will be formed. Similarly, twice as much of the reactants will be consumed.
The time, t, for which a cell is operating is measured in seconds and is also directly
proportional to the charge. Put simply, the longer a cell operates, the more electrons pass
through the circuit and the greater the amount of products formed.
These factors are represented by the following relationship:
Q = I t
where:
Q = The electric charge (in coulombs)
I = The current (in amperes)
t = The time (in seconds).
NOTE
There is often a need to convert units from seconds to other units of time, and vice versa.
It is worth spending time familiarising yourself with the conversion steps needed for such
calculations.

4B FARADAY’S LAWS

Calculations using Faraday’s laws and stoichiometry
For a galvanic or fuel cell, the chemical reactions that occur are spontaneous, so that once
the cell is connected electrical current will travel through the external circuit. An ammeter
can be used to measure the current over time and subsequently determine the total charge
that flows through the external circuit. Once this is known, the moles of electrons can
be calculated and using the half equations for the reactions taking place, it is possible to
determine how many moles of reactants have been consumed and/or how many moles of
product are formed.

140 CHAPTER 4 FUEL CELLS
Charge of the ion
Consider a galvanic cell with one half-cell containing Na+ ions that will be reduced at the
cathode to sodium metal, as follows:
Na+(aq) + e–
→ Na(s)
For every 1 mole of electrons flowing though the cell, 1 mole of sodium metal is produced.
However, now consider a different galvanic cell with the half-cell containing Mg2+ ions
reacting at the cathode as follows:
Mg2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Mg(s)
In this reaction, to produce 1 mole of magnesium metal, there are 2 moles of electrons
required, twice as many as were needed for sodium.
Lastly, imagine a galvanic cell with a half-cell containing Al3+ ions reacting at the cathode as
follows:
Al3+(aq) + 3e–
→ Al(s)
In this reaction, to produce 1 mole of aluminium metal, there are 3 moles of electrons
required, three times as many as were needed for sodium.
As mentioned earlier, this relationship can be represented by the following equation:
Q = n(e–) × F
Simply put, the larger the charge on the ion, the smaller the amount of that species will
react or be produced during the reaction.

Units and unit conversion
In this section, you have seen that in calculations you may be dealing with many
different units: coulombs, amperes, grams, seconds, minutes, moles etc. It is important
that you are confident with the unit that is associated with every aspect of your
calculations, as you should make it a habit to include them in all your working-out steps
and, even more importantly, in your final answer. An answer without units provided,
assuming they are required, is meaningless and may not receive any marks.
In a similar fashion, it is also important to pay close attention to the units that are
required for the answer. A common example of this is found when using the Q = I t
equation, where the question may require you to provide an answer for the time in
minutes. As you may remember, the expression involves time in seconds. Therefore, in
questions such as this, you will need to divide the answer that you get by 60 to end up
with an answer in the appropriate units.

lifetime. Assume the current remains constant.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

FUEL CELLS
Introduction
Fuel cells are already used to provide clean, quiet and efficient energy and are
likely to continue to be developed further as a means of meeting our future
energy needs. Globally, there are rockets, buses and cars already using fuel
cells to power them. It is likely that this means of energy production will
become more prominent, as fossil fuels are phased out and technology continues to
develop, allowing for cheaper, more sustainable and renewable ways to generate the
reactants used in fuel cells. In this chapter, you will discover how fuel cells operate and
explore many of the key design features that allow for efficient and safe storage, as well
as how they are a key component in helping to meet the future energy needs of society.

Fuel cell electric vehicles
Electric cars are becoming more and more common, such as those made by Tesla. Tesla
make battery-powered vehicles, in which the battery stores up energy (via charging) that
is then used to power the electric motor. Another type of electric car is also available: the
fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). In FCEVs, such as the Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo,
hydrogen and oxygen combine in the fuel cell to generate electricity. Compared
to batteries, which take considerable time to charge, FCEVs can be refuelled in less than
four minutes. They can also travel further on average than battery-powered vehicles,
which is often one of the main reasons people are reluctant to switch to electric cars.
So why are FCEVs so much less popular? One of the biggest problems is that of
infrastructure. While hydrogen fuel cells have had plenty of success in powering non-
consumer engines, such as those of space shuttles and aircraft, their use in daily life is
limited by the need for vehicle refuelling stations to be common and easily accessible.
Currently, it is simply too costly and difficult to implement such infrastructure
compared to battery-charging stations. If hydrogen could be more readily available, and
sourced renewably, FCEVs could become much more common.

HOW DO FUEL
CELLS WORK?
EXPLAIN
Fuel cells
Fuel cells work in a similar way to other types of galvanic cells (which were discussed in
Section 3C), using spontaneous reactions to convert chemical energy into electrical energy.
Unlike primary galvanic cells, which eventually reach a state of equilibrium and no longer
produce electrical energy, fuel cells are a type of galvanic cell that do not store the reactants
in the cell. Instead, the reactants must be supplied from an external source. The huge
advantage of this is that the fuel cells are able to produce a continuous supply of electricity,
provided the supply of reactants into the cell is maintained. As well as this, they do not
require recharging like secondary cells do.
There are many different types of fuel cell, including the hydrogen-fuelled polymer
electrolyte membrane (also known as a proton exchange membrane or PEM) fuel cell,
methanol fuel cells, alkaline fuel cells (such as potassium hydroxide cells), phosphoric
acid fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells. Regardless of the type of fuel cell, they share many
advantages, such as:
• They have higher efficiency than coal-fired power stations or combustion car engines.
This is because they directly convert chemical energy into electrical energy, rather
than relying on a number of energy transformation steps, which ultimately result in a
decrease in efficiency.
• They are relatively quiet when operating and the products of the reactions are generally
more environmentally friendly.
• Unlike other galvanic cells, the fuels used are not stored in the cell itself and so must
be generated and supplied from an external source. However, provided that there is a
constant supply of reactants, fuel cells are able to sustain long-term continuous energy
production (without needing to be recharged or replaced regularly).
• Catalysts and modifications to electrode design can be used to increase the rate
of reaction.
• Fuel cells are portable. Although they can’t necessarily be packaged into small battery-
sized compartments, their ability to produce electricity directly where it is needed makes
them suitable for use in vehicles, including space shuttles.
• There are a range of reactants that are suitable for use in fuel cells.
• They also generate heat, which can be used to minimise energy needs to fulfill heating
requirements.
Design features of fuel cells
Each fuel cell has similar design features, including:
• an anode and cathode, separated by an electrolyte
• inlets that allow for the continuous supply of fuel
• inlets that supply the other reactants for the reactions
• outlets for the products to leave the cell
• an external circuit where electrons flow as electrical energy is produced.
These features can be seen in Figure 4A–2 on the following page.

FEATURES OF
FUEL CELLS
Fuel cells often have design features that enhance the efficiency of the cells. Some of these
include:
• the use of catalytic electrodes to speed up the reactions taking place. One such example is
the use of powdered platinum anodes that help break fuel molecules into electrons and
ions. Another example is the use of a nickel cathode, which catalyses the conversion of
excess ions into water molecules.
• oxidation-resistant gas diffusion layers made from carbon-based materials. These
maintain an optimal flow rate of reactant gases and also ensure minimal water retention
within the cell, which can reduce the power being generated by the cell.
• porous electrodes to increase the effective surface area of the electrode, enhancing the
ability for gaseous reactants to diffuse through them easily and react with the ions
present in the electrolyte solution of the cell. This also distributes the current more
evenly within the electrode, improving the efficiency of the cell.
Sustainability and environmental considerations
With the current challenges of meeting society’s energy needs, there is more emphasis
than ever on researching and exploring innovative ways to design fuel cells in a way that
increases energy efficiency and minimises fuel consumption. Currently, fuel cells are used
mainly for space exploration, vehicle transportation and stationary power generation, the
latter of which can be configured to provide both heat and power. Using fuel cells in this
way improves energy efficiency as, in addition to the electrical energy that the cells produce,
the heat from the fuel cells can be used to generate hot water and low-pressure steam.
An absorption chiller can also be employed to use otherwise wasted energy to produce
chilled water.

134 CHAPTER 4 FUEL CELLS
One of the most discussed fuel cells to improve the environmental impact of energy
production is the hydrogen fuel cell. While there are many potential applications where
hydrogen fuel cells may prove to be useful, there is particular interest in how they could be
implemented in cars.
Figure 4A–3 Cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells may produce less than 50% of
the greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles currently running on petrol.
Hydrogen fuel cells have the same basic structure as other fuel cells but specifically have
hydrogen as the input. Importantly, the ‘waste’ products that are generated from these
fuel cells are heat and water (Figure 4A–4). As mentioned earlier, not only are these more
environmentally friendly than the outputs of traditional engines, but they can be useful to
help drive other processes.

According to a report by the United States Government Department of Energy, these fuel
cell-powered vehicles have the following benefits:
• They can generate energy with an efficiency of around 60%, whereas conventional petrol
engines are less than 20% efficient.
• Using natural gas as a source of hydrogen, these vehicles would have total greenhouse
gas emissions that are less than 50% of those produced by current vehicles.

135
As mentioned, as well as the improved efficiency, fuel cells use natural gas, or better still,
biogas or biomass, which can be re-formed into hydrogen. It is the hydrogen that then reacts
in the fuel cell to provide the electrical energy. Biogas can be generated from renewable
feedstocks, such as corn starch, switchgrass and soybean oil, as well as food scraps and
animal waste. However, classification of what is considered renewable can be debated.
There are huge advantages to the use of this material to produce energy. It is estimated that
every year in the United States alone, there could be up to one trillion kilograms of biomass
available for energy use. Biomass is converted to hydrogen gas, and other products, through
a process known as gasification.

The utilisation of organic and renewable feedstocks is one of the most important and
significant challenges that chemists face in the world today as society moves to eliminate
the use of non-renewable carbon resources such as coal, oil and natural gas. However,
our conceptions of what feedstocks should be considered renewable is still developing. In
December 2022, Australia became the first major economy to exclude native forest biomass
from being considered a renewable energy source. This is different from other regions,
such as the European Union (EU), which significantly relies on ‘woody biomass’ (the term
for trees and woody plants) to meet its renewable energy targets. Only time will tell if this
leads to any further global shift in the understanding of renewability, but regardless, there
will continue to be innovation and developments in the drive to produce fuel cells that are
designed to run more efficiently on affordable, scalable and sustainable fuels that have low
emissions to make them more environmentally friendly.

Using tables for comparison
In Section 1A, the Skills section described important things to remember when writing
answers that require you to perform a comparison. To expand on these comments,
another useful technique when writing answers that involve a comparison is the use of a
table. Using a table is a really helpful method for ensuring that you illustrate your answer
clearly and cover all of the required points.
As an example, based on the material covered in this section, you could reasonably
expect to receive a question that asked the following:
Question: Compare the features and function of primary galvanic cells and fuel cells.
Answer: Instead of answering this as a paragraph of text, you may find it suits you better
to use a table. There are a couple of different ways that you could structure your tables.
Firstly, as shown below, you could have one column for galvanic cells and one column
for fuel cells. Each line in the table could then be used to describe a specific aspect, such
as the overall purpose, which has been filled in already. Any differences between the two
regarding that aspect would be highlighted by the text in each column.
Primary galvanic cells Fuel cells
Convert or make the header row singular
chemical energy into electrical energy
Convert chemical energy into electrical
energy
Secondly, as shown below, you could set up your table in a way that has a column for
similarities and a column for differences. This allows you to specifically highlight the
aspects in common and those that differ, but it doesn’t necessarily align them by an
overall theme.
Similarities Differences
Either method is effective, and it is important to work out what suits you personally. For
revision, you may wish to fill in the tables above with the information you have learned
so far.

2 State three advantages of using fuel cells.

Who was Faraday?
Michael Faraday, born in 1791, was a scientist who made incredible discoveries in the
fields of chemistry and physics. He discovered several organic compounds, including
bicarburet of hydrogen (which we now call benzene), and many of his scientific
contributions laid the foundations for electromagnetic field theory. In this section,
we will look at two laws described by Faraday in 1833. These laws directly relate the
amount of reactant or product formed over time in an electrochemical cell with the
electric charge that runs through it. In commercial chemistry, where large amounts of
compounds need to be generated with a level of exactness, being able to apply these
laws is particularly significant. In this section, you will learn how to perform calculations
related to galvanic and fuel cells using Faraday’s laws.

Faraday’s laws
It is important to be able to control or predict the outcomes in electrochemical cells. For
example, how much metal will be deposited at the cathode? How much reactant is needed
to produce a certain amount of electrical energy? How long will the cell operate for?

To help understand how the number of electrons flowing through a circuit can be related
to the mass of the reactants consumed or products formed, we first need to understand
Faraday’s laws which state the following:
1 The mass of a substance (m) produced or consumed at an electrode is directly
proportional (∝) to the electric charge (Q) (m ∝ Q).
2 The amounts, in moles, of different substances produced or consumed at electrodes by
the passage of the same amount of electricity are inversely proportional to the charges
1
on their ions (n ∝
ionic charge).
3 Electric charge is measured in coulombs and is represented by the symbol, Q. The
amount of charge that 1 mole of electrons has is 96 500 coulombs (C). This amount is
known as Faraday’s constant, F, and can be written as:
F = 96 500 C mol–1
This relationship can be expressed through the equation:
Q = n(e–) × F
where:
Q = The electric charge (in coulombs)
n(e–) = The number of moles of electrons
F = Faraday’s constant (96 500 C mol–1)
Current and time
Current (I) is the rate that electric charge flows through a circuit during a certain period
of time and is measured in amperes or amps (A). One ampere is equal to one coulomb of
charge per second:

the rate at which
electrons flow
within a circuit
Ampere
the unit used
for measuring
electric current;
also known
as amp
1 ampere (A) = 1 coulomb (C) per second (s)
1 A = 1 C s–1
The current flowing in an electrochemical cell will be directly proportional to the charge.
Put simply, the higher the current running through the cell, the more electrons passing
through the circuit, and the greater the amount of products formed. For example, if twice
the current is produced over a certain amount of time, then twice as many moles of the
products will be formed. Similarly, twice as much of the reactants will be consumed.
The time, t, for which a cell is operating is measured in seconds and is also directly
proportional to the charge. Put simply, the longer a cell operates, the more electrons pass
through the circuit and the greater the amount of products formed.
These factors are represented by the following relationship:
Q = I t
where:
Q = The electric charge (in coulombs)
I = The current (in amperes)
t = The time (in seconds).
NOTE
There is often a need to convert units from seconds to other units of time, and vice versa.
It is worth spending time familiarising yourself with the conversion steps needed for such
calculations.

4B FARADAY’S LAWS
139
Calculations using Faraday’s laws and stoichiometry
For a galvanic or fuel cell, the chemical reactions that occur are spontaneous, so that once
the cell is connected electrical current will travel through the external circuit. An ammeter
can be used to measure the current over time and subsequently determine the total charge
that flows through the external circuit. Once this is known, the moles of electrons can
be calculated and using the half equations for the reactions taking place, it is possible to
determine how many moles of reactants have been consumed and/or how many moles of
product are formed.

EXAMPLE 4B–1
A galvanic cell consists of two half-cells, one containing a nickel electrode and nickel
ions, Ni2+, the other with a silver electrode and silver ions, Ag+
.
a How much charge will flow through the cell if 3.50 g of nickel reacts?
Solution
Step 1 Logic Identify the two half-equations occurring
in the cell using the electrochemical
series.
Process
Reduction: Ag+(aq) + e–
→ Ag(s)
Oxidation: Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 2 Calculate the number of moles of nickel
using n =
m
M.
n(Ni) = m
M
n(Ni) = 3.5 g
58.7 g mol–1
n(Ni) = 0.0596 mol
Step 3 Determine the mole ratio of electrons to
solid nickel.
n(e–) : n(Ni) = 2 : 1
Step 4 Calculate the number of moles of
electrons using the mole ratio.
n(e–) = n(Ni) × 2
n(e–) = 0.0596 × 2
n(e–) = 0.119 mol
Step 5 Calculate the amount of charge using
Faraday’s constant.
Q = n(e–) × F
Q = 0.119 mol × 96 500
Q = 11 500 C
b If a constant current of 4.2 amps is applied, how long would it take for 3.5 g of nickel
to react (to the nearest minute)?
Solution
Step 1 Logic Identify the key pieces of information in
the question.
Process
I = 4.2 amps
Q = 11 500 C (from part a)
Step 2 Rearrange Q = It to solve for t. Q = It

t =

140 CHAPTER 4 FUEL CELLS
Charge of the ion
Consider a galvanic cell with one half-cell containing Na+ ions that will be reduced at the
cathode to sodium metal, as follows:
Na+(aq) + e–
→ Na(s)
For every 1 mole of electrons flowing though the cell, 1 mole of sodium metal is produced.
However, now consider a different galvanic cell with the half-cell containing Mg2+ ions
reacting at the cathode as follows:
Mg2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Mg(s)
In this reaction, to produce 1 mole of magnesium metal, there are 2 moles of electrons
required, twice as many as were needed for sodium.
Lastly, imagine a galvanic cell with a half-cell containing Al3+ ions reacting at the cathode as
follows:
Al3+(aq) + 3e–
→ Al(s)
In this reaction, to produce 1 mole of aluminium metal, there are 3 moles of electrons
required, three times as many as were needed for sodium.
As mentioned earlier, this relationship can be represented by the following equation:
Q = n(e–) × F
Simply put, the larger the charge on the ion, the smaller the amount of that species will
react or be produced during the reaction.

4B SKILLS
Units and unit conversion
In this section, you have seen that in calculations you may be dealing with many
different units: coulombs, amperes, grams, seconds, minutes, moles etc. It is important
that you are confident with the unit that is associated with every aspect of your
calculations, as you should make it a habit to include them in all your working-out steps
and, even more importantly, in your final answer. An answer without units provided,
assuming they are required, is meaningless and may not receive any marks.
In a similar fashion, it is also important to pay close attention to the units that are
required for the answer. A common example of this is found when using the Q = I t
equation, where the question may require you to provide an answer for the time in
minutes. As you may remember, the expression involves time in seconds. Therefore, in
questions such as this, you will need to divide the answer that you get by 60 to end up
with an answer in the appropriate units.
Section 4B questions
1 Nickel ions undergo reduction to solid nickel at the cathode of a particular galvanic cell.
Determine how long it will take to deposit 2.00 grams of nickel in a galvanic cell if a
current of 1.85 amps is applied to the cell, to the nearest minute.
2 Solid copper undergoes oxidation to copper(II) ions at the anode in a galvanic cell.
Determine the mass of copper lost if 1.2 amps of current is running through the cell for
12.0 minutes.
3 Determine the amount of current running through a fuel cell if 11.65 grams of silver at
the cathode are deposited after 2.50 hours. The reaction occurring at the cathode is:
Ag+(aq) + e–
→ Ag(s)
4 Hearing aids are often powered by alkaline batteries that last for 1200 hours. The half-
reactions occurring in an alkaline battery are:
Zn(s) + 2OH−(aq) → ZnO(s) + H2O(l) + 2e−
2MnO2(s) + H2O(l) + 2e−
→ Mn2O3(s) + 2OH−(aq)
If a hearing aid uses 1 mA of current, calculate the mass of zinc reacting during its
lifetime. Assume the current remains constant.

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

FUEL CELLS
Introduction
Fuel cells are already used to provide clean, quiet and efficient energy and are
likely to continue to be developed further as a means of meeting our future
energy needs. Globally, there are rockets, buses and cars already using fuel
cells to power them. It is likely that this means of energy production will
become more prominent, as fossil fuels are phased out and technology continues to
develop, allowing for cheaper, more sustainable and renewable ways to generate the
reactants used in fuel cells. In this chapter, you will discover how fuel cells operate and
explore many of the key design features that allow for efficient and safe storage, as well
as how they are a key component in helping to meet the future energy needs of society.

Fuel cell electric vehicles
Electric cars are becoming more and more common, such as those made by Tesla. Tesla
make battery-powered vehicles, in which the battery stores up energy (via charging) that
is then used to power the electric motor. Another type of electric car is also available: the
fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). In FCEVs, such as the Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo,
hydrogen and oxygen combine in the fuel cell to generate electricity. Compared
to batteries, which take considerable time to charge, FCEVs can be refuelled in less than
four minutes. They can also travel further on average than battery-powered vehicles,
which is often one of the main reasons people are reluctant to switch to electric cars.
So why are FCEVs so much less popular? One of the biggest problems is that of
infrastructure. While hydrogen fuel cells have had plenty of success in powering non-
consumer engines, such as those of space shuttles and aircraft, their use in daily life is
limited by the need for vehicle refuelling stations to be common and easily accessible.
Currently, it is simply too costly and difficult to implement such infrastructure
compared to battery-charging stations. If hydrogen could be more readily available, and
sourced renewably, FCEVs could become much more common.

HOW DO FUEL
CELLS WORK?
EXPLAIN
Fuel cells
Fuel cells work in a similar way to other types of galvanic cells (which were discussed in
Section 3C), using spontaneous reactions to convert chemical energy into electrical energy.
Unlike primary galvanic cells, which eventually reach a state of equilibrium and no longer
produce electrical energy, fuel cells are a type of galvanic cell that do not store the reactants
in the cell. Instead, the reactants must be supplied from an external source. The huge
advantage of this is that the fuel cells are able to produce a continuous supply of electricity,
provided the supply of reactants into the cell is maintained. As well as this, they do not
require recharging like secondary cells do.
There are many different types of fuel cell, including the hydrogen-fuelled polymer
electrolyte membrane (also known as a proton exchange membrane or PEM) fuel cell,
methanol fuel cells, alkaline fuel cells (such as potassium hydroxide cells), phosphoric
acid fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells. Regardless of the type of fuel cell, they share many
advantages, such as:
• They have higher efficiency than coal-fired power stations or combustion car engines.
This is because they directly convert chemical energy into electrical energy, rather
than relying on a number of energy transformation steps, which ultimately result in a
decrease in efficiency.
• They are relatively quiet when operating and the products of the reactions are generally
more environmentally friendly.
• Unlike other galvanic cells, the fuels used are not stored in the cell itself and so must
be generated and supplied from an external source. However, provided that there is a
constant supply of reactants, fuel cells are able to sustain long-term continuous energy
production (without needing to be recharged or replaced regularly).
• Catalysts and modifications to electrode design can be used to increase the rate
of reaction.
• Fuel cells are portable. Although they can’t necessarily be packaged into small battery-
sized compartments, their ability to produce electricity directly where it is needed makes
them suitable for use in vehicles, including space shuttles.
• There are a range of reactants that are suitable for use in fuel cells.
• They also generate heat, which can be used to minimise energy needs to fulfill heating
requirements.
Design features of fuel cells
Each fuel cell has similar design features, including:
• an anode and cathode, separated by an electrolyte
• inlets that allow for the continuous supply of fuel
• inlets that supply the other reactants for the reactions
• outlets for the products to leave the cell
• an external circuit where electrons flow as electrical energy is produced.
These features can be seen in Figure 4A–2 on the following page.

FEATURES OF
FUEL CELLS
Fuel cells often have design features that enhance the efficiency of the cells. Some of these
include:
• the use of catalytic electrodes to speed up the reactions taking place. One such example is
the use of powdered platinum anodes that help break fuel molecules into electrons and
ions. Another example is the use of a nickel cathode, which catalyses the conversion of
excess ions into water molecules.
• oxidation-resistant gas diffusion layers made from carbon-based materials. These
maintain an optimal flow rate of reactant gases and also ensure minimal water retention
within the cell, which can reduce the power being generated by the cell.
• porous electrodes to increase the effective surface area of the electrode, enhancing the
ability for gaseous reactants to diffuse through them easily and react with the ions
present in the electrolyte solution of the cell. This also distributes the current more
evenly within the electrode, improving the efficiency of the cell.
Sustainability and environmental considerations
With the current challenges of meeting society’s energy needs, there is more emphasis
than ever on researching and exploring innovative ways to design fuel cells in a way that
increases energy efficiency and minimises fuel consumption. Currently, fuel cells are used
mainly for space exploration, vehicle transportation and stationary power generation, the
latter of which can be configured to provide both heat and power. Using fuel cells in this
way improves energy efficiency as, in addition to the electrical energy that the cells produce,
the heat from the fuel cells can be used to generate hot water and low-pressure steam.
An absorption chiller can also be employed to use otherwise wasted energy to produce
chilled water.

134 CHAPTER 4 FUEL CELLS
One of the most discussed fuel cells to improve the environmental impact of energy
production is the hydrogen fuel cell. While there are many potential applications where
hydrogen fuel cells may prove to be useful, there is particular interest in how they could be
implemented in cars.
Figure 4A–3 Cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells may produce less than 50% of
the greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles currently running on petrol.
Hydrogen fuel cells have the same basic structure as other fuel cells but specifically have
hydrogen as the input. Importantly, the ‘waste’ products that are generated from these
fuel cells are heat and water (Figure 4A–4). As mentioned earlier, not only are these more
environmentally friendly than the outputs of traditional engines, but they can be useful to
help drive other processes.

cell-powered vehicles have the following benefits:
• They can generate energy with an efficiency of around 60%, whereas conventional petrol
engines are less than 20% efficient.
• Using natural gas as a source of hydrogen, these vehicles would have total greenhouse
gas emissions that are less than 50% of those produced by current vehicles.

135
As mentioned, as well as the improved efficiency, fuel cells use natural gas, or better still,
biogas or biomass, which can be re-formed into hydrogen. It is the hydrogen that then reacts
in the fuel cell to provide the electrical energy. Biogas can be generated from renewable
feedstocks, such as corn starch, switchgrass and soybean oil, as well as food scraps and
animal waste. However, classification of what is considered renewable can be debated.
There are huge advantages to the use of this material to produce energy. It is estimated that
every year in the United States alone, there could be up to one trillion kilograms of biomass
available for energy use. Biomass is converted to hydrogen gas, and other products, through
a process known as gasification.

The utilisation of organic and renewable feedstocks is one of the most important and
significant challenges that chemists face in the world today as society moves to eliminate
the use of non-renewable carbon resources such as coal, oil and natural gas. However,
our conceptions of what feedstocks should be considered renewable is still developing. In
December 2022, Australia became the first major economy to exclude native forest biomass
from being considered a renewable energy source. This is different from other regions,
such as the European Union (EU), which significantly relies on ‘woody biomass’ (the term
for trees and woody plants) to meet its renewable energy targets. Only time will tell if this
leads to any further global shift in the understanding of renewability, but regardless, there
will continue to be innovation and developments in the drive to produce fuel cells that are
designed to run more efficiently on affordable, scalable and sustainable fuels that have low
emissions to make them more environmentally friendly.

Using tables for comparison
In Section 1A, the Skills section described important things to remember when writing
answers that require you to perform a comparison. To expand on these comments,
another useful technique when writing answers that involve a comparison is the use of a
table. Using a table is a really helpful method for ensuring that you illustrate your answer
clearly and cover all of the required points.
As an example, based on the material covered in this section, you could reasonably
expect to receive a question that asked the following:
Question: Compare the features and function of primary galvanic cells and fuel cells.
Answer: Instead of answering this as a paragraph of text, you may find it suits you better
to use a table. There are a couple of different ways that you could structure your tables.
Firstly, as shown below, you could have one column for galvanic cells and one column
for fuel cells. Each line in the table could then be used to describe a specific aspect, such
as the overall purpose, which has been filled in already. Any differences between the two
regarding that aspect would be highlighted by the text in each column.
Primary galvanic cells Fuel cells
Convert or make the header row singular
chemical energy into electrical energy
Convert chemical energy into electrical

Secondly, as shown below, you could set up your table in a way that has a column for
similarities and a column for differences. This allows you to specifically highlight the
aspects in common and those that differ, but it doesn’t necessarily align them by an
overall theme.
Similarities Differences
Either method is effective, and it is important to work out what suits you personally. For
revision, you may wish to fill in the tables above with the information you have learned
so far.

Who was Faraday?
Michael Faraday, born in 1791, was a scientist who made incredible discoveries in the
fields of chemistry and physics. He discovered several organic compounds, including
bicarburet of hydrogen (which we now call benzene), and many of his scientific
contributions laid the foundations for electromagnetic field theory. In this section,
we will look at two laws described by Faraday in 1833. These laws directly relate the
amount of reactant or product formed over time in an electrochemical cell with the
electric charge that runs through it. In commercial chemistry, where large amounts of
compounds need to be generated with a level of exactness, being able to apply these
laws is particularly significant. In this section, you will learn how to perform calculations
related to galvanic and fuel cells using Faraday’s laws.

It is important to be able to control or predict the outcomes in electrochemical cells. For
example, how much metal will be deposited at the cathode? How much reactant is needed
to produce a certain amount of electrical energy? How long will the cell operate for?

Faraday’s
constant

charge that 1

carries (F =

To help understand how the number of electrons flowing through a circuit can be related
to the mass of the reactants consumed or products formed, we first need to understand
Faraday’s laws which state the following:
1 The mass of a substance (m) produced or consumed at an electrode is directly
proportional (∝) to the electric charge (Q) (m ∝ Q).
2 The amounts, in moles, of different substances produced or consumed at electrodes by
the passage of the same amount of electricity are inversely proportional to the charges
1
on their ions (n ∝
ionic charge).
3 Electric charge is measured in coulombs and is represented by the symbol, Q. The
amount of charge that 1 mole of electrons has is 96 500 coulombs (C). This amount is
known as Faraday’s constant, F, and can be written as:
F = 96 500 C mol–1
This relationship can be expressed through the equation:
Q = n(e–) × F
where:
Q = The electric charge (in coulombs)
n(e–) = The number of moles of electrons
F = Faraday’s constant (96 500 C mol–1)
Current and time
Current (I) is the rate that electric charge flows through a circuit during a certain period
of time and is measured in amperes or amps (A). One ampere is equal to one coulomb of
charge per second:
Current
the rate at which
electrons flow
within a circuit
Ampere
the unit used
for measuring
electric current;
also known
as amp
1 ampere (A) = 1 coulomb (C) per second (s)
1 A = 1 C s–1
The current flowing in an electrochemical cell will be directly proportional to the charge.
Put simply, the higher the current running through the cell, the more electrons passing
through the circuit, and the greater the amount of products formed. For example, if twice
the current is produced over a certain amount of time, then twice as many moles of the
products will be formed. Similarly, twice as much of the reactants will be consumed.
The time, t, for which a cell is operating is measured in seconds and is also directly
proportional to the charge. Put simply, the longer a cell operates, the more electrons pass
through the circuit and the greater the amount of products formed.
These factors are represented by the following relationship:
Q = I t
where:
Q = The electric charge (in coulombs)
I = The current (in amperes)
t = The time (in seconds).
NOTE
There is often a need to convert units from seconds to other units of time, and vice versa.
It is worth spending time familiarising yourself with the conversion steps needed for such
calculations.

4B FARADAY’S LAWS

Calculations using Faraday’s laws and stoichiometry
For a galvanic or fuel cell, the chemical reactions that occur are spontaneous, so that once
the cell is connected electrical current will travel through the external circuit. An ammeter
can be used to measure the current over time and subsequently determine the total charge
that flows through the external circuit. Once this is known, the moles of electrons can
be calculated and using the half equations for the reactions taking place, it is possible to
determine how many moles of reactants have been consumed and/or how many moles of
product are formed.

Charge of the ion
Consider a galvanic cell with one half-cell containing Na+ ions that will be reduced at the
cathode to sodium metal, as follows:
Na+(aq) + e–
→ Na(s)
For every 1 mole of electrons flowing though the cell, 1 mole of sodium metal is produced.
However, now consider a different galvanic cell with the half-cell containing Mg2+ ions
reacting at the cathode as follows:
Mg2+(aq) + 2e–

In this reaction, to produce 1 mole of magnesium metal, there are 2 moles of electrons
required, twice as many as were needed for sodium.
Lastly, imagine a galvanic cell with a half-cell containing Al3+ ions reacting at the cathode as
follows:
Al3+(aq) + 3e–

In this reaction, to produce 1 mole of aluminium metal, there are 3 moles of electrons
required, three times as many as were needed for sodium.
As mentioned earlier, this relationship can be represented by the following equation:
Q = n(e–) × F

react or be produced during the reaction.

Units and unit conversion
In this section, you have seen that in calculations you may be dealing with many
different units: coulombs, amperes, grams, seconds, minutes, moles etc. It is important
that you are confident with the unit that is associated with every aspect of your
calculations, as you should make it a habit to include them in all your working-out steps
and, even more importantly, in your final answer. An answer without units provided,
assuming they are required, is meaningless and may not receive any marks.
In a similar fashion, it is also important to pay close attention to the units that are
required for the answer. A common example of this is found when using the Q = I t
equation, where the question may require you to provide an answer for the time in
minutes. As you may remember, the expression involves time in seconds. Therefore, in
questions such as this, you will need to divide the answer that you get by 60 to end up
with an answer in the appropriate units.

COGNITIVE LEVEL: toLevel5 (Analyze & Evaluate)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TARGET: Break down relationships, make judgments, assess validity.
TEST: Can student compare, contrast, infer, critique, or synthesise?
QUESTION TYPES: Compare/contrast, identify relationships, evaluate claims, infer from data, critique reasoning.
STEMS: "Which conclusion is supported by...", "Compare X and Y...", "The evidence suggests...", "Evaluate the claim that..."
REQUIRE: Multi-step reasoning. May include data, scenarios, or competing claims to evaluate.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
