      "correctExplanation": "Both primary galvanic cells and fuel cells convert chemical energy to electrical energy through spontaneous redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions that occur without external energy input.",
      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "An anode, a cathode, and a fuel inlet", "explanation": "Fuel inlets are specific to fuel cells. Primary galvanic cells do not have fuel inlets because their reactants are stored internally." },
        { "answer": "An anode, a turbine, and an electrolyte", "explanation": "Turbines are used in generators and power plants, not in electrochemical cells. Both galvanic cells and fuel cells use an anode, cathode, and electrolyte." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "A fuel cell stores more reactants internally than a primary cell", "explanation": "Fuel cells do not store reactants internally at all. Their key difference is the continuous external supply through inlets." },

      "correctExplanation": "For unattended remote operation, primary lithium cells are self-contained with no moving parts, no fuel tanks, and no water management required. A fuel cell would need hydrogen storage, fuel delivery systems, and water removal, adding complexity.",
