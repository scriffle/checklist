      "code": "4A.4a",
      "what": "Energy efficiency design means maximizing useful energy output relative to energy input. Fuel cells achieve this through direct chemical-to-electrical conversion (60% efficiency), using porous and catalytic electrodes to accelerate reactions, and capturing waste heat for combined heat and power systems.",
      "why": "Higher efficiency reduces fuel consumption, lowers costs, and minimizes environmental impact by requiring less resource extraction and producing fewer emissions per unit of useful energy.",
      "example": "A fuel cell power plant achieves 60% electrical efficiency, and capturing waste heat for building heating increases total efficiency to 85%, compared to 35% for coal power plants.",

      "title": "I can define renewable feedstocks and explain their importance for fuel cells",
      "code": "4A.4b",
      "what": "Renewable feedstocks are raw materials like corn starch, switchgrass, soybean oil, food scraps, and animal waste that can be readily replenished through natural processes. These are converted to hydrogen gas through gasification for use in fuel cells.",
      "why": "Using renewable feedstocks eliminates dependence on finite fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and creates sustainable energy systems aligned with climate goals.",
      "example": "Corn starch (renewable) can be gasified to produce H2 for fuel cells annually, while natural gas (non-renewable) takes millions of years to form and depletes with extraction.",

      "code": "4A.4c",
      "what": "Gasification is the process where carbon-based biomass materials are heated at high temperatures with limited oxygen, breaking them down to produce hydrogen gas, carbon monoxide, and other gas products that can be used as fuel.",
      "why": "Gasification converts abundant, renewable biomass into hydrogen fuel for fuel cells, providing a sustainable alternative to extracting hydrogen from fossil fuels like natural gas.",
      "example": "Food waste and agricultural residues are heated to 800°C with controlled oxygen, producing a mixture containing H2 gas that is purified and supplied to hydrogen fuel cells for electricity generation.",

      "code": "4A.4d",
      "what": "Biogas is formed from anaerobic bacterial breakdown of organic waste. Biomass includes renewable organic matter from plants, animals, and living organisms. In the United States alone, up to one trillion kilograms of biomass are available annually for energy use.",
      "why": "The vast availability of biomass and biogas provides a scalable, sustainable source of hydrogen for fuel cells, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and utilizing waste materials productively.",
      "example": "Switchgrass grown on marginal farmland produces 10 tonnes of biomass per hectare annually, which can be gasified to generate hydrogen for fuel cells without competing with food crops.",

      "why": "Reduced emissions address climate change and air quality concerns. Lifecycle analysis shows fuel cells powered by renewable hydrogen offer substantial environmental improvements over fossil fuel alternatives.",
      "example": "A fuel cell vehicle using hydrogen from biomass gasification emits 90 g CO2-equivalent per km (lifecycle), compared to 180 g CO2 per km for a petrol vehicle, achieving a 50% reduction.",

      "why": "Understanding these challenges explains why fuel cell vehicles remain less common than battery electric vehicles despite technical advantages, and identifies areas requiring innovation and investment.",
      "example": "Building a hydrogen refueling station costs 1-2 million dollars compared to 100,000 dollars for an electric charging station, limiting infrastructure development and fuel cell vehicle adoption.",

      "code": "4A.4g",
      "what": "Different regions classify biomass sources differently for renewability. Australia became the first major economy to exclude native forest biomass from renewable energy in 2022, while the EU relies heavily on woody biomass. Agricultural residues and purpose-grown energy crops are widely accepted as renewable.",
      "why": "Classification affects policy support, funding, and whether fuel cells using certain hydrogen sources qualify as sustainable, influencing development and adoption of fuel cell technology.",
      "example": "Hydrogen from plantation timber gasification qualifies as renewable in the EU but not from native forest logging, while hydrogen from corn starch or food waste is considered renewable globally.",
