        {"answer": "The excess reagent", "explanation": "The excess reagent is not fully consumed, so using its moles would overestimate the product."},

      "correctExplanation": "The CH₄:CO₂ ratio is 1:1. Since CH₄ is limiting with 0.40 mol, 0.40 mol of CO₂ is produced.",
      "distractors": [
        {"answer": "0.80 mol", "explanation": "This doubles the moles using the O₂ coefficient, but the CH₄:CO₂ ratio is 1:1."},

      "correctExplanation": "Once the limiting reagent runs out, no more product forms regardless of how much excess reagent remains.",
      "distractors": [
        {"answer": "Because the excess reagent does not participate in the reaction", "explanation": "The excess reagent does participate; it just has leftover amount after the limiting reagent is consumed."},
