      "correct": "% efficiency = (experimental energy / theoretical energy) × 100%",
      "correctExplanation": "Percentage efficiency compares the experimentally measured energy to the theoretical maximum energy, expressed as a percentage.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "% efficiency = (theoretical energy / experimental energy) × 100%", "explanation": "This inverts the fraction; efficiency divides experimental by theoretical, not the reverse." },
        { "answer": "% efficiency = (experimental energy − theoretical energy) × 100%", "explanation": "Efficiency is a ratio, not a difference; it divides experimental by theoretical." },
        { "answer": "% efficiency = (experimental energy + theoretical energy) / 100%", "explanation": "Efficiency is not the sum of energies divided by 100; it is the ratio multiplied by 100%." }

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Why is the percentage efficiency of a simple calorimetry experiment typically less than 100%?",
      "correct": "Because energy is lost to the surroundings and through incomplete combustion",
      "correctExplanation": "In a simple calorimeter, heat escapes to the surrounding air and container, and incomplete combustion means not all fuel is fully oxidised, so less energy is captured than the theoretical maximum.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because the thermometer absorbs most of the energy from the reaction", "explanation": "The thermometer absorbs only a tiny amount of energy; major losses are to the surroundings and incomplete combustion." },
        { "answer": "Because the theoretical energy values in data books are always inaccurate", "explanation": "Data book values are well-established and accurate; efficiency is less than 100% due to experimental energy losses." },
        { "answer": "Because water cannot absorb all the energy released by a combustion reaction", "explanation": "Water can absorb energy effectively; the issue is that energy escapes the system before reaching the water." }
