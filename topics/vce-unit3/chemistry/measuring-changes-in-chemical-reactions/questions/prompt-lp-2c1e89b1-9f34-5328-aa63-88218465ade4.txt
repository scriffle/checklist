TITLE: I can distinguish between random and systematic errors in calorimetry
CODE: 2B.9

WHAT (concept explanation):
Random errors cause unpredictable variations in measurements (like minor temperature fluctuations), while systematic errors cause consistent deviations in one direction (like heat loss through poor insulation).

WHY (importance):
Understanding error types guides experimental improvement strategies, as random errors are reduced by repeated trials while systematic errors require changes to equipment or procedure.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Consistently low temperature readings indicate systematic error from heat loss, while temperature readings varying randomly around the mean indicate random measurement error.

SUBTOPIC: Calorimetry Principles
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores experimental techniques for measuring heat energy changes in chemical reactions using calorimeters. It covers the specific heat capacity equation, calibration procedures using electrical and chemical methods, and analysis of temperature-time graphs to determine energy transformations.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Calorimetry provides experimental verification of theoretical energy values and allows measurement of heat released from fuels and foods. Understanding calibration and heat loss effects ensures accurate energy measurements, which are essential for fuel efficiency analysis and food energy labeling.

TOPIC: Measuring Changes in Chemical Reactions
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Quantitative analysis of combustion reactions including stoichiometric calculations for greenhouse gas emissions, calorimetry techniques for measuring energy release, and determination of energy content in fuels and foods.

MEASURING CHANGES IN
CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Introduction
Energy is involved in almost every aspect of our lives. The food we eat for
breakfast, lunch and dinner provides our bodies with the energy that they need
to function. The petrol that we use to fill up our cars and motorbikes provides
the energy that they need to run. Electrical energy powers all our equipment
and devices, lights up our homes and helps us communicate all over the world.
In this chapter, we will focus on the energy that is generated from the chemical
reactions involving fuel and food. You will apply stoichiometry to a real-world
problem – the emission of greenhouse gases – and learn how to quantitate the energy
produced from combustion reactions.

ENGAGE
Lowering greenhouse gas emissions for global security
In 2015, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change held a summit in Paris that set down a landmark treaty
on greenhouse gas emissions targets that was supported by 196 member nations. In
November 2016, that treaty was ratified and became legally binding. The goal is to limit
global warming to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels and reach peak greenhouse
gas production as soon as possible.
In 2020, countries submitted their plans to reach their peak targets and the global
warming limit. While COP27, held in Egypt in 2022, revealed the political difficulties in
meeting the 1.5°C target, the 2015 Paris Agreement set the wheels in motion for many
countries to set low-carbon solutions, carbon economies and carbon neutrality targets,
all in the name of reaching this goal. This has led to new jobs, new industries and the
hope that by 2030 zero-carbon solutions could be viable options in sectors that currently
represent 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

EXPLAIN
Greenhouse gases and chemical reactions
Before beginning to explore chemical reactions in more depth, let’s first refresh our
understanding of how greenhouse gases are produced.
Combustion reactions
As you learned in Section 1C, combustion reactions occur when a hydrocarbon is burned
in the presence of oxygen. This results in the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
water vapour (H2O), which are greenhouse gases. Other well-known greenhouse gases
include nitrous oxide (N2O), ozone (O3) and methane (CH4). Methane is emitted during
the extraction and transport of natural gas, as well as from livestock and other agricultural
activities. These gases allow sunlight to pass through Earth’s atmosphere, but they trap the
heat that is reflected from the surface, preventing it from radiating out into space. This
process is known as the greenhouse effect, and it is what makes Earth warm enough to
support life as we know it.

Figure 2A–2 A representation of the natural greenhouse effect
However, an increase of these gases, particularly the ones caused by human activity,
such as CO2 and CH4, causes an enhancement of the greenhouse effect, known as the
enhanced greenhouse effect, which leads to global warming and climate change. Being able
to calculate how much greenhouse gas will be produced from a reaction is therefore critical
in determining the suitability of a reaction or process in line with the societal goals of
decreasing global warming.
When writing combustion reactions, it is also standard practice to state the enthalpy of the
given reaction.

Common combustion reactions
There are several common reactions that produce different greenhouse gases. Carbon
dioxide (CO2) is produced when fossil fuels, such as coal, petrol and natural gas, are burned
for energy. For example, the combustion of octane in a car engine has the equation:
2C8H18(l) + 25O2(g) → 16CO2(g) + 18H2O(l) ΔH = –10 920 kJ mol–1
Not all combustion reactions go to completion. For example, carbon monoxide (CO)
is produced when fuels burn incompletely. For incomplete combustion reactions, the
enthalpy value can vary depending on the conditions. This is because ‘imperfect’ conditions,
such as a lack of oxygen or low temperatures, can lead to incomplete combustion.
Determining heat energy production from the combustion of fuels
Combustion is the chemical process that produces heat energy from the oxidation of fuels.
We can experience the benefits directly around an open fire or indirectly in powering
our homes and vehicles, where the energy from combusted fuels drives other processes.
Combustion reactions are always exothermic – that is, they release heat energy.
To determine the energy released from the combustion of some fuels, we can use the
reference tables found in the VCAA Data book for ‘Molar heat of combustion’, measured in
kJ mol–1, as shown below.

While heat energy transformation into other forms isn’t 100% efficient, a large portion
of this energy produced from combustion reactions can be put to use. Depending on the
amount of fuel available, which is expressed in moles, a certain amount of energy can be
released, as shown in Worked example 2A–1 on the following page.

EXAMPLE 2A–1
Worked example 2A–1: Calculating heat energy produced from burning
a fuel sample
A 100.0 kg quantity of ethanol, C2H5OH, is burned in an industrial stove with an open
air-intake. How much energy, in MJ, will be produced if all the ethanol is burned?
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write down the information that you
have about the known substance.
Process
m(C2H5OH) = 100.0 kg = 100000 g
M(C2H5OH) = 46.0 gmol–1

Step 2 Calculate the amount of substance
being combusted in moles. m(C2H5OH)
n(C2H5OH) =
M(C2H5OH)
= 100000 g
46.0 g mol–1
= 2173.9 mol
Step 3 Determine the energy produced by
multiplying n(C2H5OH) by the molar
heat of combustion of ethanol.
E = 1360 kJmol–1 × 2173.9 mol
= 2956504 kJ

Special conditions of stoichiometry
The amount of energy emitted or required for a reaction can vary considerably, as can
the amount of greenhouse gas produced. It is important to consider two things here:
• The energy value of the enthalpy is in kilojoules.
• The amounts are ‘per mole’ of reference material.
This last point should help us realise how important stoichiometry will be to success in
calculations of greenhouse gas emissions. To do this, we must first be able to successfully
calculations of greenhouse gas emissions. To do this, we must first be able to successfully
balance an equation.

Converting stoichiometrically from different units
In addition to basic calculations, there are times when we don’t need to convert to/from
the amount in moles, n, and we can convert stoichiometrically from different units. This is

Step 4 Use the stoichiometric ratio to
determine the amount of unknown

5 times the amount of CO2 is produced per
amount of pentane
∴ n(CO2) = 5 × n(C5H12) = 5 × 0.5 = 2.5 mol

Mass–mass stoichiometry
For mass–mass stoichiometry, we’re interested in the mass of product produced from a
given mass of reactant or vice versa. To calculate this successfully, we need to determine
the number of moles of the substance we have information for and then follow our ‘down,
across, up’ process, as shown in Figure 2A–3.

using m = n × M.

mass–mass questions. We see this in action in Worked example 2A–4.

Step 4 Determine the stoichiometric

From the equations, the number before
propane is 1 and CO2 is 3.
n(C3H8) : n(CO2) = 1 : 3
Step 5 Use the ratio to determine the
unknown number of moles.
n(CO2) = 3 × n(C3H8)

m(CO2) = n(CO2) × M(CO2)

Mass–volume stoichiometry
Mass–volume stoichiometry is similar to mass–mass stoichiometry except we are interested in
the volume of product produced from a given mass of reactant or vice versa. To calculate this
correctly, we need to determine the number of moles of the substance we are given information

Volume–volume stoichiometry
Volume–volume stoichiometry is similar to mass–mass stoichiometry and mass–volume
stoichiometry except we’re interested in the volume of a gaseous product from a given
volume of gaseous reactant or vice versa. If the following conditions are met, we can skip
some steps in the overall process.
1 The system is a closed system. A closed system is one in which energy can be transferred
between the reaction and the surroundings, but matter cannot. This is discussed further
in Section 5A.
2 The pressure is kept constant.
3 The temperature is kept constant.
If these conditions are met, then the ratio of gas volumes is identical to the mole ratios and
the coefficients in the reaction equation also apply for volume. For example, consider the
following equation:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)

Calculations involving limiting and excess reagents
Determining whether a reactant is limiting, or in excess, was covered in Section 1C.
Here we’ll look at how this can apply to questions involving greenhouse gases.
Consider Worked example 2A–7 below. There are really two questions here:
• Which of the reagents is limiting, and therefore, which one is in excess? (This is shown
in Steps 1–4.)
• What is the mass of methane gas formed? (You need to know which is limiting to
calculate which is in excess. This is shown in Steps 5–7.)

Identifying limiting reagents
In this section, you have learned more about calculations that require you to identify the limiting reagent
in combustion reactions. As described in the text, this involves calculating the number of moles of each
reactant and applying stoichiometric ratios to determine which is in excess and which is limiting.
When the stoichiometric ratio is 1 : 1, this is a relatively simple process whereby the reagent with the lowest
number of moles is limiting. However, it can become trickier when other stoichiometric ratios are involved.
To help with that, there are many tips and strategies that people employ to make sure they solve the
problem correctly. It is important that you find a method that makes sense and works well for you, but we
will describe one below that you may find useful. It can be summarised as follows.
Strategy: Once you have calculated the number of moles of each reactant, divide that value by the
stoichiometric coefficient from the equation. Whichever number is lower after you do this will correspond
to the limiting reagent.

To understand this better, let’s look at an example. In this instance, we won’t go through the process of
calculating the number of moles, we will just provide them in the question.
Question: The combustion of ethane can be represented by the following balanced equation:
2C2H6(g) + 7O2(g) → 4CO2(g) +6H2O(g)
If 0.5 moles of ethane reacts with 2.1 moles of oxygen, which is the limiting reagent?
Solution: Using the strategy that we have above, we can set out our calculation as follows.
C2H6 O2
Number of moles (n) 0.5 2.1
Stoichiometric coefficient 2 7
2.1
7 = 0.3
0.5
2 = 0.25 Therefore, C2H6 is the limiting reagent as it has the lowest value after dividing the number of moles by the
stoichiometric coefficient.
Go back over some practice questions that you have done involving a limiting reagent and use this method
to see if it helps.

Guinea pigs: nature’s calorimeter?
In 1789, Antione Lavoisier conducted a series of experiments
on guinea pigs. These are not the experiments for which he
was famed and which led to the discovery of the principle of
conservation of mass but, equally, they’re not far off. Lavoisier
was able to measure the heat of respiration by guinea pigs
and, in doing so, also invented the world’s first calorimeter,
a device for detecting the energy change in a chemical
reaction. He did this by placing the guinea pigs in a small ice
calorimeter (a container inside another container that’s filled
with ice) and measured how much ice was melted. He then
used this to determine the amount of energy produced by
the guinea pigs and their rate of respiration. Therefore, the
guinea pigs themselves were not the calorimeter, but they
were useful test subjects in determining the energy produced
when animals undergo respiration.

Measuring energy from fuels
In Section 1C and Section 2A, we discussed the release of energy from the combustion
reaction of fuels using thermochemical equations. However, what hasn’t yet been discussed
is how these energy values are calculated. To do this experimentally, it is useful to be able
to utilise a material known for its energy storage properties – water. Water is excellent for
measuring energy changes as it has a uniquely high specific heat capacity. We remember
from Unit 2 that the specific heat capacity of a material is the energy required to raise the
temperature of one gram of a given substance by one degree Celsius.

As Table 2B–1 shows, liquid water stands out in its ability to store energy with little change

From this, we can understand that a relatively large quantity of energy is required to raise
the temperature of water, but how does that help us determine the actual quantity of energy
released from the combustion of fuels? The answer lies in the use of the following formula,
which links together energy (q) with the specific heat capacity (c):
q = mcΔT
where:
q = The energy produced or used in joules
c = The specific heat capacity in J g–1°C–1

Calorimetry
an experimental
method by which
the heat energy
of food or a fuel
is measured
Calorimetry
To measure the quantity of energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction, we use a
technique called calorimetry. The analytical equipment used to perform calorimetry is the
calorimeter. All calorimeters have the same goals in their design:
• isolate the reaction taking place
• have well insulated walls
• have a reference material to reduce the effects of imperfect isolation
• use stirrers to ensure that temperatures measured are even
• use thermometers to measure the temperature in the calorimeter
• have negligible heat capacity (or a known accurate heat capacity), so the loss of heat in
heating the calorimeter can be taken into account.
One such technique, which can be used to measure the energy contained within food or
fuel, is known as simple calorimetry. The experimental set-up for simple calorimetry is
shown in Figure 2B–2.
Thermometer
Metal can
Water
Spirit burner
Fuel
Figure 2B–2 A simple calorimetry set-up like this can be used for measuring
the quantity of energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction.
In these experiments, the fuel or food is burned (or combusted) above a spirit burner that
is positioned beneath a container filled with water. As the fuel or food is burned, energy is
released. The energy that is released will gradually heat the water in the container. Using
the equation, q = mcΔT, above, the change in temperature can be used to calculate the
quantity of energy that is released from the fuel source.
The basic experimental procedure for this follows these steps:
1 Accurately measure and record the mass of water added to the metal can.
2 Record the initial temperature of the water.
3 Weigh your fuel source and place into the spirit burner.
4 Light the spirit burner.
5 Using the thermometer, record the change in temperature of the water over time.
6 Stop heating the water before all the fuel has been used and well before the water boils.
To help understand how this can be used to measure energy, let’s consider Worked
example 2B–2.

Solution calorimetry
Solution calorimeters measure the enthalpies associated with reactions that occur in
solution, including heat of precipitation, heat of solution and heat of neutralisation.
These reactions can be endothermic or exothermic. The container is thermally insulated,
preventing heat loss to the surroundings. Gas samples can be measured through solution
calorimetry using an ampoule. Ampoules are small (typically glass) sealed containers that
are used to preserve samples but can be broken open to release their sample safely.

Energy transformation efficiency
DOC
As the experimental set-up on page 54 suggests, the fuel in the spirit burner is undergoing
combustion and the heat energy produced is being used to heat the water. However,
this process is not 100% efficient. There are several reasons that can contribute to a
reduced efficiency, such as heat being lost to the surrounding environment or incomplete
combustion. By calculating the thermal energy absorbed by the water, as described in the
examples above and on page 55, and then comparing this to the known theoretical enthalpy
of combustion of the fuel being used, it is possible to calculate the energy transformation
efficiency. This is highlighted through Worked example 2B–4.

m(H2O) = 100.0 g
c(H2O) = 4.18 J g–1°C–1

q = mcΔT
q = 100.0 g × 4.18 J g–1°C–1 × 37.2°C
q = 15549.6 J = 15.5 kJ
Step 3 Calculate the theoretical
maximum energy released by
the ethanol using the VCAA
Data Book.
m(C2H5OH) = 1.5 g
ΔH°c (C2H5OH) = 29.6 kJ g–1

Calibrating a calorimeter
To help reduce systematic errors, calibration of the apparatus is performed before each
experiment.
This can be done by either using a known chemical reference material such as a metal or a
well-studied compound like potassium chloride, or by using an electric heating element as a
known provider of energy based on the power supply.
Chemical calibration
Chemicals with well-characterised enthalpies of dissolution are often used as reference
materials for solution calorimetry. Potassium chloride is a common reference material, as it is
solid at room temperature and has a well-characterised enthalpy of dissolution of 17.2 kJ mol–1
.
For calibration to occur, a known amount of potassium chloride is placed
in the calorimeter and dissolved. The temperature change is recorded. We
then use two equations to determine the calibration factor:
E = n × ΔH
c
Calibration factor = E
ΔT
where:
E = The energy released in kilojoules
n = The number of moles of reference material
ΔHC = The heat of combustion for the reference material
ΔT = The change in temperature recorded.
Calibration factor may also be written as CF.

Calorimeters can also be calibrated electrically, as the heating element that heats the
solution has a constant power supply from the socket. This means that you can link
the energy produced by the element to a change in temperature of the water within the
calorimeter. The energy produced from electricity passing through the heating element is
calculated from the following equation:
E = V × I × t
where:
E = The energy produced in joules
V = The voltage in volts
I = The current in amperes

Figure 2B–5 These graphs show the results of two experiments to determine the calibration factor by
electrical methods. The current is turned on at 60 seconds and turned off at 360 seconds. In graph A,
the change in temperature can be read accurately; however, in graph B an extrapolation back to the
point where the current was turned on is required via a line of best fit.
If you know the calibration factor for a calorimeter, the results for energy changes you
produce will be more accurate. This allows us to put together a complete procedure for
using a calorimeter and getting the best possible results with minimal experimental error.
Overall experimental process
Earlier in the chapter, we looked at calculating the energy produced from combustion reactions
using simple calorimeters and from other types of reactions using solution calorimetry.
However, as we’ve just seen, we also need to ensure the calorimeter is calibrated before making
the measurement. This means our overall process for performing a calorimetric measurement
to determine the enthalpy change of a reaction should be as follows:
1 Calibrate your calorimeter using the most appropriate method.
2 Perform your experiment.
3 Interpret your data.
4 Perform your calculations to determine the calibration factor, CF.
5 Use the calibration factor to determine ΔH.

EXAMPLE 2B–7
A solution calorimeter containing 150.0 mL of distilled water at 25.00°C is calibrated
electrically by applying a potential difference of 4.00 V of electricity and a current of
2.00 A passed through the electric heater for 60.0 seconds, causing the temperature to
increase to 26.50°C. The distilled water was then removed and replaced with 75.0 mL
of 0.150 M hydrochloric acid and 75.0 mL of 0.100 M sodium hydroxide, which were
both at an initial temperature of 22.0°C. The temperature of the solution increased to
23.23°C. Calculate the energy released, in kJ, by the neutralisation reaction between
hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide.

2B SKILLS
Random versus systematic errors
In the context of chemistry, particularly in an experiment such as calorimetry, two types
of errors commonly occur: random and systematic.
Random errors occur unpredictably and differ in each measurement. They’re caused
by unpredictable fluctuations in the experimental process, such as variations in
temperature, slight inconsistencies in material, or even human error during observation.
In a calorimetry experiment, a random error could be the minor fluctuation in the
temperature readings of the calorimeter. While these errors can’t be completely
eliminated, they can be minimised by conducting multiple trials and calculating an
average result.
On the other hand, systematic errors are predictable and consistent in each
measurement. They’re caused by faulty equipment, incorrect calibration or bias in
the method of measurement. For instance, if the calorimeter isn’t perfectly insulated,
heat may escape or enter, leading to a consistent underestimation or overestimation of
energy changes in the system, respectively. This is a systematic error. Systematic errors
can be identified because they skew results in a particular direction and their effect
remains consistent irrespective of the number of trials. To eliminate systematic errors,
equipment should be properly calibrated, and methods should be evaluated and adjusted
if necessary.
The difference between these two types of errors can be demonstrated visually, as shown
below.
Systematic error
Actual value
Random error
Therefore, while both random and systematic errors affect the accuracy of experimental
results, they have different sources and strategies for minimisation or elimination. The
identification and understanding of these errors are key to improving the reliability and
validity of experimental outcomes.
We can also look at these through a question, in which you might be asked to identify
the type of error that has occurred.
Question: During a calorimetry experiment to determine the energy released from the
combustion of a fuel, the recorded temperature change is consistently lower than the
expected value. Is this error likely to be random or systematic? Provide some potential
sources of the error.

Answer: The consistently lower temperature change observed in the calorimetry
experiment suggests that the error is likely to be systematic rather than random.
Systematic errors are characterised by consistent deviations in the same direction and
magnitude. In this case, the lower recorded temperature change indicates a systematic bias
that may be attributed to a flaw in the experimental set-up or procedure. It is important
to carefully examine factors such as insulation, calorimeter calibration, heat loss and
combustion efficiency to identify and rectify the source of this systematic error. By
addressing the underlying issue causing the consistent deviation, scientists can improve
the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained from the calorimetry experiment.

Measuring energy from food
2C
Study Design:
• energy from fuels and food:
• calculation of energy transformation efficiency during combustion as a
percentage of chemical energy converted to useful energy
• comparison and calculations of energy values of foods containing carbohydrates,
proteins and fats and oils
ENGAGE
Energy: It’s all in a label
When we think of food packaging, we usually think of brands, logos and advertisements.
However, did you know that food packaging has a major legal responsibility to provide
consumers with the information available to them around the energy provided in
a food? Not only do labels provide us with a list of ingredients, they also provide us
with the energy content information of the product. This allows us to make informed
choices about the nutritional value of food, as well as the way the energy in food is being
provided. This is because different food types provide energy differently, depending on
the make-up of proteins, fats and carbohydrates within the food.
Figure 2C–1 A medium cheeseburger meal (left) provides 3515 kJ of energy, whereas a regular
Acai bowl (right) provides 1760 kJ.
EXPLAIN
Food: a biochemical energy source
While we often think of food in terms of taste, our body views food as energy. When
digested, the main food groups are broken down into smaller molecules that can be
used directly as a source of energy or stored for later use. While we do also use food for
structural components associated with growth, repair and daily function, food still comes
down to the balance between energy taken in and energy used in the activities of daily life.
The main nutrients are carbohydrates, fats and proteins. As all of these groups are
comprised of a mixture of different substances (for example, proteins refers to a number
of different proteins, not a ‘pure’ protein), we measure energy value in food in kJ g–1, not
kJ mol–1 as we did with energy from reactions in the previous section. Equally, just because
a nutrient has a certain energy content doesn’t mean that the energy can be fully extracted
from that food. This is shown in Table 2C–1.

different food groups
Nutrient Heat of
combustion (kJ g–1)
Fats and oils 37
Proteins 17
Carbohydrates The heat of combustion assumes we are completely burning the
nutrient in an environment containing excess oxygen. The energy
value, however, can be less than expected and can be due to factors
such as the following:
• Cellulose can be combusted to release energy, but the human
body can’t metabolise or digest it.
16
• Nutrients move through the digestive system too fast for all of the
carbohydrates, fats and proteins to be absorbed.
These factors help us understand why sugars are excellent for quick energy, whereas
proteins are used for energy only when other sources are not readily available.
Table 2C–2 The composition of common foods
We also need to remember that foods
themselves are mixtures of these different
nutrients and as such offer us different energy
amounts in different ways. This is illustrated
with different examples in Table 2C–2. One
thing that you may notice about this table is
that the values don’t add up to 100%. This is
1.7 6.5 29
because there are other substances in the food
that don’t contribute to the energy content
(such as water and cellulose), which have been omitted.
We can then combine the information contained within Table 2C–1 and Table 2C–2 to
provide an estimation for the overall energy content of food. The process for doing this is
explained in Worked example 2C–1.

Solution
Logic Refer to tables to determine the
available energy for the nutrients
in the nuts.
Process
Fats = 37 kJ g–1
Proteins = 17 kJ g–1
Carbohydrates = 16 kJ g–1
Step 1 Step 2 Convert the percentages to
a mass assuming 100 g is
equivalent to 100% and multiply
by energy availability.
Fats = 37 kJ g–1 × 52.0 g
= 1924 kJ
Proteins = 17 kJ g–1 × 6.0 g
= 102 kJ
Carbohydrates = 16 kJ g–1 × 21.0 g
= 336 kJ
Step 3 Add all available energy. Total energy = 1924 kJ + 102 kJ + 336 kJ

Significant figures
At the end of any calculation question in chemistry, you should check two things: units
and significant figures. It is frustrating to have done your working out correctly and
obtained the right value, only to lose marks because you haven’t included (or have used
the wrong) units or written your answer to the correct number of significant figures.
Depending on the assessment, you may lose marks every time you do this ... so these
mistakes can really add up!
In terms of significant figures, there are a few rules that you should know:
1 Any digit that isn’t a zero is significant (for example, 19.782 has five significant
figures).
2 Any zero that is found between two significant numbers is significant (for example,
19.702 has five significant figures).
3 After the decimal point, a zero that doesn’t come between two significant numbers
is only significant if it comes at the end (for example, 0.78200 has five significant
figures, whereas 0.00782 has three significant figures).
If you are multiplying or dividing, you consider all significant figures provided in the
question. For your answer, you will use the same number of significant figures as the
value in the question that contains the LEAST number of significant figures (not just
after the decimal point).
Let’s do an example.
Question: Multiply the following values: 54.7 and 0.02.
Answer: 1.094. However, our answer should use the smallest number of significant
figures in the question. Therefore, our actual answer is 1 (because 0.02 is only one
significant figure).
If you are adding or subtracting, the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in
the answer will be the same as the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in
the number with the fewest digits to the right of the decimal point.
Let’s look at the question above, but instead of multiplying the values, we will add them.
Question: Add the following values: 54.7 and 0.02.
Answer: 54.72. However, our answer should only include one digit to the right of the
decimal point, as this is the fewest provided in the question. Therefore, our actual
answer is 54.7.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can distinguish between random and systematic errors in calorimetry
CODE: 2B.9

WHAT (concept explanation):
Random errors cause unpredictable variations in measurements (like minor temperature fluctuations), while systematic errors cause consistent deviations in one direction (like heat loss through poor insulation).

WHY (importance):
Understanding error types guides experimental improvement strategies, as random errors are reduced by repeated trials while systematic errors require changes to equipment or procedure.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Consistently low temperature readings indicate systematic error from heat loss, while temperature readings varying randomly around the mean indicate random measurement error.

SUBTOPIC: Calorimetry Principles
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores experimental techniques for measuring heat energy changes in chemical reactions using calorimeters. It covers the specific heat capacity equation, calibration procedures using electrical and chemical methods, and analysis of temperature-time graphs to determine energy transformations.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Calorimetry provides experimental verification of theoretical energy values and allows measurement of heat released from fuels and foods. Understanding calibration and heat loss effects ensures accurate energy measurements, which are essential for fuel efficiency analysis and food energy labeling.

TOPIC: Measuring Changes in Chemical Reactions
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Quantitative analysis of combustion reactions including stoichiometric calculations for greenhouse gas emissions, calorimetry techniques for measuring energy release, and determination of energy content in fuels and foods.

Introduction
Energy is involved in almost every aspect of our lives. The food we eat for
breakfast, lunch and dinner provides our bodies with the energy that they need
to function. The petrol that we use to fill up our cars and motorbikes provides
the energy that they need to run. Electrical energy powers all our equipment
and devices, lights up our homes and helps us communicate all over the world.
In this chapter, we will focus on the energy that is generated from the chemical
reactions involving fuel and food. You will apply stoichiometry to a real-world
problem – the emission of greenhouse gases – and learn how to quantitate the energy
produced from combustion reactions.

ENGAGE
Lowering greenhouse gas emissions for global security
In 2015, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change held a summit in Paris that set down a landmark treaty
on greenhouse gas emissions targets that was supported by 196 member nations. In
November 2016, that treaty was ratified and became legally binding. The goal is to limit
global warming to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels and reach peak greenhouse
gas production as soon as possible.
In 2020, countries submitted their plans to reach their peak targets and the global
warming limit. While COP27, held in Egypt in 2022, revealed the political difficulties in
meeting the 1.5°C target, the 2015 Paris Agreement set the wheels in motion for many
countries to set low-carbon solutions, carbon economies and carbon neutrality targets,
all in the name of reaching this goal. This has led to new jobs, new industries and the
hope that by 2030 zero-carbon solutions could be viable options in sectors that currently
represent 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

EXPLAIN
Greenhouse gases and chemical reactions
Before beginning to explore chemical reactions in more depth, let’s first refresh our
understanding of how greenhouse gases are produced.
Combustion reactions
As you learned in Section 1C, combustion reactions occur when a hydrocarbon is burned
in the presence of oxygen. This results in the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
water vapour (H2O), which are greenhouse gases. Other well-known greenhouse gases
include nitrous oxide (N2O), ozone (O3) and methane (CH4). Methane is emitted during
the extraction and transport of natural gas, as well as from livestock and other agricultural
activities. These gases allow sunlight to pass through Earth’s atmosphere, but they trap the
heat that is reflected from the surface, preventing it from radiating out into space. This
process is known as the greenhouse effect, and it is what makes Earth warm enough to
support life as we know it.

Figure 2A–2 A representation of the natural greenhouse effect
However, an increase of these gases, particularly the ones caused by human activity,
such as CO2 and CH4, causes an enhancement of the greenhouse effect, known as the
enhanced greenhouse effect, which leads to global warming and climate change. Being able
to calculate how much greenhouse gas will be produced from a reaction is therefore critical
in determining the suitability of a reaction or process in line with the societal goals of
decreasing global warming.
When writing combustion reactions, it is also standard practice to state the enthalpy of the
given reaction.

Common combustion reactions
There are several common reactions that produce different greenhouse gases. Carbon
dioxide (CO2) is produced when fossil fuels, such as coal, petrol and natural gas, are burned
for energy. For example, the combustion of octane in a car engine has the equation:
2C8H18(l) + 25O2(g) → 16CO2(g) + 18H2O(l) ΔH = –10 920 kJ mol–1
Not all combustion reactions go to completion. For example, carbon monoxide (CO)
is produced when fuels burn incompletely. For incomplete combustion reactions, the
enthalpy value can vary depending on the conditions. This is because ‘imperfect’ conditions,
such as a lack of oxygen or low temperatures, can lead to incomplete combustion.
Determining heat energy production from the combustion of fuels
Combustion is the chemical process that produces heat energy from the oxidation of fuels.
We can experience the benefits directly around an open fire or indirectly in powering
our homes and vehicles, where the energy from combusted fuels drives other processes.
Combustion reactions are always exothermic – that is, they release heat energy.
To determine the energy released from the combustion of some fuels, we can use the
reference tables found in the VCAA Data book for ‘Molar heat of combustion’, measured in
kJ mol–1, as shown below.

While heat energy transformation into other forms isn’t 100% efficient, a large portion
of this energy produced from combustion reactions can be put to use. Depending on the
amount of fuel available, which is expressed in moles, a certain amount of energy can be
released, as shown in Worked example 2A–1 on the following page.

EXAMPLE 2A–1
Worked example 2A–1: Calculating heat energy produced from burning
a fuel sample
A 100.0 kg quantity of ethanol, C2H5OH, is burned in an industrial stove with an open
air-intake. How much energy, in MJ, will be produced if all the ethanol is burned?
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write down the information that you
have about the known substance.
Process
m(C2H5OH) = 100.0 kg = 100000 g
M(C2H5OH) = 46.0 gmol–1
n(C2H5OH) = ?
Step 2 Calculate the amount of substance
being combusted in moles. m(C2H5OH)
n(C2H5OH) =
M(C2H5OH)
= 100000 g
46.0 g mol–1
= 2173.9 mol
Step 3 Determine the energy produced by
multiplying n(C2H5OH) by the molar
heat of combustion of ethanol.
E = 1360 kJmol–1 × 2173.9 mol
= 2956504 kJ

Special conditions of stoichiometry
The amount of energy emitted or required for a reaction can vary considerably, as can
the amount of greenhouse gas produced. It is important to consider two things here:
• The energy value of the enthalpy is in kilojoules.
• The amounts are ‘per mole’ of reference material.
This last point should help us realise how important stoichiometry will be to success in
calculations of greenhouse gas emissions. To do this, we must first be able to successfully
calculations of greenhouse gas emissions. To do this, we must first be able to successfully
balance an equation.

Converting stoichiometrically from different units
In addition to basic calculations, there are times when we don’t need to convert to/from
the amount in moles, n, and we can convert stoichiometrically from different units. This is
represented diagrammatically in Figure 2A–3.

EXAMPLE 2A–2
When 0.5 mole of pentane is burned in excess oxygen, how many moles of carbon

Solution
Logic Write a balanced equation for
the reaction.
Step 1 Process
C5H12(g) + 8O2(g) → 5CO2(g) + 6H2O(g)
Step 2 Write down the information that you
have about the known substance.
n(C5H12) = 0.5 mol
Step 3 Determine the stoichiometric ratio
from the equation.
From the equation, the coefficient of
pentane is 1 and CO2 is 5.
n(C5H12) : n(CO2) = 1 : 5
Step 4 Use the stoichiometric ratio to
determine the amount of unknown
substance.
5 times the amount of CO2 is produced per
amount of pentane
∴ n(CO2) = 5 × n(C5H12) = 5 × 0.5 = 2.5 mol

WORKED
EXAMPLE 2A–3
Worked example 2A–3: Calculating the moles of product in combustion
When 11 moles of octane are completely combusted in oxygen, how many moles of
water are produced?
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write a balanced equation for
the reaction.
Process
2C8H18(g) + 25O2(g) → 16CO2(g) + 18H2O(l)
Step 2 Write down the information

substance.
n(C8H18) = 11 mol
Step 3 Determine the stoichiometric ratio
from the equation.
From the equations, the number in front of
octane is 2 and 18 for H2O.
n(C8H18) : n(H2O) = 2 : 18 = 1 : 9
Step 4 Use the stoichiometric ratio to
determine the amount of unknown

n(H2O) = 9 × n(C8H18)

Mass–mass stoichiometry
For mass–mass stoichiometry, we’re interested in the mass of product produced from a
given mass of reactant or vice versa. To calculate this successfully, we need to determine
the number of moles of the substance we have information for and then follow our ‘down,
across, up’ process, as shown in Figure 2A–3.
1 Convert the given mass of a substance to moles using n =
m
M.
2 Use the mole ratio in the thermochemical equation to determine the moles of the
substance of interest.
3 Calculate the mass of the substance of interest from the moles determined in Step 2
using m = n × M.
This is still making use of the techniques learned earlier but with a specific strategy for
mass–mass questions. We see this in action in Worked example 2A–4.

Step 4 Determine the stoichiometric

From the equations, the number before
propane is 1 and CO2 is 3.
n(C3H8) : n(CO2) = 1 : 3
Step 5 Use the ratio to determine the
unknown number of moles.
n(CO2) = 3 × n(C3H8)

Mass–volume stoichiometry
Mass–volume stoichiometry is similar to mass–mass stoichiometry except we are interested in

Volume–volume stoichiometry
Volume–volume stoichiometry is similar to mass–mass stoichiometry and mass–volume
stoichiometry except we’re interested in the volume of a gaseous product from a given
volume of gaseous reactant or vice versa. If the following conditions are met, we can skip
some steps in the overall process.
1 The system is a closed system. A closed system is one in which energy can be transferred
between the reaction and the surroundings, but matter cannot. This is discussed further
in Section 5A.
2 The pressure is kept constant.
3 The temperature is kept constant.
If these conditions are met, then the ratio of gas volumes is identical to the mole ratios and
the coefficients in the reaction equation also apply for volume. For example, consider the
following equation:

Identifying limiting reagents
In this section, you have learned more about calculations that require you to identify the limiting reagent
in combustion reactions. As described in the text, this involves calculating the number of moles of each
reactant and applying stoichiometric ratios to determine which is in excess and which is limiting.
When the stoichiometric ratio is 1 : 1, this is a relatively simple process whereby the reagent with the lowest
number of moles is limiting. However, it can become trickier when other stoichiometric ratios are involved.
To help with that, there are many tips and strategies that people employ to make sure they solve the
problem correctly. It is important that you find a method that makes sense and works well for you, but we
will describe one below that you may find useful. It can be summarised as follows.
Strategy: Once you have calculated the number of moles of each reactant, divide that value by the
stoichiometric coefficient from the equation. Whichever number is lower after you do this will correspond
to the limiting reagent.

To understand this better, let’s look at an example. In this instance, we won’t go through the process of
calculating the number of moles, we will just provide them in the question.
Question: The combustion of ethane can be represented by the following balanced equation:
2C2H6(g) + 7O2(g) → 4CO2(g) +6H2O(g)
If 0.5 moles of ethane reacts with 2.1 moles of oxygen, which is the limiting reagent?
Solution: Using the strategy that we have above, we can set out our calculation as follows.
C2H6 O2
Number of moles (n) 0.5 2.1
Stoichiometric coefficient 2 7
2.1
7 = 0.3
0.5
2 = 0.25 Therefore, C2H6 is the limiting reagent as it has the lowest value after dividing the number of moles by the
stoichiometric coefficient.
Go back over some practice questions that you have done involving a limiting reagent and use this method
to see if it helps.

Guinea pigs: nature’s calorimeter?
In 1789, Antione Lavoisier conducted a series of experiments
on guinea pigs. These are not the experiments for which he
was famed and which led to the discovery of the principle of
conservation of mass but, equally, they’re not far off. Lavoisier
was able to measure the heat of respiration by guinea pigs
and, in doing so, also invented the world’s first calorimeter,
a device for detecting the energy change in a chemical
reaction. He did this by placing the guinea pigs in a small ice
calorimeter (a container inside another container that’s filled
with ice) and measured how much ice was melted. He then
used this to determine the amount of energy produced by
the guinea pigs and their rate of respiration. Therefore, the
guinea pigs themselves were not the calorimeter, but they
were useful test subjects in determining the energy produced
when animals undergo respiration.

Measuring energy from fuels
In Section 1C and Section 2A, we discussed the release of energy from the combustion
reaction of fuels using thermochemical equations. However, what hasn’t yet been discussed
is how these energy values are calculated. To do this experimentally, it is useful to be able
to utilise a material known for its energy storage properties – water. Water is excellent for
measuring energy changes as it has a uniquely high specific heat capacity. We remember
from Unit 2 that the specific heat capacity of a material is the energy required to raise the
temperature of one gram of a given substance by one degree Celsius.

As Table 2B–1 shows, liquid water stands out in its ability to store energy with little change

From this, we can understand that a relatively large quantity of energy is required to raise
the temperature of water, but how does that help us determine the actual quantity of energy
released from the combustion of fuels? The answer lies in the use of the following formula,
which links together energy (q) with the specific heat capacity (c):
q = mcΔT
where:
q = The energy produced or used in joules
c = The specific heat capacity in J g–1°C–1

Calorimetry
an experimental
method by which
the heat energy
of food or a fuel
is measured
Calorimetry
To measure the quantity of energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction, we use a
technique called calorimetry. The analytical equipment used to perform calorimetry is the
calorimeter. All calorimeters have the same goals in their design:
• isolate the reaction taking place
• have well insulated walls
• have a reference material to reduce the effects of imperfect isolation
• use stirrers to ensure that temperatures measured are even
• use thermometers to measure the temperature in the calorimeter
• have negligible heat capacity (or a known accurate heat capacity), so the loss of heat in
heating the calorimeter can be taken into account.
One such technique, which can be used to measure the energy contained within food or
fuel, is known as simple calorimetry. The experimental set-up for simple calorimetry is
shown in Figure 2B–2.
Thermometer
Metal can
Water
Spirit burner
Fuel
Figure 2B–2 A simple calorimetry set-up like this can be used for measuring
the quantity of energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction.
In these experiments, the fuel or food is burned (or combusted) above a spirit burner that
is positioned beneath a container filled with water. As the fuel or food is burned, energy is
released. The energy that is released will gradually heat the water in the container. Using
the equation, q = mcΔT, above, the change in temperature can be used to calculate the
quantity of energy that is released from the fuel source.
The basic experimental procedure for this follows these steps:
1 Accurately measure and record the mass of water added to the metal can.
2 Record the initial temperature of the water.
3 Weigh your fuel source and place into the spirit burner.
4 Light the spirit burner.
5 Using the thermometer, record the change in temperature of the water over time.
6 Stop heating the water before all the fuel has been used and well before the water boils.
To help understand how this can be used to measure energy, let’s consider Worked

Solution calorimeters measure the enthalpies associated with reactions that occur in
solution, including heat of precipitation, heat of solution and heat of neutralisation.
These reactions can be endothermic or exothermic. The container is thermally insulated,
preventing heat loss to the surroundings. Gas samples can be measured through solution
calorimetry using an ampoule. Ampoules are small (typically glass) sealed containers that
are used to preserve samples but can be broken open to release their sample safely.

As the experimental set-up on page 54 suggests, the fuel in the spirit burner is undergoing
combustion and the heat energy produced is being used to heat the water. However,
this process is not 100% efficient. There are several reasons that can contribute to a
reduced efficiency, such as heat being lost to the surrounding environment or incomplete
combustion. By calculating the thermal energy absorbed by the water, as described in the
examples above and on page 55, and then comparing this to the known theoretical enthalpy
of combustion of the fuel being used, it is possible to calculate the energy transformation
efficiency. This is highlighted through Worked example 2B–4.

c(H2O) = 4.18 J g–1°C–1
ΔT = 57.4°C – 20.2°C = 37.2°C
m(C2H5OH) = 1.5 g
Step 2 Calculate the energy used to
heat the water, using q = mcΔT.
q = mcΔT
q = 100.0 g × 4.18 J g–1°C–1 × 37.2°C
q = 15549.6 J = 15.5 kJ
Step 3 Calculate the theoretical
maximum energy released by
the ethanol using the VCAA

m(C2H5OH) = 1.5 g
ΔH°c (C2H5OH) = 29.6 kJ g–1
ΔH(C2H5OH) = 1.5 g × 29.6 kJ g–1
= 44.4 kJ
Step 4 Calculate the percentage
efficiency using % efficiency =

theoretical value × 100
% efficiency = 15.5 kJ
44.4 kJ × 100

Calibrating a calorimeter
To help reduce systematic errors, calibration of the apparatus is performed before each
experiment.
This can be done by either using a known chemical reference material such as a metal or a
well-studied compound like potassium chloride, or by using an electric heating element as a
known provider of energy based on the power supply.
Chemical calibration
Chemicals with well-characterised enthalpies of dissolution are often used as reference
materials for solution calorimetry. Potassium chloride is a common reference material, as it is
solid at room temperature and has a well-characterised enthalpy of dissolution of 17.2 kJ mol–1
.
For calibration to occur, a known amount of potassium chloride is placed
in the calorimeter and dissolved. The temperature change is recorded. We
then use two equations to determine the calibration factor:
E = n × ΔH
c
Calibration factor = E
ΔT
where:
E = The energy released in kilojoules
n = The number of moles of reference material
ΔHC = The heat of combustion for the reference material
ΔT = The change in temperature recorded.
Calibration factor may also be written as CF.

Electrical calibration
Calorimeters can also be calibrated electrically, as the heating element that heats the
solution has a constant power supply from the socket. This means that you can link
the energy produced by the element to a change in temperature of the water within the
calorimeter. The energy produced from electricity passing through the heating element is
calculated from the following equation:
E = V × I × t
where:
E = The energy produced in joules
V = The voltage in volts
I = The current in amperes
t = The time in seconds.

If you know the calibration factor for a calorimeter, the results for energy changes you
produce will be more accurate. This allows us to put together a complete procedure for
using a calorimeter and getting the best possible results with minimal experimental error.
Overall experimental process
Earlier in the chapter, we looked at calculating the energy produced from combustion reactions
using simple calorimeters and from other types of reactions using solution calorimetry.
However, as we’ve just seen, we also need to ensure the calorimeter is calibrated before making
the measurement. This means our overall process for performing a calorimetric measurement
to determine the enthalpy change of a reaction should be as follows:
1 Calibrate your calorimeter using the most appropriate method.
2 Perform your experiment.
3 Interpret your data.
4 Perform your calculations to determine the calibration factor, CF.
5 Use the calibration factor to determine ΔH.

2B SKILLS
Random versus systematic errors
In the context of chemistry, particularly in an experiment such as calorimetry, two types
of errors commonly occur: random and systematic.
Random errors occur unpredictably and differ in each measurement. They’re caused
by unpredictable fluctuations in the experimental process, such as variations in
temperature, slight inconsistencies in material, or even human error during observation.
In a calorimetry experiment, a random error could be the minor fluctuation in the
temperature readings of the calorimeter. While these errors can’t be completely
eliminated, they can be minimised by conducting multiple trials and calculating an
average result.
On the other hand, systematic errors are predictable and consistent in each
measurement. They’re caused by faulty equipment, incorrect calibration or bias in
the method of measurement. For instance, if the calorimeter isn’t perfectly insulated,
heat may escape or enter, leading to a consistent underestimation or overestimation of
energy changes in the system, respectively. This is a systematic error. Systematic errors
can be identified because they skew results in a particular direction and their effect
remains consistent irrespective of the number of trials. To eliminate systematic errors,
equipment should be properly calibrated, and methods should be evaluated and adjusted
if necessary.
The difference between these two types of errors can be demonstrated visually, as shown
below.
Systematic error
Actual value
Random error
Therefore, while both random and systematic errors affect the accuracy of experimental
results, they have different sources and strategies for minimisation or elimination. The
identification and understanding of these errors are key to improving the reliability and
validity of experimental outcomes.
We can also look at these through a question, in which you might be asked to identify
the type of error that has occurred.
Question: During a calorimetry experiment to determine the energy released from the
combustion of a fuel, the recorded temperature change is consistently lower than the
expected value. Is this error likely to be random or systematic? Provide some potential
sources of the error.

Answer: The consistently lower temperature change observed in the calorimetry
experiment suggests that the error is likely to be systematic rather than random.
Systematic errors are characterised by consistent deviations in the same direction and
magnitude. In this case, the lower recorded temperature change indicates a systematic bias
that may be attributed to a flaw in the experimental set-up or procedure. It is important
to carefully examine factors such as insulation, calorimeter calibration, heat loss and
combustion efficiency to identify and rectify the source of this systematic error. By
addressing the underlying issue causing the consistent deviation, scientists can improve
the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained from the calorimetry experiment.

ENGAGE
Energy: It’s all in a label
When we think of food packaging, we usually think of brands, logos and advertisements.
However, did you know that food packaging has a major legal responsibility to provide
consumers with the information available to them around the energy provided in
a food? Not only do labels provide us with a list of ingredients, they also provide us
with the energy content information of the product. This allows us to make informed
choices about the nutritional value of food, as well as the way the energy in food is being
provided. This is because different food types provide energy differently, depending on
the make-up of proteins, fats and carbohydrates within the food.
Figure 2C–1 A medium cheeseburger meal (left) provides 3515 kJ of energy, whereas a regular
Acai bowl (right) provides 1760 kJ.
EXPLAIN
Food: a biochemical energy source
While we often think of food in terms of taste, our body views food as energy. When
digested, the main food groups are broken down into smaller molecules that can be
used directly as a source of energy or stored for later use. While we do also use food for
structural components associated with growth, repair and daily function, food still comes
down to the balance between energy taken in and energy used in the activities of daily life.
The main nutrients are carbohydrates, fats and proteins. As all of these groups are
comprised of a mixture of different substances (for example, proteins refers to a number
of different proteins, not a ‘pure’ protein), we measure energy value in food in kJ g–1, not
kJ mol–1 as we did with energy from reactions in the previous section. Equally, just because
a nutrient has a certain energy content doesn’t mean that the energy can be fully extracted
from that food. This is shown in Table 2C–1.

Nutrient Heat of
combustion (kJ g–1)
Fats and oils 37
Proteins 17
Carbohydrates The heat of combustion assumes we are completely burning the
nutrient in an environment containing excess oxygen. The energy
value, however, can be less than expected and can be due to factors
such as the following:
• Cellulose can be combusted to release energy, but the human
body can’t metabolise or digest it.
16
• Nutrients move through the digestive system too fast for all of the
carbohydrates, fats and proteins to be absorbed.
These factors help us understand why sugars are excellent for quick energy, whereas
proteins are used for energy only when other sources are not readily available.
Table 2C–2 The composition of common foods
We also need to remember that foods
themselves are mixtures of these different
nutrients and as such offer us different energy
amounts in different ways. This is illustrated
with different examples in Table 2C–2. One
thing that you may notice about this table is
that the values don’t add up to 100%. This is
1.7 6.5 29
because there are other substances in the food
that don’t contribute to the energy content
(such as water and cellulose), which have been omitted.
We can then combine the information contained within Table 2C–1 and Table 2C–2 to
provide an estimation for the overall energy content of food. The process for doing this is

Significant figures
At the end of any calculation question in chemistry, you should check two things: units
and significant figures. It is frustrating to have done your working out correctly and
obtained the right value, only to lose marks because you haven’t included (or have used
the wrong) units or written your answer to the correct number of significant figures.
Depending on the assessment, you may lose marks every time you do this ... so these
mistakes can really add up!
In terms of significant figures, there are a few rules that you should know:
1 Any digit that isn’t a zero is significant (for example, 19.782 has five significant
figures).
2 Any zero that is found between two significant numbers is significant (for example,
19.702 has five significant figures).
3 After the decimal point, a zero that doesn’t come between two significant numbers
is only significant if it comes at the end (for example, 0.78200 has five significant
figures, whereas 0.00782 has three significant figures).
If you are multiplying or dividing, you consider all significant figures provided in the
question. For your answer, you will use the same number of significant figures as the
value in the question that contains the LEAST number of significant figures (not just
after the decimal point).
Let’s do an example.
Question: Multiply the following values: 54.7 and 0.02.
Answer: 1.094. However, our answer should use the smallest number of significant
figures in the question. Therefore, our actual answer is 1 (because 0.02 is only one
significant figure).
If you are adding or subtracting, the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in
the answer will be the same as the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in
the number with the fewest digits to the right of the decimal point.
Let’s look at the question above, but instead of multiplying the values, we will add them.
Question: Add the following values: 54.7 and 0.02.
Answer: 54.72. However, our answer should only include one digit to the right of the
decimal point, as this is the fewest provided in the question. Therefore, our actual
answer is 54.7.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can distinguish between random and systematic errors in calorimetry
CODE: 2B.9

WHAT (concept explanation):
Random errors cause unpredictable variations in measurements (like minor temperature fluctuations), while systematic errors cause consistent deviations in one direction (like heat loss through poor insulation).

WHY (importance):
Understanding error types guides experimental improvement strategies, as random errors are reduced by repeated trials while systematic errors require changes to equipment or procedure.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Consistently low temperature readings indicate systematic error from heat loss, while temperature readings varying randomly around the mean indicate random measurement error.

SUBTOPIC: Calorimetry Principles
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores experimental techniques for measuring heat energy changes in chemical reactions using calorimeters. It covers the specific heat capacity equation, calibration procedures using electrical and chemical methods, and analysis of temperature-time graphs to determine energy transformations.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Calorimetry provides experimental verification of theoretical energy values and allows measurement of heat released from fuels and foods. Understanding calibration and heat loss effects ensures accurate energy measurements, which are essential for fuel efficiency analysis and food energy labeling.

TOPIC: Measuring Changes in Chemical Reactions
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Quantitative analysis of combustion reactions including stoichiometric calculations for greenhouse gas emissions, calorimetry techniques for measuring energy release, and determination of energy content in fuels and foods.

Introduction
Energy is involved in almost every aspect of our lives. The food we eat for
breakfast, lunch and dinner provides our bodies with the energy that they need
to function. The petrol that we use to fill up our cars and motorbikes provides
the energy that they need to run. Electrical energy powers all our equipment
and devices, lights up our homes and helps us communicate all over the world.
In this chapter, we will focus on the energy that is generated from the chemical
reactions involving fuel and food. You will apply stoichiometry to a real-world
problem – the emission of greenhouse gases – and learn how to quantitate the energy
produced from combustion reactions.

ENGAGE
Lowering greenhouse gas emissions for global security
In 2015, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change held a summit in Paris that set down a landmark treaty
on greenhouse gas emissions targets that was supported by 196 member nations. In
November 2016, that treaty was ratified and became legally binding. The goal is to limit
global warming to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels and reach peak greenhouse
gas production as soon as possible.
In 2020, countries submitted their plans to reach their peak targets and the global
warming limit. While COP27, held in Egypt in 2022, revealed the political difficulties in
meeting the 1.5°C target, the 2015 Paris Agreement set the wheels in motion for many
countries to set low-carbon solutions, carbon economies and carbon neutrality targets,
all in the name of reaching this goal. This has led to new jobs, new industries and the
hope that by 2030 zero-carbon solutions could be viable options in sectors that currently
represent 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

EXPLAIN
Greenhouse gases and chemical reactions
Before beginning to explore chemical reactions in more depth, let’s first refresh our
understanding of how greenhouse gases are produced.
Combustion reactions
As you learned in Section 1C, combustion reactions occur when a hydrocarbon is burned
in the presence of oxygen. This results in the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
water vapour (H2O), which are greenhouse gases. Other well-known greenhouse gases
include nitrous oxide (N2O), ozone (O3) and methane (CH4). Methane is emitted during
the extraction and transport of natural gas, as well as from livestock and other agricultural
activities. These gases allow sunlight to pass through Earth’s atmosphere, but they trap the
heat that is reflected from the surface, preventing it from radiating out into space. This
process is known as the greenhouse effect, and it is what makes Earth warm enough to
support life as we know it.

Figure 2A–2 A representation of the natural greenhouse effect
However, an increase of these gases, particularly the ones caused by human activity,
such as CO2 and CH4, causes an enhancement of the greenhouse effect, known as the
enhanced greenhouse effect, which leads to global warming and climate change. Being able
to calculate how much greenhouse gas will be produced from a reaction is therefore critical
in determining the suitability of a reaction or process in line with the societal goals of
decreasing global warming.
When writing combustion reactions, it is also standard practice to state the enthalpy of the
given reaction.

2A MEASURING GREENHOUSE GASES

Common combustion reactions
There are several common reactions that produce different greenhouse gases. Carbon
dioxide (CO2) is produced when fossil fuels, such as coal, petrol and natural gas, are burned
for energy. For example, the combustion of octane in a car engine has the equation:
2C8H18(l) + 25O2(g) → 16CO2(g) + 18H2O(l) ΔH = –10 920 kJ mol–1
Not all combustion reactions go to completion. For example, carbon monoxide (CO)
is produced when fuels burn incompletely. For incomplete combustion reactions, the
enthalpy value can vary depending on the conditions. This is because ‘imperfect’ conditions,
such as a lack of oxygen or low temperatures, can lead to incomplete combustion.
Determining heat energy production from the combustion of fuels
Combustion is the chemical process that produces heat energy from the oxidation of fuels.
We can experience the benefits directly around an open fire or indirectly in powering
our homes and vehicles, where the energy from combusted fuels drives other processes.
Combustion reactions are always exothermic – that is, they release heat energy.
To determine the energy released from the combustion of some fuels, we can use the
reference tables found in the VCAA Data book for ‘Molar heat of combustion’, measured in
kJ mol–1, as shown below.

While heat energy transformation into other forms isn’t 100% efficient, a large portion
of this energy produced from combustion reactions can be put to use. Depending on the
amount of fuel available, which is expressed in moles, a certain amount of energy can be
released, as shown in Worked example 2A–1 on the following page.

a fuel sample
A 100.0 kg quantity of ethanol, C2H5OH, is burned in an industrial stove with an open
air-intake. How much energy, in MJ, will be produced if all the ethanol is burned?
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write down the information that you
have about the known substance.
Process
m(C2H5OH) = 100.0 kg = 100000 g

46.0 g mol–1

Step 3 Determine the energy produced by
multiplying n(C2H5OH) by the molar
heat of combustion of ethanol.

The amount of energy emitted or required for a reaction can vary considerably, as can
the amount of greenhouse gas produced. It is important to consider two things here:
• The energy value of the enthalpy is in kilojoules.
• The amounts are ‘per mole’ of reference material.
This last point should help us realise how important stoichiometry will be to success in
calculations of greenhouse gas emissions. To do this, we must first be able to successfully

Volume–volume stoichiometry
Volume–volume stoichiometry is similar to mass–mass stoichiometry and mass–volume
stoichiometry except we’re interested in the volume of a gaseous product from a given
volume of gaseous reactant or vice versa. If the following conditions are met, we can skip
some steps in the overall process.
1 The system is a closed system. A closed system is one in which energy can be transferred
between the reaction and the surroundings, but matter cannot. This is discussed further
in Section 5A.
2 The pressure is kept constant.
3 The temperature is kept constant.
If these conditions are met, then the ratio of gas volumes is identical to the mole ratios and
the coefficients in the reaction equation also apply for volume. For example, consider the

Identifying limiting reagents
In this section, you have learned more about calculations that require you to identify the limiting reagent
in combustion reactions. As described in the text, this involves calculating the number of moles of each
reactant and applying stoichiometric ratios to determine which is in excess and which is limiting.
When the stoichiometric ratio is 1 : 1, this is a relatively simple process whereby the reagent with the lowest
number of moles is limiting. However, it can become trickier when other stoichiometric ratios are involved.
To help with that, there are many tips and strategies that people employ to make sure they solve the
problem correctly. It is important that you find a method that makes sense and works well for you, but we
will describe one below that you may find useful. It can be summarised as follows.
Strategy: Once you have calculated the number of moles of each reactant, divide that value by the
stoichiometric coefficient from the equation. Whichever number is lower after you do this will correspond
to the limiting reagent.

To understand this better, let’s look at an example. In this instance, we won’t go through the process of
calculating the number of moles, we will just provide them in the question.
Question: The combustion of ethane can be represented by the following balanced equation:
2C2H6(g) + 7O2(g) → 4CO2(g) +6H2O(g)
If 0.5 moles of ethane reacts with 2.1 moles of oxygen, which is the limiting reagent?
Solution: Using the strategy that we have above, we can set out our calculation as follows.
C2H6 O2
Number of moles (n) 0.5 2.1
Stoichiometric coefficient 2 7
2.1
7 = 0.3
0.5
2 = 0.25 Therefore, C2H6 is the limiting reagent as it has the lowest value after dividing the number of moles by the
stoichiometric coefficient.
Go back over some practice questions that you have done involving a limiting reagent and use this method
to see if it helps.

Guinea pigs: nature’s calorimeter?
In 1789, Antione Lavoisier conducted a series of experiments
on guinea pigs. These are not the experiments for which he
was famed and which led to the discovery of the principle of
conservation of mass but, equally, they’re not far off. Lavoisier
was able to measure the heat of respiration by guinea pigs
and, in doing so, also invented the world’s first calorimeter,
a device for detecting the energy change in a chemical
reaction. He did this by placing the guinea pigs in a small ice
calorimeter (a container inside another container that’s filled
with ice) and measured how much ice was melted. He then
used this to determine the amount of energy produced by
the guinea pigs and their rate of respiration. Therefore, the
guinea pigs themselves were not the calorimeter, but they
were useful test subjects in determining the energy produced
when animals undergo respiration.

Measuring energy from fuels
In Section 1C and Section 2A, we discussed the release of energy from the combustion
reaction of fuels using thermochemical equations. However, what hasn’t yet been discussed
is how these energy values are calculated. To do this experimentally, it is useful to be able
to utilise a material known for its energy storage properties – water. Water is excellent for
measuring energy changes as it has a uniquely high specific heat capacity. We remember
from Unit 2 that the specific heat capacity of a material is the energy required to raise the
temperature of one gram of a given substance by one degree Celsius.

the temperature of water, but how does that help us determine the actual quantity of energy
released from the combustion of fuels? The answer lies in the use of the following formula,
which links together energy (q) with the specific heat capacity (c):
q = mcΔT
where:
q = The energy produced or used in joules
c = The specific heat capacity in J g–1°C–1
m = The mass of the substance in grams
ΔT = The change in temperature in degrees Celsius.

Calorimetry
an experimental
method by which
the heat energy
of food or a fuel
is measured
Calorimetry
To measure the quantity of energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction, we use a
technique called calorimetry. The analytical equipment used to perform calorimetry is the
calorimeter. All calorimeters have the same goals in their design:
• isolate the reaction taking place
• have well insulated walls
• have a reference material to reduce the effects of imperfect isolation
• use stirrers to ensure that temperatures measured are even
• use thermometers to measure the temperature in the calorimeter
• have negligible heat capacity (or a known accurate heat capacity), so the loss of heat in
heating the calorimeter can be taken into account.
One such technique, which can be used to measure the energy contained within food or
fuel, is known as simple calorimetry. The experimental set-up for simple calorimetry is
shown in Figure 2B–2.
Thermometer
Metal can
Water
Spirit burner
Fuel
Figure 2B–2 A simple calorimetry set-up like this can be used for measuring
the quantity of energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction.
In these experiments, the fuel or food is burned (or combusted) above a spirit burner that
is positioned beneath a container filled with water. As the fuel or food is burned, energy is
released. The energy that is released will gradually heat the water in the container. Using
the equation, q = mcΔT, above, the change in temperature can be used to calculate the
quantity of energy that is released from the fuel source.
The basic experimental procedure for this follows these steps:
1 Accurately measure and record the mass of water added to the metal can.
2 Record the initial temperature of the water.
3 Weigh your fuel source and place into the spirit burner.
4 Light the spirit burner.
5 Using the thermometer, record the change in temperature of the water over time.
6 Stop heating the water before all the fuel has been used and well before the water boils.
To help understand how this can be used to measure energy, let’s consider Worked
example 2B–2.

Solution calorimetry
Solution calorimeters measure the enthalpies associated with reactions that occur in
solution, including heat of precipitation, heat of solution and heat of neutralisation.
These reactions can be endothermic or exothermic. The container is thermally insulated,
preventing heat loss to the surroundings. Gas samples can be measured through solution
calorimetry using an ampoule. Ampoules are small (typically glass) sealed containers that
are used to preserve samples but can be broken open to release their sample safely.

Energy transformation efficiency
DOC
As the experimental set-up on page 54 suggests, the fuel in the spirit burner is undergoing
combustion and the heat energy produced is being used to heat the water. However,
this process is not 100% efficient. There are several reasons that can contribute to a
reduced efficiency, such as heat being lost to the surrounding environment or incomplete
combustion. By calculating the thermal energy absorbed by the water, as described in the
examples above and on page 55, and then comparing this to the known theoretical enthalpy
of combustion of the fuel being used, it is possible to calculate the energy transformation
efficiency. This is highlighted through Worked example 2B–4.

q = 100.0 g × 4.18 J g–1°C–1 × 37.2°C
q = 15549.6 J = 15.5 kJ
Step 3 Calculate the theoretical
maximum energy released by
the ethanol using the VCAA

m(C2H5OH) = 1.5 g
ΔH°c (C2H5OH) = 29.6 kJ g–1

Calibrating a calorimeter
To help reduce systematic errors, calibration of the apparatus is performed before each
experiment.
This can be done by either using a known chemical reference material such as a metal or a
well-studied compound like potassium chloride, or by using an electric heating element as a
known provider of energy based on the power supply.
Chemical calibration
Chemicals with well-characterised enthalpies of dissolution are often used as reference
materials for solution calorimetry. Potassium chloride is a common reference material, as it is
solid at room temperature and has a well-characterised enthalpy of dissolution of 17.2 kJ mol–1
.
For calibration to occur, a known amount of potassium chloride is placed
in the calorimeter and dissolved. The temperature change is recorded. We
then use two equations to determine the calibration factor:
E = n × ΔH
c
Calibration factor = E
ΔT
where:
E = The energy released in kilojoules
n = The number of moles of reference material
ΔHC = The heat of combustion for the reference material
ΔT = The change in temperature recorded.
Calibration factor may also be written as CF.

Calorimeters can also be calibrated electrically, as the heating element that heats the
solution has a constant power supply from the socket. This means that you can link
the energy produced by the element to a change in temperature of the water within the
calorimeter. The energy produced from electricity passing through the heating element is
calculated from the following equation:
E = V × I × t
where:
E = The energy produced in joules
V = The voltage in volts

If you know the calibration factor for a calorimeter, the results for energy changes you

Overall experimental process
Earlier in the chapter, we looked at calculating the energy produced from combustion reactions
using simple calorimeters and from other types of reactions using solution calorimetry.
However, as we’ve just seen, we also need to ensure the calorimeter is calibrated before making
the measurement. This means our overall process for performing a calorimetric measurement
to determine the enthalpy change of a reaction should be as follows:
1 Calibrate your calorimeter using the most appropriate method.
2 Perform your experiment.
3 Interpret your data.
4 Perform your calculations to determine the calibration factor, CF.
5 Use the calibration factor to determine ΔH.

2B SKILLS
Random versus systematic errors
In the context of chemistry, particularly in an experiment such as calorimetry, two types
of errors commonly occur: random and systematic.
Random errors occur unpredictably and differ in each measurement. They’re caused
by unpredictable fluctuations in the experimental process, such as variations in
temperature, slight inconsistencies in material, or even human error during observation.
In a calorimetry experiment, a random error could be the minor fluctuation in the
temperature readings of the calorimeter. While these errors can’t be completely
eliminated, they can be minimised by conducting multiple trials and calculating an
average result.
On the other hand, systematic errors are predictable and consistent in each
measurement. They’re caused by faulty equipment, incorrect calibration or bias in
the method of measurement. For instance, if the calorimeter isn’t perfectly insulated,
heat may escape or enter, leading to a consistent underestimation or overestimation of
energy changes in the system, respectively. This is a systematic error. Systematic errors
can be identified because they skew results in a particular direction and their effect
remains consistent irrespective of the number of trials. To eliminate systematic errors,
equipment should be properly calibrated, and methods should be evaluated and adjusted
if necessary.
The difference between these two types of errors can be demonstrated visually, as shown
below.
Systematic error
Actual value
Random error
Therefore, while both random and systematic errors affect the accuracy of experimental
results, they have different sources and strategies for minimisation or elimination. The
identification and understanding of these errors are key to improving the reliability and
validity of experimental outcomes.
We can also look at these through a question, in which you might be asked to identify
the type of error that has occurred.
Question: During a calorimetry experiment to determine the energy released from the
combustion of a fuel, the recorded temperature change is consistently lower than the
expected value. Is this error likely to be random or systematic? Provide some potential
sources of the error.

Answer: The consistently lower temperature change observed in the calorimetry
experiment suggests that the error is likely to be systematic rather than random.
Systematic errors are characterised by consistent deviations in the same direction and
magnitude. In this case, the lower recorded temperature change indicates a systematic bias
that may be attributed to a flaw in the experimental set-up or procedure. It is important
to carefully examine factors such as insulation, calorimeter calibration, heat loss and
combustion efficiency to identify and rectify the source of this systematic error. By
addressing the underlying issue causing the consistent deviation, scientists can improve
the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained from the calorimetry experiment.

with the energy content information of the product. This allows us to make informed
choices about the nutritional value of food, as well as the way the energy in food is being
provided. This is because different food types provide energy differently, depending on
the make-up of proteins, fats and carbohydrates within the food.
Figure 2C–1 A medium cheeseburger meal (left) provides 3515 kJ of energy, whereas a regular
Acai bowl (right) provides 1760 kJ.
EXPLAIN
Food: a biochemical energy source
While we often think of food in terms of taste, our body views food as energy. When
digested, the main food groups are broken down into smaller molecules that can be
used directly as a source of energy or stored for later use. While we do also use food for
structural components associated with growth, repair and daily function, food still comes
down to the balance between energy taken in and energy used in the activities of daily life.
The main nutrients are carbohydrates, fats and proteins. As all of these groups are
comprised of a mixture of different substances (for example, proteins refers to a number
of different proteins, not a ‘pure’ protein), we measure energy value in food in kJ g–1, not
kJ mol–1 as we did with energy from reactions in the previous section. Equally, just because
a nutrient has a certain energy content doesn’t mean that the energy can be fully extracted
from that food. This is shown in Table 2C–1.

Table 2C–1 The heat of combustion of
different food groups
Nutrient Heat of
combustion (kJ g–1)
Fats and oils 37
Proteins 17
Carbohydrates The heat of combustion assumes we are completely burning the
nutrient in an environment containing excess oxygen. The energy
value, however, can be less than expected and can be due to factors
such as the following:
• Cellulose can be combusted to release energy, but the human
body can’t metabolise or digest it.
16
• Nutrients move through the digestive system too fast for all of the
carbohydrates, fats and proteins to be absorbed.
These factors help us understand why sugars are excellent for quick energy, whereas
proteins are used for energy only when other sources are not readily available.
Table 2C–2 The composition of common foods
We also need to remember that foods
themselves are mixtures of these different
nutrients and as such offer us different energy
amounts in different ways. This is illustrated
with different examples in Table 2C–2. One
thing that you may notice about this table is
that the values don’t add up to 100%. This is
1.7 6.5 29
because there are other substances in the food
that don’t contribute to the energy content
(such as water and cellulose), which have been omitted.
We can then combine the information contained within Table 2C–1 and Table 2C–2 to
provide an estimation for the overall energy content of food. The process for doing this is
explained in Worked example 2C–1.
Food % Protein % Fats/Oils % Carbohydrates

EXAMPLE 2C–1
Worked example 2C–1: Calculating the overall energy content of food
The nutritional information on a bag of unsalted almonds states that they consist of
21.0% water, 21.0% carbohydrates, 6.0% protein and 52.0% fat. Given that water provides
no energy, determine the energy value of a 100 g bag of unsalted almonds, in kJ g–1
.
Solution
Logic Refer to tables to determine the
available energy for the nutrients
in the nuts.
Process
Fats = 37 kJ g–1
Proteins = 17 kJ g–1
Carbohydrates = 16 kJ g–1
Step 1 Step 2 Convert the percentages to
a mass assuming 100 g is
equivalent to 100% and multiply
by energy availability.
Fats = 37 kJ g–1 × 52.0 g
= 1924 kJ
Proteins = 17 kJ g–1 × 6.0 g
= 102 kJ
Carbohydrates = 16 kJ g–1 × 21.0 g
= 336 kJ
Step 3 Add all available energy. Total energy = 1924 kJ + 102 kJ + 336 kJ
= 2362 kJ
Step 4 Divide by the mass of the
sample to get units of energy
value, kJ g–1
.
Energy value = 2383 kJ
100 g
= 23.62 kJ g–1

no energy, determine the energy value of a 100 g bag of chips, in kJ g–1
.
Food and calorimetry
Just like fuels, the energy contained within food can be determined by calorimetry. From
these measurements we can arrive at an overall estimate for the energy content of food.

VIDEO
WORKED
EXAMPLE 2C–2
A potato chip weighing 0.150 g was partially burned under a metal can containing 150 g
of water. By the end of the experiment, the temperature of the water had increased by
22.5°C, and the remaining mass of the potato chip was 0.030 g. Calculate the energy
value of the potato chip in kJ g–1
.
Solution
Step 1 Logic Calculate the heat transferred to the
water from the burning potato chip
using q = mcΔT.
Process
q = mcΔT
q = 150 g × 4.18 Jg–1°C–1 × 22.5°C
= 14107.5 J
Step 2 Convert the energy into kilojoules. 14107.5 J = 14.11 kJ
Step 3 Calculate the mass of food burned. Total mass burned = minitial – mfinal
= 0.15 g – 0.03 g
= 0.12 g
Step 4 Calculate the energy value by
dividing the energy calculated in
step 2 by the mass from step 3.
Energy value = 14.11
0.12
= 120 kJ g–1

2C SKILLS
Significant figures
At the end of any calculation question in chemistry, you should check two things: units
and significant figures. It is frustrating to have done your working out correctly and
obtained the right value, only to lose marks because you haven’t included (or have used
the wrong) units or written your answer to the correct number of significant figures.
Depending on the assessment, you may lose marks every time you do this ... so these
mistakes can really add up!
In terms of significant figures, there are a few rules that you should know:
1 Any digit that isn’t a zero is significant (for example, 19.782 has five significant
figures).
2 Any zero that is found between two significant numbers is significant (for example,
19.702 has five significant figures).
3 After the decimal point, a zero that doesn’t come between two significant numbers
is only significant if it comes at the end (for example, 0.78200 has five significant
figures, whereas 0.00782 has three significant figures).
If you are multiplying or dividing, you consider all significant figures provided in the
question. For your answer, you will use the same number of significant figures as the
value in the question that contains the LEAST number of significant figures (not just
after the decimal point).
Let’s do an example.
Question: Multiply the following values: 54.7 and 0.02.
Answer: 1.094. However, our answer should use the smallest number of significant
figures in the question. Therefore, our actual answer is 1 (because 0.02 is only one
significant figure).
If you are adding or subtracting, the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in
the answer will be the same as the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in
the number with the fewest digits to the right of the decimal point.
Let’s look at the question above, but instead of multiplying the values, we will add them.
Question: Add the following values: 54.7 and 0.02.
Answer: 54.72. However, our answer should only include one digit to the right of the
decimal point, as this is the fewest provided in the question. Therefore, our actual
answer is 54.7.

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can distinguish between random and systematic errors in calorimetry
CODE: 2B.9

WHAT (concept explanation):
Random errors cause unpredictable variations in measurements (like minor temperature fluctuations), while systematic errors cause consistent deviations in one direction (like heat loss through poor insulation).

WHY (importance):
Understanding error types guides experimental improvement strategies, as random errors are reduced by repeated trials while systematic errors require changes to equipment or procedure.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Consistently low temperature readings indicate systematic error from heat loss, while temperature readings varying randomly around the mean indicate random measurement error.

SUBTOPIC: Calorimetry Principles
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores experimental techniques for measuring heat energy changes in chemical reactions using calorimeters. It covers the specific heat capacity equation, calibration procedures using electrical and chemical methods, and analysis of temperature-time graphs to determine energy transformations.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Calorimetry provides experimental verification of theoretical energy values and allows measurement of heat released from fuels and foods. Understanding calibration and heat loss effects ensures accurate energy measurements, which are essential for fuel efficiency analysis and food energy labeling.

TOPIC: Measuring Changes in Chemical Reactions
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Quantitative analysis of combustion reactions including stoichiometric calculations for greenhouse gas emissions, calorimetry techniques for measuring energy release, and determination of energy content in fuels and foods.

MEASURING CHANGES IN
CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Introduction
Energy is involved in almost every aspect of our lives. The food we eat for
breakfast, lunch and dinner provides our bodies with the energy that they need
to function. The petrol that we use to fill up our cars and motorbikes provides
the energy that they need to run. Electrical energy powers all our equipment
and devices, lights up our homes and helps us communicate all over the world.
In this chapter, we will focus on the energy that is generated from the chemical
reactions involving fuel and food. You will apply stoichiometry to a real-world
problem – the emission of greenhouse gases – and learn how to quantitate the energy
produced from combustion reactions.

ENGAGE
Lowering greenhouse gas emissions for global security
In 2015, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change held a summit in Paris that set down a landmark treaty
on greenhouse gas emissions targets that was supported by 196 member nations. In
November 2016, that treaty was ratified and became legally binding. The goal is to limit
global warming to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels and reach peak greenhouse
gas production as soon as possible.
In 2020, countries submitted their plans to reach their peak targets and the global
warming limit. While COP27, held in Egypt in 2022, revealed the political difficulties in
meeting the 1.5°C target, the 2015 Paris Agreement set the wheels in motion for many
countries to set low-carbon solutions, carbon economies and carbon neutrality targets,
all in the name of reaching this goal. This has led to new jobs, new industries and the
hope that by 2030 zero-carbon solutions could be viable options in sectors that currently
represent 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

EXPLAIN
Greenhouse gases and chemical reactions
Before beginning to explore chemical reactions in more depth, let’s first refresh our
understanding of how greenhouse gases are produced.
Combustion reactions
As you learned in Section 1C, combustion reactions occur when a hydrocarbon is burned
in the presence of oxygen. This results in the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
water vapour (H2O), which are greenhouse gases. Other well-known greenhouse gases
include nitrous oxide (N2O), ozone (O3) and methane (CH4). Methane is emitted during
the extraction and transport of natural gas, as well as from livestock and other agricultural
activities. These gases allow sunlight to pass through Earth’s atmosphere, but they trap the
heat that is reflected from the surface, preventing it from radiating out into space. This
process is known as the greenhouse effect, and it is what makes Earth warm enough to
support life as we know it.

Figure 2A–2 A representation of the natural greenhouse effect
However, an increase of these gases, particularly the ones caused by human activity,
such as CO2 and CH4, causes an enhancement of the greenhouse effect, known as the
enhanced greenhouse effect, which leads to global warming and climate change. Being able
to calculate how much greenhouse gas will be produced from a reaction is therefore critical
in determining the suitability of a reaction or process in line with the societal goals of
decreasing global warming.
When writing combustion reactions, it is also standard practice to state the enthalpy of the
given reaction.

Common combustion reactions
There are several common reactions that produce different greenhouse gases. Carbon
dioxide (CO2) is produced when fossil fuels, such as coal, petrol and natural gas, are burned
for energy. For example, the combustion of octane in a car engine has the equation:
2C8H18(l) + 25O2(g) → 16CO2(g) + 18H2O(l) ΔH = –10 920 kJ mol–1
Not all combustion reactions go to completion. For example, carbon monoxide (CO)
is produced when fuels burn incompletely. For incomplete combustion reactions, the
enthalpy value can vary depending on the conditions. This is because ‘imperfect’ conditions,
such as a lack of oxygen or low temperatures, can lead to incomplete combustion.
Determining heat energy production from the combustion of fuels
Combustion is the chemical process that produces heat energy from the oxidation of fuels.
We can experience the benefits directly around an open fire or indirectly in powering
our homes and vehicles, where the energy from combusted fuels drives other processes.
Combustion reactions are always exothermic – that is, they release heat energy.
To determine the energy released from the combustion of some fuels, we can use the
reference tables found in the VCAA Data book for ‘Molar heat of combustion’, measured in
kJ mol–1, as shown below.

While heat energy transformation into other forms isn’t 100% efficient, a large portion
of this energy produced from combustion reactions can be put to use. Depending on the
amount of fuel available, which is expressed in moles, a certain amount of energy can be
released, as shown in Worked example 2A–1 on the following page.

a fuel sample
A 100.0 kg quantity of ethanol, C2H5OH, is burned in an industrial stove with an open
air-intake. How much energy, in MJ, will be produced if all the ethanol is burned?
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write down the information that you
have about the known substance.
Process
m(C2H5OH) = 100.0 kg = 100000 g
M(C2H5OH) = 46.0 gmol–1

n(C2H5OH) =

46.0 g mol–1
= 2173.9 mol
Step 3 Determine the energy produced by
multiplying n(C2H5OH) by the molar
heat of combustion of ethanol.
E = 1360 kJmol–1 × 2173.9 mol

Special conditions of stoichiometry
The amount of energy emitted or required for a reaction can vary considerably, as can
the amount of greenhouse gas produced. It is important to consider two things here:
• The energy value of the enthalpy is in kilojoules.
• The amounts are ‘per mole’ of reference material.
This last point should help us realise how important stoichiometry will be to success in
calculations of greenhouse gas emissions. To do this, we must first be able to successfully
calculations of greenhouse gas emissions. To do this, we must first be able to successfully
balance an equation.

Converting stoichiometrically from different units
In addition to basic calculations, there are times when we don’t need to convert to/from
the amount in moles, n, and we can convert stoichiometrically from different units. This is

5 times the amount of CO2 is produced per

Mass–mass stoichiometry
For mass–mass stoichiometry, we’re interested in the mass of product produced from a
given mass of reactant or vice versa. To calculate this successfully, we need to determine
the number of moles of the substance we have information for and then follow our ‘down,
across, up’ process, as shown in Figure 2A–3.

using m = n × M.

mass–mass questions. We see this in action in Worked example 2A–4.

From the equations, the number before
propane is 1 and CO2 is 3.
n(C3H8) : n(CO2) = 1 : 3
Step 5 Use the ratio to determine the
unknown number of moles.
n(CO2) = 3 × n(C3H8)

Mass–volume stoichiometry is similar to mass–mass stoichiometry except we are interested in
the volume of product produced from a given mass of reactant or vice versa. To calculate this

Volume–volume stoichiometry
Volume–volume stoichiometry is similar to mass–mass stoichiometry and mass–volume
stoichiometry except we’re interested in the volume of a gaseous product from a given
volume of gaseous reactant or vice versa. If the following conditions are met, we can skip
some steps in the overall process.
1 The system is a closed system. A closed system is one in which energy can be transferred
between the reaction and the surroundings, but matter cannot. This is discussed further
in Section 5A.
2 The pressure is kept constant.
3 The temperature is kept constant.
If these conditions are met, then the ratio of gas volumes is identical to the mole ratios and
the coefficients in the reaction equation also apply for volume. For example, consider the
following equation:

2A SKILLS
Identifying limiting reagents
In this section, you have learned more about calculations that require you to identify the limiting reagent
in combustion reactions. As described in the text, this involves calculating the number of moles of each
reactant and applying stoichiometric ratios to determine which is in excess and which is limiting.
When the stoichiometric ratio is 1 : 1, this is a relatively simple process whereby the reagent with the lowest
number of moles is limiting. However, it can become trickier when other stoichiometric ratios are involved.
To help with that, there are many tips and strategies that people employ to make sure they solve the
problem correctly. It is important that you find a method that makes sense and works well for you, but we
will describe one below that you may find useful. It can be summarised as follows.
Strategy: Once you have calculated the number of moles of each reactant, divide that value by the
stoichiometric coefficient from the equation. Whichever number is lower after you do this will correspond
to the limiting reagent.

To understand this better, let’s look at an example. In this instance, we won’t go through the process of
calculating the number of moles, we will just provide them in the question.
Question: The combustion of ethane can be represented by the following balanced equation:
2C2H6(g) + 7O2(g) → 4CO2(g) +6H2O(g)
If 0.5 moles of ethane reacts with 2.1 moles of oxygen, which is the limiting reagent?
Solution: Using the strategy that we have above, we can set out our calculation as follows.
C2H6 O2
Number of moles (n) 0.5 2.1
Stoichiometric coefficient 2 7
2.1
7 = 0.3
0.5
2 = 0.25 Therefore, C2H6 is the limiting reagent as it has the lowest value after dividing the number of moles by the
stoichiometric coefficient.
Go back over some practice questions that you have done involving a limiting reagent and use this method
to see if it helps.

Guinea pigs: nature’s calorimeter?
In 1789, Antione Lavoisier conducted a series of experiments
on guinea pigs. These are not the experiments for which he
was famed and which led to the discovery of the principle of
conservation of mass but, equally, they’re not far off. Lavoisier
was able to measure the heat of respiration by guinea pigs
and, in doing so, also invented the world’s first calorimeter,
a device for detecting the energy change in a chemical
reaction. He did this by placing the guinea pigs in a small ice
calorimeter (a container inside another container that’s filled
with ice) and measured how much ice was melted. He then
used this to determine the amount of energy produced by
the guinea pigs and their rate of respiration. Therefore, the
guinea pigs themselves were not the calorimeter, but they
were useful test subjects in determining the energy produced
when animals undergo respiration.

Measuring energy from fuels
In Section 1C and Section 2A, we discussed the release of energy from the combustion
reaction of fuels using thermochemical equations. However, what hasn’t yet been discussed
is how these energy values are calculated. To do this experimentally, it is useful to be able
to utilise a material known for its energy storage properties – water. Water is excellent for
measuring energy changes as it has a uniquely high specific heat capacity. We remember
from Unit 2 that the specific heat capacity of a material is the energy required to raise the
temperature of one gram of a given substance by one degree Celsius.

As Table 2B–1 shows, liquid water stands out in its ability to store energy with little change
in temperature.
From this, we can understand that a relatively large quantity of energy is required to raise
the temperature of water, but how does that help us determine the actual quantity of energy
released from the combustion of fuels? The answer lies in the use of the following formula,
which links together energy (q) with the specific heat capacity (c):
q = mcΔT
where:
q = The energy produced or used in joules
c = The specific heat capacity in J g–1°C–1

Calorimetry
an experimental
method by which
the heat energy
of food or a fuel
is measured
Calorimetry
To measure the quantity of energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction, we use a
technique called calorimetry. The analytical equipment used to perform calorimetry is the
calorimeter. All calorimeters have the same goals in their design:
• isolate the reaction taking place
• have well insulated walls
• have a reference material to reduce the effects of imperfect isolation
• use stirrers to ensure that temperatures measured are even
• use thermometers to measure the temperature in the calorimeter
• have negligible heat capacity (or a known accurate heat capacity), so the loss of heat in
heating the calorimeter can be taken into account.
One such technique, which can be used to measure the energy contained within food or
fuel, is known as simple calorimetry. The experimental set-up for simple calorimetry is
shown in Figure 2B–2.
Thermometer
Metal can
Water
Spirit burner
Fuel
Figure 2B–2 A simple calorimetry set-up like this can be used for measuring
the quantity of energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction.
In these experiments, the fuel or food is burned (or combusted) above a spirit burner that
is positioned beneath a container filled with water. As the fuel or food is burned, energy is
released. The energy that is released will gradually heat the water in the container. Using
the equation, q = mcΔT, above, the change in temperature can be used to calculate the
quantity of energy that is released from the fuel source.
The basic experimental procedure for this follows these steps:
1 Accurately measure and record the mass of water added to the metal can.
2 Record the initial temperature of the water.
3 Weigh your fuel source and place into the spirit burner.
4 Light the spirit burner.
5 Using the thermometer, record the change in temperature of the water over time.
6 Stop heating the water before all the fuel has been used and well before the water boils.
To help understand how this can be used to measure energy, let’s consider Worked
example 2B–2.

Solution calorimetry
Solution calorimeters measure the enthalpies associated with reactions that occur in
solution, including heat of precipitation, heat of solution and heat of neutralisation.
These reactions can be endothermic or exothermic. The container is thermally insulated,
preventing heat loss to the surroundings. Gas samples can be measured through solution
calorimetry using an ampoule. Ampoules are small (typically glass) sealed containers that
are used to preserve samples but can be broken open to release their sample safely.

Energy transformation efficiency
DOC
As the experimental set-up on page 54 suggests, the fuel in the spirit burner is undergoing
combustion and the heat energy produced is being used to heat the water. However,
this process is not 100% efficient. There are several reasons that can contribute to a
reduced efficiency, such as heat being lost to the surrounding environment or incomplete
combustion. By calculating the thermal energy absorbed by the water, as described in the
examples above and on page 55, and then comparing this to the known theoretical enthalpy
of combustion of the fuel being used, it is possible to calculate the energy transformation
efficiency. This is highlighted through Worked example 2B–4.

q = mcΔT
q = 100.0 g × 4.18 J g–1°C–1 × 37.2°C
q = 15549.6 J = 15.5 kJ
Step 3 Calculate the theoretical

the ethanol using the VCAA

m(C2H5OH) = 1.5 g
ΔH°c (C2H5OH) = 29.6 kJ g–1

Calibrating a calorimeter
To help reduce systematic errors, calibration of the apparatus is performed before each
experiment.
This can be done by either using a known chemical reference material such as a metal or a
well-studied compound like potassium chloride, or by using an electric heating element as a
known provider of energy based on the power supply.
Chemical calibration
Chemicals with well-characterised enthalpies of dissolution are often used as reference
materials for solution calorimetry. Potassium chloride is a common reference material, as it is
solid at room temperature and has a well-characterised enthalpy of dissolution of 17.2 kJ mol–1
.
For calibration to occur, a known amount of potassium chloride is placed
in the calorimeter and dissolved. The temperature change is recorded. We
then use two equations to determine the calibration factor:
E = n × ΔH
c
Calibration factor = E
ΔT
where:
E = The energy released in kilojoules
n = The number of moles of reference material
ΔHC = The heat of combustion for the reference material
ΔT = The change in temperature recorded.
Calibration factor may also be written as CF.

Calorimeters can also be calibrated electrically, as the heating element that heats the
solution has a constant power supply from the socket. This means that you can link
the energy produced by the element to a change in temperature of the water within the
calorimeter. The energy produced from electricity passing through the heating element is
calculated from the following equation:
E = V × I × t
where:
E = The energy produced in joules
V = The voltage in volts
I = The current in amperes
t = The time in seconds.

If you know the calibration factor for a calorimeter, the results for energy changes you
produce will be more accurate. This allows us to put together a complete procedure for
using a calorimeter and getting the best possible results with minimal experimental error.
Overall experimental process
Earlier in the chapter, we looked at calculating the energy produced from combustion reactions
using simple calorimeters and from other types of reactions using solution calorimetry.
However, as we’ve just seen, we also need to ensure the calorimeter is calibrated before making
the measurement. This means our overall process for performing a calorimetric measurement
to determine the enthalpy change of a reaction should be as follows:
1 Calibrate your calorimeter using the most appropriate method.
2 Perform your experiment.
3 Interpret your data.
4 Perform your calculations to determine the calibration factor, CF.
5 Use the calibration factor to determine ΔH.

Random versus systematic errors
In the context of chemistry, particularly in an experiment such as calorimetry, two types
of errors commonly occur: random and systematic.
Random errors occur unpredictably and differ in each measurement. They’re caused
by unpredictable fluctuations in the experimental process, such as variations in
temperature, slight inconsistencies in material, or even human error during observation.
In a calorimetry experiment, a random error could be the minor fluctuation in the
temperature readings of the calorimeter. While these errors can’t be completely
eliminated, they can be minimised by conducting multiple trials and calculating an
average result.
On the other hand, systematic errors are predictable and consistent in each
measurement. They’re caused by faulty equipment, incorrect calibration or bias in
the method of measurement. For instance, if the calorimeter isn’t perfectly insulated,
heat may escape or enter, leading to a consistent underestimation or overestimation of
energy changes in the system, respectively. This is a systematic error. Systematic errors
can be identified because they skew results in a particular direction and their effect
remains consistent irrespective of the number of trials. To eliminate systematic errors,
equipment should be properly calibrated, and methods should be evaluated and adjusted
if necessary.
The difference between these two types of errors can be demonstrated visually, as shown
below.
Systematic error
Actual value
Random error
Therefore, while both random and systematic errors affect the accuracy of experimental
results, they have different sources and strategies for minimisation or elimination. The
identification and understanding of these errors are key to improving the reliability and
validity of experimental outcomes.
We can also look at these through a question, in which you might be asked to identify
the type of error that has occurred.
Question: During a calorimetry experiment to determine the energy released from the
combustion of a fuel, the recorded temperature change is consistently lower than the
expected value. Is this error likely to be random or systematic? Provide some potential
sources of the error.

Answer: The consistently lower temperature change observed in the calorimetry
experiment suggests that the error is likely to be systematic rather than random.
Systematic errors are characterised by consistent deviations in the same direction and
magnitude. In this case, the lower recorded temperature change indicates a systematic bias
that may be attributed to a flaw in the experimental set-up or procedure. It is important
to carefully examine factors such as insulation, calorimeter calibration, heat loss and
combustion efficiency to identify and rectify the source of this systematic error. By
addressing the underlying issue causing the consistent deviation, scientists can improve
the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained from the calorimetry experiment.

Measuring energy from food
2C
Study Design:
• energy from fuels and food:
• calculation of energy transformation efficiency during combustion as a
percentage of chemical energy converted to useful energy
• comparison and calculations of energy values of foods containing carbohydrates,
proteins and fats and oils
ENGAGE
Energy: It’s all in a label
When we think of food packaging, we usually think of brands, logos and advertisements.
However, did you know that food packaging has a major legal responsibility to provide
consumers with the information available to them around the energy provided in
a food? Not only do labels provide us with a list of ingredients, they also provide us
with the energy content information of the product. This allows us to make informed
choices about the nutritional value of food, as well as the way the energy in food is being
provided. This is because different food types provide energy differently, depending on
the make-up of proteins, fats and carbohydrates within the food.
Figure 2C–1 A medium cheeseburger meal (left) provides 3515 kJ of energy, whereas a regular
Acai bowl (right) provides 1760 kJ.
EXPLAIN
Food: a biochemical energy source
While we often think of food in terms of taste, our body views food as energy. When
digested, the main food groups are broken down into smaller molecules that can be
used directly as a source of energy or stored for later use. While we do also use food for
structural components associated with growth, repair and daily function, food still comes
down to the balance between energy taken in and energy used in the activities of daily life.
The main nutrients are carbohydrates, fats and proteins. As all of these groups are
comprised of a mixture of different substances (for example, proteins refers to a number
of different proteins, not a ‘pure’ protein), we measure energy value in food in kJ g–1, not
kJ mol–1 as we did with energy from reactions in the previous section. Equally, just because
a nutrient has a certain energy content doesn’t mean that the energy can be fully extracted
from that food. This is shown in Table 2C–1.

different food groups
Nutrient Heat of
combustion (kJ g–1)
Fats and oils 37
Proteins 17
Carbohydrates The heat of combustion assumes we are completely burning the
nutrient in an environment containing excess oxygen. The energy
value, however, can be less than expected and can be due to factors
such as the following:
• Cellulose can be combusted to release energy, but the human
body can’t metabolise or digest it.
16
• Nutrients move through the digestive system too fast for all of the
carbohydrates, fats and proteins to be absorbed.
These factors help us understand why sugars are excellent for quick energy, whereas
proteins are used for energy only when other sources are not readily available.
Table 2C–2 The composition of common foods
We also need to remember that foods
themselves are mixtures of these different
nutrients and as such offer us different energy
amounts in different ways. This is illustrated
with different examples in Table 2C–2. One
thing that you may notice about this table is
that the values don’t add up to 100%. This is
1.7 6.5 29
because there are other substances in the food
that don’t contribute to the energy content
(such as water and cellulose), which have been omitted.
We can then combine the information contained within Table 2C–1 and Table 2C–2 to
provide an estimation for the overall energy content of food. The process for doing this is
explained in Worked example 2C–1.

no energy, determine the energy value of a 100 g bag of unsalted almonds, in kJ g–1
.
Solution
Logic Refer to tables to determine the
available energy for the nutrients
in the nuts.
Process
Fats = 37 kJ g–1
Proteins = 17 kJ g–1
Carbohydrates = 16 kJ g–1
Step 1 Step 2 Convert the percentages to
a mass assuming 100 g is
equivalent to 100% and multiply
by energy availability.
Fats = 37 kJ g–1 × 52.0 g
= 1924 kJ
Proteins = 17 kJ g–1 × 6.0 g
= 102 kJ
Carbohydrates = 16 kJ g–1 × 21.0 g
= 336 kJ
Step 3 Add all available energy. Total energy = 1924 kJ + 102 kJ + 336 kJ
= 2362 kJ
Step 4 Divide by the mass of the
sample to get units of energy
value, kJ g–1
.
Energy value = 2383 kJ

EXAMPLE 2C–2
A potato chip weighing 0.150 g was partially burned under a metal can containing 150 g
of water. By the end of the experiment, the temperature of the water had increased by
22.5°C, and the remaining mass of the potato chip was 0.030 g. Calculate the energy
value of the potato chip in kJ g–1
.
Solution
Step 1 Logic Calculate the heat transferred to the
water from the burning potato chip
using q = mcΔT.
Process
q = mcΔT
q = 150 g × 4.18 Jg–1°C–1 × 22.5°C
= 14107.5 J
Step 2 Convert the energy into kilojoules. 14107.5 J = 14.11 kJ
Step 3 Calculate the mass of food burned. Total mass burned = minitial – mfinal
= 0.15 g – 0.03 g
= 0.12 g
Step 4 Calculate the energy value by
dividing the energy calculated in
step 2 by the mass from step 3.

Significant figures
At the end of any calculation question in chemistry, you should check two things: units
and significant figures. It is frustrating to have done your working out correctly and
obtained the right value, only to lose marks because you haven’t included (or have used
the wrong) units or written your answer to the correct number of significant figures.
Depending on the assessment, you may lose marks every time you do this ... so these
mistakes can really add up!
In terms of significant figures, there are a few rules that you should know:
1 Any digit that isn’t a zero is significant (for example, 19.782 has five significant
figures).
2 Any zero that is found between two significant numbers is significant (for example,
19.702 has five significant figures).
3 After the decimal point, a zero that doesn’t come between two significant numbers
is only significant if it comes at the end (for example, 0.78200 has five significant
figures, whereas 0.00782 has three significant figures).
If you are multiplying or dividing, you consider all significant figures provided in the
question. For your answer, you will use the same number of significant figures as the
value in the question that contains the LEAST number of significant figures (not just
after the decimal point).
Let’s do an example.
Question: Multiply the following values: 54.7 and 0.02.
Answer: 1.094. However, our answer should use the smallest number of significant
figures in the question. Therefore, our actual answer is 1 (because 0.02 is only one
significant figure).
If you are adding or subtracting, the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in
the answer will be the same as the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in
the number with the fewest digits to the right of the decimal point.
Let’s look at the question above, but instead of multiplying the values, we will add them.
Question: Add the following values: 54.7 and 0.02.
Answer: 54.72. However, our answer should only include one digit to the right of the
decimal point, as this is the fewest provided in the question. Therefore, our actual
answer is 54.7.

GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Exactly 10 questions total matching the specified mix (8 MC, 2 Cloze, 0 TF)
- LENGTH PARITY: All MC options must be similar length. Do NOT make correct answer longer than distractors. Keep correct answers pithy OR extend all distractors to match.
- All distractors must be real misconceptions, never absurd
- Verify factual accuracy—do not hallucinate
- One unambiguous correct answer per question
- Include the _link block exactly as shown with actual values
- Output raw JSON only
