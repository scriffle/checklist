      "title": "I can define specific heat capacity and use appropriate units",
      "code": "2B.1",
      "what": "Specific heat capacity (c) is the energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius, measured in J g⁻¹ °C⁻¹. Water has a high specific heat capacity of 4.18 J g⁻¹ °C⁻¹.",
      "why": "This property explains why water is ideal for calorimetry experiments, as it can absorb large amounts of heat with relatively small temperature changes, making measurements more accurate.",
      "example": "Water requires 4.18 J to raise 1 g by 1°C, while copper requires only 0.38 J g⁻¹ °C⁻¹, making water more effective for measuring heat energy in calorimeters.",

      "title": "I can explain why water is used as the reference material in calorimetry",
      "code": "2B.2",
      "what": "Water is used in calorimetry due to its uniquely high specific heat capacity, availability, safety, and well-documented thermal properties. These characteristics make it an excellent medium for absorbing and measuring heat energy changes.",
      "why": "Understanding water's thermal properties justifies its use in calorimetry and explains why experimental procedures rely on water temperature changes to measure energy release from combustion.",
      "example": "Liquid water stores more than 4 times as much energy per gram per degree than granite (0.79 J g⁻¹ °C⁻¹), making it superior for detecting heat changes.",

      "code": "2B.3",
      "what": "The equation q = mcΔT calculates heat energy (q in joules) where m is mass in grams, c is specific heat capacity in J g⁻¹ °C⁻¹, and ΔT is temperature change in degrees Celsius.",
      "why": "This fundamental equation converts measurable temperature changes into quantifiable energy values, enabling determination of heat released or absorbed in chemical reactions.",
      "example": "Heating 100 g of water by 10°C requires q = 100 × 4.18 × 10 = 4180 J of energy, which equals the heat released by the fuel or reaction.",

      "code": "2B.4",
      "what": "Solution calorimeters measure heat changes in reactions occurring in solution using thermally insulated containers, stirrers for uniform temperature, thermometers, and sealed lids to minimize heat loss to surroundings.",
      "why": "These design features ensure accurate heat measurements by isolating the reaction system, preventing heat loss, and maintaining even temperature distribution throughout the solution.",
      "example": "A coffee cup calorimeter with insulated walls and sealed lid measures heat of neutralization when 0.1 M HCl reacts with 0.1 M NaOH, recording temperature increase from mixing.",

      "why": "Calibration accounts for heat absorbed by the calorimeter itself, improving accuracy by correcting for systematic errors caused by the apparatus rather than just the solution.",
      "example": "Applying 5.25 V and 2.25 A for 45.75 s produces a temperature increase of 1.64°C, giving CF = (5.25 × 2.25 × 45.75)/1.64 = 330 J °C⁻¹.",

      "why": "This method verifies calorimeter accuracy using well-characterized chemical reactions, providing an alternative to electrical calibration that mimics actual experimental conditions more closely.",
      "example": "Dissolving 1.00 g KNO3 (0.0099 mol) causing a 2.01°C decrease gives CF = (0.0099 × 34900)/2.01 = 172 J °C⁻¹ for the calorimeter.",

      "code": "2B.6",
      "what": "Temperature-time graphs show temperature changes over the course of calibration or reaction. The calibration factor is determined from the temperature change (ΔT) read from the graph, either directly or by extrapolating a line of best fit back to the starting time.",
      "why": "Graphical analysis accounts for heat loss over time and allows accurate determination of the actual temperature change caused by the reaction rather than environmental factors.",
      "example": "A graph showing temperature rising from 18.0°C to 23.0°C with extrapolation gives ΔT = 5.0°C, which is then used in CF = E/ΔT calculations for electrical calibration.",

      "title": "I can calculate energy released using the calibration factor",
      "code": "2B.7",
      "what": "Once the calibration factor is known, energy released in a reaction is calculated using E = CF × ΔT, where CF is in J °C⁻¹ and ΔT is the temperature change from the reaction being measured.",
      "why": "Using the calibration factor provides more accurate energy values by accounting for heat absorbed by the calorimeter apparatus itself, not just the solution.",
      "example": "With CF = 320 J °C⁻¹ and ΔT = 1.23°C for a neutralization reaction, energy released equals E = 320 × 1.23 = 394 J or 0.394 kJ.",

      "why": "Efficiency calculations reveal energy losses due to incomplete combustion, heat loss to surroundings, and other systematic errors, providing insight into calorimeter performance and combustion completeness.",
      "example": "If 1.5 g ethanol produces 15.5 kJ experimentally but theory predicts 44.4 kJ (from 29.6 kJ g⁻¹), efficiency = (15.5/44.4) × 100% = 34.9%.",

      "code": "2B.9",
      "what": "Random errors cause unpredictable variations in measurements (like minor temperature fluctuations), while systematic errors cause consistent deviations in one direction (like heat loss through poor insulation).",
      "why": "Understanding error types guides experimental improvement strategies, as random errors are reduced by repeated trials while systematic errors require changes to equipment or procedure.",
      "example": "Consistently low temperature readings indicate systematic error from heat loss, while temperature readings varying randomly around the mean indicate random measurement error.",
