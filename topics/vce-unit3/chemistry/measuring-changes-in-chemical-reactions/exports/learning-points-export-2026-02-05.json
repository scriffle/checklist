      "why": "Efficiency calculations reveal energy losses due to incomplete combustion, heat loss to surroundings, and other systematic errors, providing insight into calorimeter performance and combustion completeness.",
      "example": "If 1.5 g ethanol produces 15.5 kJ experimentally but theory predicts 44.4 kJ (from 29.6 kJ g⁻¹), efficiency = (15.5/44.4) × 100% = 34.9%.",

      "why": "Understanding error types guides experimental improvement strategies, as random errors are reduced by repeated trials while systematic errors require changes to equipment or procedure.",
