      "question": "When does a spontaneous redox reaction occur according to the electrochemical series?",
      "correct": "When the oxidising agent is higher on the left and the reducing agent is lower on the right",
      "correctExplanation": "A spontaneous reaction requires the oxidising agent (left side, higher E°) to react with the reducing agent (right side, lower E°). This is the 'top-left reacts with bottom-right' rule.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "When the oxidising agent is lower on the left and the reducing agent is higher on the right", "explanation": "This describes the reverse (non-spontaneous) arrangement. The oxidising agent must be higher, not lower." },

      "question": "Will Pb²⁺(aq) spontaneously react with Cd(s)?",
      "correct": "Yes, because Pb²⁺ is higher on the left and Cd is lower on the right of the ECS",
      "correctExplanation": "Pb²⁺ (E° = −0.13 V, left side) is higher than Cd²⁺/Cd (E° = −0.40 V). Cd (right side, lower) is the reducing agent. Top-left reacts with bottom-right = spontaneous.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "No, because both species have negative E° values", "explanation": "Negative E° values do not prevent reactions. What matters is the relative position: Pb²⁺ is higher than Cd²⁺/Cd." },
        { "answer": "No, because Pb²⁺ and Cd are both metals and metals do not react with each other", "explanation": "Pb²⁺ is an ion (not a metal), and metals can react with metal ions if the ECS positions are correct." },
        { "answer": "Yes, because both species have negative E° values, which always means a reaction occurs", "explanation": "The sign of E° alone does not determine spontaneity. It is the relative position on the ECS that matters." }

      "correctExplanation": "Ni²⁺ (E° = −0.25 V) is lower than Pb²⁺ (E° = −0.13 V). For a spontaneous reaction, the oxidising agent must be higher on the left. The positions are reversed here.",
      "distractors": [

        { "answer": "Because they have identical E° values and cancel each other out completely", "explanation": "They have different E° values (−0.13 V and −0.40 V). The issue is that both are on the same side (left)." },
        { "answer": "Because both are positively charged ions and like charges always repel each other", "explanation": "Charge repulsion is not the reason. The issue is that both are oxidising agents with no reducing agent present." },
