TITLE: I can explain the role and importance of separating half-cells in galvanic cells
CODE: 3C.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
Separated half-cells prevent direct contact between oxidising and reducing agents, forcing electrons to travel through the external circuit rather than transferring directly, converting chemical energy to electrical energy instead of heat.

WHY (importance):
Without separation, spontaneous exothermic reactions release energy as heat (as when zinc is placed directly in copper sulfate), making the energy unusable for electrical devices.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
When Zn(s) is placed directly in Cu2+(aq) solution, heat is produced. When separated in a galvanic cell, the same reaction produces 1.10 volts of electrical energy to power devices.

SUBTOPIC: Galvanic Cell Features
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic examines the design features of galvanic cells, including the roles of separated half-cells, electrodes, salt bridges, and electrolytes. It covers how these components work together to convert chemical energy from spontaneous redox reactions into usable electrical energy.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding galvanic cell design is essential for battery technology, fuel cells, and electrochemical applications. These principles explain how batteries work, why certain designs are chosen, and how to optimize cell performance for different applications.

TOPIC: Galvanic Cells
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Study of redox reactions, oxidation numbers, and electrochemical cells that convert chemical energy to electrical energy. Includes writing balanced half-equations, understanding galvanic cell design, and using the electrochemical series to predict reactions and calculate cell potentials.

GALVANIC CELLS
Introduction
Society is becoming more and more reliant on portable electrical energy.
Mobile phones, cameras, drones, remote controls, calculators, car batteries
and laptops are just a few examples where the convenience of this energy being

as a means of storing and providing electrical energy. In this chapter, you will uncover
the chemistry behind the production of electrical energy by galvanic cells. You will
revisit redox reactions that produce electrical energy, learn about the features of
galvanic cells and use the electrochemical series to predict reactions and calculate the
potential voltage that can be generated by specific galvanic cells.

What is oxidation?
You have likely heard of reduction and oxidation from your study of chemistry.
However, where did these terms come from, and when and how were redox reactions
first discovered?
The terms ‘reduction’ and ‘oxidation’ stem from the historical exploration of
combustion, which was the first type of oxidation studied. In 1775, English scientist,
Joseph Priestley, who had discovered oxygen about a year earlier, met with French
chemist, Antoine Lavoisier, who went on to revolutionise the field of chemistry by
investigating the role of oxygen in combustion reactions. Lavoisier’s work helped to
later establish that combustion reactions involved materials combining with oxygen,
and these reactions were classified as oxidation reactions. Alternatively, those reactions
where oxygen was produced were classified as reduction reactions.
Often, when oxygen is involved in a reaction, it will be acting as an oxidising agent.
However, this is not always the case; but when redox reactions were first discovered by
Priestley and Lavoisier, they believed that oxygen was always involved, which is another
reason why the term ‘oxidation’ was adopted.
Figure 3A–1 French chemist Antoine Lavoisier revolutionised the field of
chemistry with his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion reactions.

EXPLAIN
Most of the material in the following two sections is also covered in Units 1 and 2. However,
it is also assessable in Units 3 and 4, hence its inclusion. Where possible, questions and
examples have been altered. However, please note that in Section 3B, new material has
been added in order to cover redox reactions under basic conditions. This was not required
learning for the Units 1 and 2 course and is potentially examinable content.
What is redox?
The word redox is a combined abbreviation for reduction and oxidation, which are two
different processes that occur simultaneously during a redox reaction. A redox reaction
involves an electron transfer from one chemical species to another.
Therefore, reduction can be defined as the gain of electrons and oxidation as the loss of
electrons. A nice way to remember this is using the mnemonic OILRIG – Oxidation Is Loss
(of electrons), Reduction Is Gain (of electrons).

NOTE
There is also a ‘rule of thumb’, most often used by organic chemists, which identifies a species in
a reaction as being oxidised due to a gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen, or being reduced due to
a loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen. Note, however, that redox reactions do not always involve
hydrogen or oxygen.
The reaction between solid magnesium ribbon and oxygen gas, if performed at high
temperatures, produces solid magnesium oxide. The redox equation for this reaction can
be written as

Reducing agents and oxidising agents
You should recall that ionic compounds are formed when there is a large difference in the
electronegativities of the bonding atoms. This commonly occurs between a non-metal
and a group 1 metal, a group 2 metal or a transition metal with a low oxidation number.
In a similar way, the redox reaction between magnesium and oxygen involves a transfer
of electrons from the magnesium atoms to the oxygen atoms. Given that oxidation is
the loss of electrons, in this reaction magnesium has undergone oxidation; it has been
oxidised. Similarly, the oxygen has undergone reduction; it has been reduced, since it is
the molecule that gained the electrons.

Reducing agent

It is also useful to identify the reducing agent and the oxidising agent in a reaction. The
species that causes oxidation of the other reactant (species) is termed the oxidising agent.
The species that causes reduction to occur to the other species is termed the reducing agent.
In the example on the previous page, magnesium causes the reduction of oxygen gas and
at the same time undergoes oxidation itself, losing electrons. Thus, magnesium can be
identified as the reducing agent in this reaction. Similarly, oxygen causes the oxidation
of magnesium and at the same time undergoes reduction itself, gaining electrons. Thus,
oxygen can be identified as the oxidising agent in this reaction.

OXIDATION
NUMBERS
Oxidation numbers
It is not always easy to identify whether electrons are being transferred or not in a chemical
reaction, nor is it obvious which species is gaining or losing them. To help identify whether
a species is gaining or losing electrons and consequently whether it is undergoing reduction
or oxidation, we can use oxidation numbers.
Writing oxidation numbers
While not official IUPAC convention, oxidation numbers are easily represented when
written directly above the element as –1, 0, +1, +2 and so on. It is important to distinguish
between this format and that of an ion. For example, the magnesium ion, Mg2+, has an ionic
charge of 2+, but its oxidation number is written as +2, usually like this:
+2 Oxidation number
Mg
2+
Assigning oxidation numbers
You can work out the oxidation number of an unknown element by applying several rules
to identify the oxidation numbers in other elements present in a species. Although many
elements will often have the same oxidation number, some elements can have multiple
oxidation numbers. One example of this is nitrogen, which can have oxidation numbers
ranging from –3 to +5!
The rules to follow when assigning oxidation numbers, as well as exceptions to some rules
that are particularly important to remember, are summarised in Table 3A–1.

3A REDUCTION AND OXIDATION
81
Table 3A–1 Oxidation numbers rules and examples
Category Rule Example(s)
Free elements
Oxidation number = 0 (zero)
A free element is any element that
exists on its own and that is not a
charged ion. It may be monoatomic
or polyatomic but must contain only
one type of element.
Solid iron metal, Fe(s)
Hydrogen gas, H2(g)
Oxygen gas, O2(g)
Sulfur, S8(s)
Carbon, C(s)
Hydrogen
Typical oxidation
number = +1
Alternative oxidation
number = –1
The alternative oxidation number
only occurs when hydrogen is
part of a metal hydride. This is
because metal hydrides are ionic
compounds, and as such, the metal
ion will have an oxidation number
equal to its charge. To achieve an
overall neutral charge for metal
hydrides, hydrogen must have an
oxidation number of –1.
Methane, CH4
In this neutral molecule, hydrogen will
have its typical oxidation number of +1.
Exception: Sodium hydride, NaH.
In this case, the sodium ion will have an
oxidation number of +1, and the hydrogen
will have an oxidation number of –1.
Oxygen
Typical oxidation
number = –2
Alternative oxidation
number = –1
Oxygen will typically have an
oxidation number of –2 when it is
not a free element. The alternative
oxidation number occurs only when
oxygen is part of a peroxide, such as
hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
Carbon dioxide, CO2
In this neutral molecule, oxygen will have
an oxidation number of –2.
Exception: Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
In this molecule, hydrogen will have an
oxidation number of +1, and oxygen will
have an oxidation number of –1.
Pure ions
Oxidation number = ionic
charge
Pure ions have an oxidation number
equal to their ionic charge.
Aluminium ions, Al3+
These ions will have an ionic charge of 3+
and an oxidation number of +3.
Neutral compounds
The sum of the oxidation
numbers will be 0 (zero).
Neutral compounds, as well as
having an overall neutral charge,
will also be neutral in their overall
oxidation number total.
Water, H2O
In the neutral molecule of water, hydrogen
has an oxidation number of +1 and oxygen
has an oxidation number of –2. There are
two hydrogen atoms, so overall:
(2 × +1) + (–2) = 0.
Polyatomic ions
The sum of the oxidation
numbers = charge on
the ion
Polyatomic ions have an overall
oxidation number equal to the
charge on the polyatomic ion.
Sulfate ions, SO4
2–
These polyatomic ions have an overall
ionic charge of 2–. Oxygen has an
oxidation number of –2, and there are four
atoms of oxygen, so 4 × –2 = –8. Sulfur
must have an oxidation number of +6, to
match the overall charge on the ion.
–8 + (+6) = –2.
NOTE
The most electronegative element in a compound must be assigned a negative oxidation number.
Therefore, fluorine, being the most electronegative element, will always have an oxidation
number of –1. There are no exceptions to this scenario. More generally, group 17 halogens usually
have an oxidation number of –1, but not always. Chlorine, in some cases, can have a positive
oxidation number. An example of this is chlorine dioxide, ClO2, where chlorine has an oxidation
number of +4 because oxygen is more electronegative than chlorine and hence is assigned the
oxidation number of –2.

Using oxidation numbers
Identifying reducing agents and oxidising agents
A change in oxidation number of an element can be used to identify reducing agents and
oxidising agents. If the oxidation number increases for an element during a reaction, it
indicates that it has undergone oxidation, losing electrons (hence becoming ‘more positive’)
and is therefore called the reducing agent. Similarly, if the oxidation number decreases for
an element during a reaction, it indicates that it has undergone reduction, gaining electrons
(hence becoming ‘less positive’) and is therefore identified as the oxidising agent.
+2 0
Fe2+(aq) + 2e– Fe(s)
In the equation shown above, Fe2+(aq) ions are reduced because the oxidation number of
iron decreases from +2 to 0. Fe(s) has gained electrons.

3A REDUCTION AND OXIDATION
83
In half-equations such as this, an alternative way to determine whether reduction or
oxidation is taking place is to identify on which side of the equation the electrons are
present. If electrons are on the left-hand side, as shown in Figure 3A–2, then it is a
reduction half-equation. If electrons are on the right-hand side, then it is an oxidation
half-equation.

Solution

Pb2+(aq) + Zn(s) Pb(s) + Zn2+(aq)
Step 3 Answer the question
by using the change in
oxidation numbers of the
atoms/ions.
Pb2+(aq) ions have been reduced since the
oxidation number decreases from +2 to 0.
Zn(s) has been oxidised to Zn2+(aq) ions because
its oxidation number has increased from 0 to +2.
Zn(s) can be identified as the reducing agent, and
Pb2+(aq) ions are therefore the oxidising agent.
Important considerations when using oxidation numbers
In many redox reactions, the same elements are often involved as reactants and as
products. It is particularly important to note the difference in states and charges when
you are describing changes in a redox reaction or when you are asked to identify reducing
agents or oxidising agents. For example, copper ions, Cu2+(aq), are a different chemical
species compared to copper solid, Cu(s).
In addition, where the element whose oxidation number changes during a redox reaction
belongs to a polyatomic species, you should include the entire reactant compound that
contains the element when naming the reducing agent or oxidising agent. Consider

Step 3 Answer the question
by using the change

Iron, Fe, shows an oxidation number change from +3 to
0, meaning that it has been reduced (gained electrons).
However, if you were stating the oxidising agent, you
would state iron oxide, Fe2O3(s), as this is the chemical
species causing the oxidation of the carbon monoxide.
Similarly, the reducing agent for this reaction would be
identified as carbon monoxide, CO(g), even though only
the carbon undergoes an oxidation number increase
(due to oxidation, loss of electrons).

Identifying redox couples
During a redox reaction, the species acting as a reducing agent on the reactant side donates
(loses) electrons and in doing so forms a product that is an oxidising agent. At the same
time, the reactant acting as the oxidising agent is converted into a product that is a reducing
agent. The association of each reactant and the product it forms during a redox reaction is
referred to as a redox couple.
For example, when copper metal undergoes oxidation, losing electrons, the copper ions
produced could act as an oxidising agent, gaining electrons.
Redox couple
Cu(s) Cu2+(aq) + 2e–

In a similar way, when zinc ions undergo reduction to zinc solid, the zinc solid could then

3A REDUCTION AND OXIDATION
85
Your ability to identify redox couples will be equally important in the next section of this
chapter when you explore how to write half-equations from full redox equations. In most
cases, you will be required to identify redox couples in full redox reactions rather than in
half-equations. Each redox reaction will therefore have two redox couples.
To identify a redox couple, the following are required:
1 There must be one species on the reactant side and one species on the product side of
the equation containing the same element.
2 There must be a change in oxidation number.
Figure 3A–3 shows that copper has an oxidation number of +2 in copper oxide, CuO, on
the reactant side, which decreases to 0 in copper (solid) on the product side. This is the
first redox couple. In a similar way, the hydrogen gas and water can be identified as the
second redox couple, where hydrogen shows an increase in oxidation number from
0 to +1.

during a redox reaction, it means that element is not undergoing reduction or oxidation.

Importance of oxidation numbers
In this section, you have seen the value of being able to assign and use oxidation
numbers. The following important steps help you to do this.
1 Identify reactions as redox reactions (or not).
2 Identify reduction.
3 Identify oxidation.
4 Identify reducing agents.
5 Identify oxidising agents.
6 Identify redox couples.
7 Identify the movement of electrons.
Concept-mapping from key glossary terms
This section has explored much of the underlying chemistry and key definitions for redox
reactions, including how to identify reduction, oxidation, reducing agents, oxidising
agents, redox couples and ways of assigning and using oxidation numbers. Table 3A–2
and Figure 3A–4 summarise the key concepts covered but also highlight how the
language you need to know and understand has a lot of similarities. This can sometimes
cause confusion initially, so it is important to use the glossary terms throughout this
chapter to help you solidify your understanding of the language used. A useful activity to
consolidate your ability to correctly use these terms is to create your own concept map
showing connections between the terms. You could also annotate the concept map at
the beginning of the chapter to further consolidate the connections between the related
terminology used.

What conditions are needed for redox reactions?
What conditions are needed for a redox reaction to take place? Do they even matter?
Redox reactions can take place in a range of conditions, including neutral, basic or acidic
conditions. These conditions do have some influence over what species are involved
during a redox reaction and are important to consider when writing balanced equations
for a given scenario.
In basic conditions, the OH– ions play a role in the redox reactions that can take place.
You might already be familiar with alkaline batteries; these are examples of redox
reactions taking place in basic conditions. Car batteries, on the other hand, are an
example of redox reactions taking place in acidic conditions. You will learn more about
batteries and cells and their conditions in Section 3C.

Simple half-equations
You should recall that redox reactions involve both reduction and oxidation. As you have
already seen in Section 3A, reduction and oxidation reactions can be written as separate
half-equations, which show the electrons either as reactants in reduction half-equations or
as products in oxidation half-equations. These are referred to as simple half-equations.

3B WRITING REDOX EQUATIONS
89
When writing simple half-equations, which contain only one type of element, there are a
few steps that you need to follow. Applying the acronym ECS will help you to remember
these three critical steps.
1 Write the species on the correct side of the equation and then balance the Element
involved.
2 Balance the Charges in the equation. This is done by adding the appropriate number of
electrons to the more positive side of the half-equation. Note that you can apply your
understanding of oxidation numbers to each element in an equation to determine this.
3 Finally, ensure that you have included correct States for each element listed.
NOTE
When assigning states for redox equations in this course, note the following points.
1 Ions are always aqueous, (aq).
2 Electrons have no state.
3 Water, H2O, is always liquid, (l).

Balancing in basic conditions
Balancing redox reactions in basic, or alkaline, conditions is slightly more complicated than
the steps involved for acidic conditions. The main reason is that each redox half-equation will
have both hydrogen ions, H+
, and hydroxide ions, OH–, added to it. These ions then combine
to make water, so there is some additional cancelling that takes place. We can still use the
KOHES method, but remember to include the two additional steps, which are shown below.
Step Explanation

Combining half-equations
You should recall that redox reactions involve a transfer of electrons, where reduction and
oxidation both occur simultaneously. That is, you can’t have one without the other, and the
number of electrons that the oxidising agent gains, must be equal to the number of electrons
that the reducing agent loses. When considering half-equations, this means that the number
of electrons on the left-hand side of a reduction half-equation must be equal to the number
of electrons on the right-hand side of the corresponding oxidation half-equation.
In situations where the number of electrons differ in each half-equation, you must find the
lowest common multiple for the number of electrons. Do this by multiplying one or both
half-equations to ensure that the numbers of electrons are equal to this lowest common
multiple value. The half-equations can then be added or combined to give the full, overall
redox equation. Worked example 3B–5 shows you how to do this.
VIDEO

EXAMPLE 3B–5
Worked example 3B–5: Combining redox half-equations
Write the combined redox equation for the reaction between silver ions and nickel metal.
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write each of the balanced half-equations
that take place.
Process
Ag+(aq) + e–
→ Ag(s)
Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 2 Balance the electrons in each equation by
finding the lowest common multiple.
The silver half-equation only has one
electron, whereas the nickel half-equation
contains two electrons.
To balance the electrons, we need to multiply
the silver half-equation by 2.
2 × (Ag+(aq) + e–
2Ag+(aq) + 2e–
→ Ag(s))
→ 2Ag(s)
Step 3 Combine the half-equations by adding them
together. A simple way of doing this is to write
each species that is on the left of the arrow
of the half-equations together on the left and
write each species that is on the right of the
arrow of the half-equations together on the
right.
Note that it is important to place the arrows
directly below each other.
2Ag+(aq) + 2e–
→ 2Ag(s)
Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
_________________________________________
2Ag+(aq) + 2e– + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 4 The electrons on the left-hand side of the
arrow cancel out those on the right-hand
side, leaving the full balanced redox equation.
2Ag+(aq) + 2e– + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
_________________________________________
2Ag+(aq) + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq)

NOTE
There is sometimes a rare case where the reduction and oxidation reactions both result in the
same product being formed. An example of this is shown below.
Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 4H+(aq) + 2SO4

The redox couples for such a reaction would each have the same product as indicated below.

Sometimes it is possible for the opposite to happen, where the same species in a redox reaction
acts as both the reducing agent and the oxidising agent. In one half-reaction it would undergo
reduction, and in the other half-reaction it would undergo oxidation. These are uncommon
circumstances but are important to be aware of.

EQUATIONS
Key things to check when writing balanced equations
It is important that you are able to write balanced equations, particularly in this section
of the course. Below are a few points to remember that you may find helpful.
1 Never change the subscripted numbers in a formula. This is only done when balancing
the formula of ionic compounds based on the individual charges of the cation and the
anion.
2 Only ever change coeﬃcients to balance elements.
3 A balanced equation must have the same number of each element on both the
reactant and product sides.
4 Charges on both the reactant and product sides must always be the same. One
common mistake is adding electrons to each side of a redox equation to make the
charges equal zero on both sides. Sometimes the charges will be zero, other times
positive or negative. They simply need to be the same on each side.
5 Finally, always make sure that you add states to any equations you write.
Let’s look at an example to apply these rules.

96 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
In the 1840s, a telegraph system used an early version of an electric primary cell that
consisted of two half-cells, each with an electrode and an aqueous electrolyte, which
were:
• a zinc electrode (Zn) in dilute sulfuric acid solution (H2SO4).
• a platinum electrode (Pt) in concentrated nitric acid (HNO3).
In the nitric acid half-cell, aqueous nitrate ions, NO3
–, were converted into nitrogen
dioxide, NO2.
Write the half-equation for this reaction by following these steps.
1 Write the initial reactant and products without changing the subscripts present
NO3
–
⇌ NO2
2 Balance the elements by following the steps in KOHES, which will change the
coeﬃcients.
NO3
– + 2H+ ⇌ NO2 + H2O
3 Check that the same number of elements is present on both the reactant and product
sides of the equation – which they are.
4 The reactant side of the equation has an overall charge of +1 (–1 + 2), whereas the
product side of the equation has an overall charge of 0. Therefore, balance the charges
by adding electrons to the more positive side, in this case the reactant side (one
electron needed).

– + 2H+ + e– ⇌ NO2 + H2O

Batteries are everywhere!
In a world where technology is advancing and
the number of portable and mobile gadgets
is increasing, have you ever wondered when
batteries were first invented, or what is it about
a battery that makes it possible to provide the
electrical energy to power these devices?
There are many different types of batteries in
use today. Some larger batteries store huge
amounts of power generated by solar farms,
others may be used to power electric cars, while
many are much smaller and can be found in
Figure 3C–1 Italian scientist Alessandro
Volta and his voltaic pile ‘battery’
consisting of alternating silver and
zinc discs
watches and hearing aids. Despite their size
differences, essentially all of them have a similar design enabling a redox chemical
reaction to take place that converts stored chemical energy into usable electrical energy.
American scientist and inventor, Benjamin Franklin, first used the term ‘battery’ in
the mid-1700s but it is believed that the first true battery was made by Italian scientist
Alessandro Volta in 1800. He created a stack of alternating discs of silver and zinc,
separated by cloth soaked in salt water, to generate a current. Since there were
no instruments available to detect weak currents at the time, he tested his batteries by
using his tongue! Volta discovered that changing the types of metals used, as well as
changing the number of discs, had an effect on the amount of current that the battery
could produce.
Another battery that you might already be familiar with is the lead–acid battery, which
was invented in the mid-1800s. It was the first-ever rechargeable battery and is still
commonly used today to provide the electrical energy needed to start cars and other
vehicles. Batteries are examples of galvanic cells, which are central to this section of the
Study Design.

EXPLAIN
Electrochemical cells
Electrochemical cells are systems that can convert stored chemical energy into electrical
energy or that can use electrical energy supplied to facilitate chemical reactions. Some can
even do both! In this chapter, we will focus on the former, also referred to as ‘galvanic cells’.
Galvanic cells are one type of electrochemical cell and involve spontaneous redox reactions.
NOTE
It is helpful to recognise that there are a number of interchangeable terms used when discussing
galvanic cells: ‘voltaic cell’, ‘primary cell’ and even the term ‘battery’ may all be used to reference
a galvanic cell. Essentially, they are equivalent in that they refer to an electrochemical cell that
spontaneously produces electrical energy from chemical energy.

Figure 3C–2 shows the spontaneous
redox reaction that occurs when solid
zinc metal, Zn(s), is placed directly
into a solution of copper(II) sulfate
containing copper ions, Cu2+(aq).
The overall redox reaction for this
process is:
Cu2+(aq) + Zn(s) → Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq)
Since the reactants are in direct
contact with each other, when the
reaction takes place, electrons are
exchanged directly in an exothermic
reaction, and chemical energy is
converted into thermal energy, which
is released into the surroundings
as heat.

energy, galvanic cells are systems
that separate the two reactants instead of allowing them to be in direct contact with one
another. This allows for the transformation of chemical energy into electrical energy that
can be harnessed and used to provide power. Without this separation, a spontaneous
exothermic reaction would still occur, involving a direct exchange of electrons between
the reactants. This would produce heat energy instead of the electrical energy that can be
generated by a galvanic cell.

Features of galvanic cells
Galvanic cells are designed with a number of important features to ensure that electrical
energy can be produced. Figure 3C–3 shows a representation of a specific galvanic cell
called the Daniell cell, which was one of the first galvanic cells, invented by English
chemist John Daniell in 1836. It includes many of the essential features common to all
galvanic cells and is simple enough that you can reproduce it in the laboratory.

chemist, John Daniell
Half-cells
Galvanic cells are comprised of two half-cells, which must be separated in order to produce
electrical energy. In Figure 3C–3 above, the Daniell cell has two beakers separating the
reactants. Each half-cell contains a solid conducting electrode partially submerged in a
solution of ions. It is on the surface of these electrodes where the reduction and oxidation
reactions take place. From Section 3A, we know that reduction involves a ‘gain’ of electrons,
while oxidation involves the production or ‘loss’ of electrons. In a galvanic cell, the
electrode where reduction occurs is called the cathode, which is also the positive terminal of
the cell. The electrode where oxidation occurs is called the anode, which in a galvanic cell is
also the negative terminal of the cell. The positive or negative ‘charge’ on these electrodes is
more accurately referred to as the electrode polarity.
Electrodes
In Figure 3C–4, solid zinc, Zn(s), is acting as the anode in the oxidation half-cell, which
also contains a solution of zinc ions, Zn2+(aq). Solid copper, Cu(s), is the cathode in the
reduction half-cell, which also contains a solution of copper(II) ions, Cu2+(aq). You might
recognise the species in each half-cell as conjugate redox pairs. Each half-cell contains a
reducing agent and a conjugate oxidising agent. In most galvanic cells, a metal is part of
the conjugate redox pair and is therefore often used as an electrode. When this is the case,
the electrodes are reactive and take part in the redox reactions occurring. During such

reactions, it is possible to observe an increase in mass at the cathode, where ions are
converted to solid metal atoms (reduction occurs). Conversely, at the anode, where metal
atoms are converted into ions, it is possible to observe a decrease in the mass of the metal
electrode being used (oxidation occurs).

Sometimes the conjugate redox pair in a half-cell does not include a metal, in which case
an inert electrode, such as graphite or platinum, may be used instead. These materials still
conduct electricity, but importantly, are not involved in the actual half-reactions that take
place on their surfaces. A final point worth noting about electrodes is that some half-
cells involving gases, such as hydrogen, oxygen or chlorine, may even have a special ‘gas
electrode’. Where the gas is a product of the reaction, there needs to be a way for the gas to
escape. If the gas is a reactant, however, it is usually necessary for the gas to be bubbled into
the solution surrounding the electrode. Figure 3C–5 shows an electrochemical cell that uses
these gas electrodes.

102 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
NOTE
Half-cells usually contain the species that react, but it is important to note that it is also possible for
other species that are not involved in the reaction to be present. Sometimes there may be multiple
ions present in a solution, often used to supply the reactive ions to the solution. For example, in the
Daniell cell, the copper ions are supplied by copper(II) sulfate. Sulfate ions, SO4
2– are also present
but would be considered spectator ions as they do not take part in the actual reaction.
Salt bridge

circuit in a
galvanic cell and
contains ions
that balance the
charges formed
from each
half-cell
Electrolyte
a non-reactive
solution or paste
that enables the
flow of charged
particles
and helps to
facilitate the
redox reactions
The salt bridge
The salt bridge plays three important roles in a galvanic cell:
1 It connects the circuit, allowing for the flow of charged particles through the circuit
2 It allows for the physical separation of half-cells, preventing reactants from coming into
direct contact with each other
3 It is usually soaked in a non-reactive electrolyte solution consisting of cations and anions
that can migrate into the solutions to balance the charges of the reaction occurring in
each half-cell (as shown in Figure 3C–4 with Na+ and Cl– ions).
Without a salt bridge, charge would accumulate in each of the cells and the redox reaction
would soon cease.
Two common electrolytes used in galvanic cells are concentrated potassium nitrate, KNO3,
and concentrated potassium chloride, KCl; however, other substances may also be used,
including sodium sulfate, Na2SO4, and sodium chloride, NaCl. Often the salt bridge is
simply a piece of filter paper soaked in the electrolyte and draped across the two solutions
in each beaker.
Migration of ions from the salt bridge
Consider the redox reactions taking place in the Daniell cell shown in Figure 3C–4.
Reduction at the cathode: Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Oxidation at the anode: Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e–
If we focus on the reduction reaction, we can see that it is using positive cations from the
solution and converting them to neutral solid metal atoms. As a result, those cations are
essentially removed from the solution as they take part in the reaction, so there would start
to be an imbalance between the cations and anions in the solution. To balance the charges,
positively charged cations from the salt bridge migrate into the solution of the reduction
half-cell. For example, if NaCl is the electrolyte solution being used in the cell, it would
be sodium ions, Na+, that migrate towards the cathode. It is important to note that this
‘balancing’ of charge is happening in real-time and that if it did not, the galvanic cell would
cease to function.
Looking at the anode reaction, the opposite is occurring, as solid zinc metal atoms are
oxidised to zinc ions, Zn2+. In this half-cell, the balance of charge in the solution would
start to shift to have more cations than anions, so to balance this change, negatively charged
anions migrate from the salt bridge towards the anode. If NaCl is the electrolyte solution
being used in the cell, it would mean chloride ions, Cl–, perform this function.

3C FEATURES OF GALVANIC CELLS
103
NOTE
An easy way to remember this movement of ions in the electrolyte (salt) bridge is:
– anions to the anode
– cations to the cathode.
As well as observing a change in mass at the cathode and anode, sometimes other
important observations can be made that provide some indication that a reaction is taking
place within a galvanic cell. In some half-cells, gases may be produced in a half-reaction
that result in bubbles forming on the surface of the electrode. Another observation might
be a change in appearance of the solvent used in a half-cell. For example, in the Daniell cell,
the copper(II) sulfate solution has a blue colour. However, as the reaction proceeds and
copper ions in that solution undergo reduction, the concentration of copper ions, Cu2+, will
decrease and the intensity of that blue coloured solution will also decrease over time.
The external circuit
The separation of reactants in a galvanic cell is crucial and allows the electrons produced
by oxidation at the anode to flow to the cathode where they then take part in the reduction
reaction. It is important to recognise that the electrons do not move into the solutions.
Instead, the electrons flow from one electrode to the other via the external circuit, which is
made up of wires connecting the electrodes. In some cell diagrams you may see light globes
used in place of the voltmeter shown in Figure 3C–3 or 3C–4, which would glow when
current flows through the external circuit.
Voltmeter

used for
measuring
electrical
potential
NOTE
An important skill is to determine the direction of flow of electrons. Although it should be
possible to work out the direction by looking at the half-equations to see where the electrons
are being used and where they are being produced, another convenient way to remember the
direction is that they travel from the anode to the cathode (A to the C), which is in alphabetical
order.

104 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Drawing and labelling galvanic cell diagrams
A key skill is being able to use the information about a reaction taking place in a galvanic
cell to draw and/or label key aspects of the cell. This might include:
• writing the half-reactions or overall reaction occurring in the cell
• labelling the anode and cathode
• labelling the polarity of the electrodes
• labelling the direction of electron flow
• labelling the direction of flow of ions from the salt bridge.
Being able to determine many of these characteristics relies on identifying the cathode and
the anode. To assist with this, make use of the galvanic cell mnemonic (memory aid): the
Happy Red Cat.
• Happy corresponds to the positive terminal.
• Red corresponds to reduction.
• Cat corresponds to cathode.
In galvanic cells, these three aspects always combine in the reduction half-cell, so you only
need to identify one of the three aspects to quickly work out the other two. The opposite
holds true for the oxidation half-cell: negative, oxidation and anode.

Solution
Step 1 Logic There is no specific order in which to
approach a question like this, but the
key is to identify what information you
are given and to then try to apply the
‘happy red cat’ mnemonic.
By identifying the reactions shown
for each half-cell, and applying what
we already understand about redox
reactions, we can see the equation
on the left for zinc is producing two
electrons. Therefore, ‘E’ is oxidation.
We can also see that in the half-
reaction on the right the copper ions
are combining with two electrons,
which means that ‘I’ is reduction.
Process
Loss of electrons:
Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e–
Therefore, ‘E’ is oxidation.
Gain of electrons:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Therefore, ‘I’ is reduction.

106 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Step 2 We can then apply the ‘happy red cat’
to labels F and G.
Happy red cat:
Happy: positive
Red: reduction, which occurs on the
right-hand side.
Cat: cathode must also be on the
right-hand side.
Therefore, ‘F’ is cathode and ‘G’ is
positive.
Step 3 By elimination, this tells us which
terms correspond to labels B and C.
If ‘F’ is the cathode, ‘B’ is the anode
and ‘C’ is negative.
Step 4 The direction of electron flow can now
be determined, as we know electrons
flow from anode to the cathode (A to
the C).
Electrons flow from left to right in
this cell, so an arrow pointing right is
appropriate for ‘A’ on the diagram.
Step 5 For ion flow, we know that anions flow
to the anode and cations flow to the
cathode.
Because KNO3 is shown as the
electrolyte solution, the anions would
be nitrate ions, NO3
–, and the cations
would be potassium ions, K+. We can
now add these species to labels D and
H respectively.
Step 6 Complete the diagram. See below.

Potential difference
Under the same conditions, the type of reactants being used will influence the amount of
voltage that can be produced by a galvanic cell. The voltage produced is caused by the potential
difference in the amount of energy that the valence electrons have in atoms of different
elements. Electrons flow through the external circuit because of this difference in potential
energy between the two electrodes. More simply, the reactant in one half-cell has a stronger
tendency to move electrons through the circuit compared to the other half-cell. The greater
the difference between the two reactants, the greater the potential voltage the cell will be.

Figure 3D–1 Two similar galvanic cells. The voltage produced in the Daniell cell on the
left is 1.10 volts compared to the cell on the right, which can produce 2.62 volts under
the same conditions. In the cell on the right, the zinc half-cell has been replaced with a
magnesium half-cell.
On the Daniell cell represented in Figure 3D–1, on the left-hand side, the voltmeter measuring
the flow of electric current moving between the two half-cells shows that 1.10 volts is being
produced. In the cell shown on the right-hand side, the zinc half-cell has been substituted with
a magnesium half-cell. Under the same conditions, the second cell is able to produce 2.62 volts.
This difference is due to magnesium being more reactive and having a greater tendency to
move electrons through the external circuit compared to the zinc half-cell.
Standard electrode potential
Each half-cell has a unique standard electrode potential, which is the amount of voltage it
can produce at standard conditions. For these experiments, standard conditions refers to
a temperature of 25°C (298 K), solvent concentrations of 1 M and a pressure of 100 kPa.
As redox reactions involve both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously, it
is not possible to measure the electrode potential of one half-cell without connecting it
to another. Reduction occurs in one half-cell, while oxidation occurs simultaneously in
the other. For this reason, a standard hydrogen electrode has been used to determine the
comparative electrode potentials of other half-reactions – this is then referred to as their
standard electrode potentials.
The standard hydrogen electrode
The value of the standard electrode potential for different half-cells has been experimentally
determined using the standard hydrogen electrode as a reference. To develop the scale,
this half-cell was arbitrarily assigned an electrode potential of 0.00 volts under standard
conditions. Other half-cells were then measured against the standard hydrogen electrode to

voltage, or standard cell potential, that a particular galvanic cell can produce. This voltage
may also be referred to as electromotive force, or emf, and is measured in volts.

half-reaction listed highest on the electrochemical series. However, at the anode, oxidation
is taking place, not reduction, so this half-reaction must be reversed. Whenever a reaction
is reversed, the sign for the value of the standard electrode potential must also be reversed.
The oxidation reaction will be the one listed lowest on the electrochemical series, as shown:

FEATURES OF
ELECTROLYTIC
CELLS
LINK
To determine the overall cell potential, or voltage, that can be produced by the zinc–nickel
cell from page 112 under standard conditions, simply add the two standard electrode
potentials together:
–0.25 + (+0.76) = +0.51 volts
A positive value obtained for the cell potential indicates that the reaction is spontaneous,
which is expected in a galvanic cell. This is useful to remember when performing
calculations of cell potentials. A negative value would mean that the electrochemical cell is
an electrolytic cell, not a galvanic cell. Electrolytic cells are covered further in Section 7A.
NOTE
The values should only be added together if the half-equation and standard electrode potentials
are reversed for the anode half-reaction.
A useful way to calculate the cell potential directly from the electrochemical series, without
reversing equations and values, is to use the following rule:
E 0
cell = E 0
Reduction reaction – E 0
Oxidation reaction
In Figure 3D–3, notice that the reduction half-equation for nickel appears higher up in the
electrochemical series, compared to the oxidation reaction for zinc. This will be true for
ALL galvanic cells. This is another alternative way to remember which electrode potential
should be subtracted from the other when calculating cell potentials in galvanic cells, as in
the following rule:
E 0
cell = E 0
Higher half-reaction – E 0
Lower half-reaction
NOTE
As well as stressing the importance of always including units, it is essential to note that the value
for cell potential is directional, and the positive or negative sign must always be written in front
of the value to indicate this.

Predicting redox reactions in galvanic cells
The electrochemical series can be used to help identify whether a reaction will occur
spontaneously. For a reaction to occur, the oxidising agent must be located higher on the
left-hand side of the series, compared to the reducing agent, which must be located lower
and on the right-hand side of the series. If the species are not positioned in this way, no
reaction will occur.

Solution
a Pb2+(aq) is the oxidising agent, as it is the species highest on the left-hand side and
Cd(s) is the reducing agent, as it is located lower on the right-hand side. As such they
will undergo a spontaneous reaction.
b No reaction will occur, since both species are oxidising agents and are both located
on the left-hand side of the electrochemical series.
c No reaction will occur, since Ni2+(aq), as the oxidising agent on the left-hand side is
lower than Pb2+(aq), which is the reducing agent, located higher on the right-hand side.
Identifying reactions using the
electrochemical series
The half-equations occurring in a galvanic cell are
not always provided. However, if all the species
present are known, the electrochemical series can
be used to identify the half-reactions occurring, to
then determine the overall redox reaction and to
calculate the cell potential for a given combination
of reactants. On the electrochemical series, the
species that is highest on the left-hand side of the
electrochemical series will undergo reduction.
The species that is lowest on the right-hand side
will undergo oxidation, meaning the reaction on
the electrochemical series for this half-reaction
must be written in reverse.

Step 3 Write the equations for reduction and
oxidation, remembering to reverse
the oxidation reaction, which is the
lower of the two. It is important to
note the use of correct arrows when
writing these half-equations. The
electrochemical series represents
each reduction half-equation with
equilibrium arrows because it can be
reversed, depending on what else it is
reacting with. However, when writing
half-equations for a particular cell, a
critical part of what we are predicting is
the direction in which these reactions
will occur, and hence the use of a solid
forward arrow is appropriate.

Pb(s) → Pb2+(aq) + 2e–
E 0 = +0.13
Step 4 To determine the cell potential, the
values in Step 3 can be added,
since the oxidation reaction and its
standard electrode potential have
been reversed.
Alternatively, the values can be
substituted straight into the following
equation from the electrochemical
series.

Step 5 Write the overall equation by
balancing electrons and combining
the half-equations. In this example,
there are two electrons in the oxidation
half-equation but only one electron
in the reduction half-equation, which
consequently needs to be doubled.
Now that the number of electrons is
the same on each side, the electrons
can be cancelled to leave the full
redox equation.

Limitations of the electrochemical series
Recall that the electrochemical series was derived using standard laboratory conditions. This
means that unpredictable things may occur when a galvanic cell is placed under conditions
that vary significantly from SLC. Sometimes a different reaction may take place, or there may
in fact be no reaction at all, even if a reaction is predicted to occur spontaneously. Changing
the temperature from 25°C or using solutions that have a concentration different to 1 M, may
result in different reactions taking place. The increased concentration of one particular ion
may mean that it reacts instead of the ions predicted on the electrochemical series. This can
be seen when the electrode potential values, E0, are close together.
One final consideration is that the electrochemical series does not provide any indication
of the reaction rate. Sometimes reactions may be predicted to occur, but they may do so
very slowly. Sometimes reactions may be taking place at such a slow rate that they appear
not to react, even though the electrochemical series predicts that a reaction is taking place.
For example, observing a galvanic cell for 20 minutes may not be sufficient time to observe
products of reactions being formed or other changes expected in the half-cells. You will
study rates of reaction more in Section 5B.
Sometimes, as well as the same species appearing in multiple positions on the electrochemical
series, some half-reactions may also include multiple species. Two examples of this are
shown below where there are hydrogen ions, H+(aq) shown as part of the half-reaction. This
indicates that for the reaction to proceed, there must also be a suitable supply of hydrogen
ions, which would usually mean using an acidic solution. It is important to consider all species
when predicting whether reactions will occur, but also when predicting what the products of
a particular galvanic cell may be. Measuring pH changes or using acid–base indicators may be
one additional way to detect whether a reaction is taking place.

Predicting reactions with more than one type of ion present
In some galvanic cells, electrodes can be inert, in which case they are not considered
when trying to predict the reactions occurring. Similarly, solutions in each half-cell
may contain more than one type of reactive ion. In such cases, it is important to

REACTIONS WITH
MORE THAN ONE
TYPE OF ION
PRESENT
remember redox reactions will only occur between the strongest oxidising agent in the
reduction half-cell and the strongest reducing agent in the oxidation half-cell. If there are many ion species
present, only two will react, and the rest will be considered to be spectator ions.
Some species appear more than once on the electrochemical series on both the left-hand side and right-
hand side of the series. When predicting reactions, all occurrences of each species must be considered to
accurately identify the strongest reducing agent and strongest oxidising agent.
Further consideration should also be given regarding what would happen in a galvanic cell where one of
these ions is completely used up by the reaction. If one completely reacts, the next strongest species will
start to react, provided there is another species available. There would be a decrease in the amount of
voltage produced, but it is important to recognise that whenever other species are present, the reaction
may not simply ‘stop’.
The example below highlights a type of question where more than one type of ion is present, as well as the
worked solution for this example.
Question
A galvanic cell consists of one half-cell with an inert platinum, Pt(s), electrode in a 1 M solution of
Cu2+(aq), Zn2+(aq) and Ni2+(aq) ions. The other half-cell has a solid iron electrode, Fe(s), in a 1 M solution
containing iron(II) ions, Fe2+(aq).

b State which electrode is the anode, and which is the cathode.
c Write the half-reactions occurring initially at the anode and cathode.
d Calculate the standard cell potential.
e Explain what you would expect to observe at the cathode over time.
Solution
Logic Process
Step 1 Use the electrochemical series to
highlight all the reactive species
present. It is often useful to highlight
the species present in one half-cell
differently from those in the other.
This can make it easier to identify
the reduction and oxidation
reactions that will take place.
The species highest on the left-hand
side of a reaction arrow will be the
strongest oxidising agent.
The species lowest on the right-
hand side of a reaction arrow will be

120 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Step 2 To identify the cathode, apply the
‘happy red cat’. Given that the iron
electrode is the strongest reducing
agent, undergoing oxidation, it
must be the anode. Therefore, the
strongest oxidising agent, copper
ions undergo reduction in the other
half-cell, where platinum is the
electrode, the cathode must be
platinum.
b Anode: Fe(s)
Cathode: Pt(s)
Step 3 Having identified the strongest
oxidising agent, Cu2+(aq) and
strongest reducing agent, Fe(s),
use the electrochemical series
to write the equations for each
species, remembering to reverse the
oxidation reaction, being the lower
of the two.
c Reduction: Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Oxidation: Fe(s) → Fe2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 4 Substitute the values straight into
the following equation from the
electrochemical series.
d E 0
cell = E 0
Reduction reaction – E 0
Oxidation reaction
E 0
cell = +0.34 – (–0.44) = +0.78 volts
Step 5 Write your explanation of what
you would expect, given the cell
potential.
e At the cathode:
Initially copper ions, Cu2+(aq) would be reduced to solid
copper, Cu(s). This would appear as a thin coating on
the surface of the platinum electrode. The mass of the
electrode would be increasing. Over time, all the copper
ions may react. At this point, the next strongest oxidising
agent present in the half-cell solution would be nickel
ions, Ni2+(aq), which would be reduced to solid nickel,
Ni(s). This would create another thin layer on the platinum
electrode, over the top of the copper layer and would result
in a further increase in mass of the electrode. During this
time, the cell potential would be reduced to +0.19 volts.
E 0
cell = –0.25 – (–0.44) = +0.19 volts
Once all of the nickel ions have reacted, the reaction would cease to produce any electrical energy since the
remaining ions at the cathode are zinc ions, Zn2+(aq), and these occur lower on the electrochemical series
than the strongest reducing agent, which is still Fe(s).

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can explain the role and importance of separating half-cells in galvanic cells
CODE: 3C.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
Separated half-cells prevent direct contact between oxidising and reducing agents, forcing electrons to travel through the external circuit rather than transferring directly, converting chemical energy to electrical energy instead of heat.

WHY (importance):
Without separation, spontaneous exothermic reactions release energy as heat (as when zinc is placed directly in copper sulfate), making the energy unusable for electrical devices.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
When Zn(s) is placed directly in Cu2+(aq) solution, heat is produced. When separated in a galvanic cell, the same reaction produces 1.10 volts of electrical energy to power devices.

SUBTOPIC: Galvanic Cell Features
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic examines the design features of galvanic cells, including the roles of separated half-cells, electrodes, salt bridges, and electrolytes. It covers how these components work together to convert chemical energy from spontaneous redox reactions into usable electrical energy.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding galvanic cell design is essential for battery technology, fuel cells, and electrochemical applications. These principles explain how batteries work, why certain designs are chosen, and how to optimize cell performance for different applications.

TOPIC: Galvanic Cells
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Study of redox reactions, oxidation numbers, and electrochemical cells that convert chemical energy to electrical energy. Includes writing balanced half-equations, understanding galvanic cell design, and using the electrochemical series to predict reactions and calculate cell potentials.

What is oxidation?
You have likely heard of reduction and oxidation from your study of chemistry.
However, where did these terms come from, and when and how were redox reactions
first discovered?
The terms ‘reduction’ and ‘oxidation’ stem from the historical exploration of
combustion, which was the first type of oxidation studied. In 1775, English scientist,
Joseph Priestley, who had discovered oxygen about a year earlier, met with French
chemist, Antoine Lavoisier, who went on to revolutionise the field of chemistry by
investigating the role of oxygen in combustion reactions. Lavoisier’s work helped to
later establish that combustion reactions involved materials combining with oxygen,
and these reactions were classified as oxidation reactions. Alternatively, those reactions
where oxygen was produced were classified as reduction reactions.
Often, when oxygen is involved in a reaction, it will be acting as an oxidising agent.
However, this is not always the case; but when redox reactions were first discovered by
Priestley and Lavoisier, they believed that oxygen was always involved, which is another
reason why the term ‘oxidation’ was adopted.
Figure 3A–1 French chemist Antoine Lavoisier revolutionised the field of
chemistry with his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion reactions.

EXPLAIN
Most of the material in the following two sections is also covered in Units 1 and 2. However,
it is also assessable in Units 3 and 4, hence its inclusion. Where possible, questions and
examples have been altered. However, please note that in Section 3B, new material has
been added in order to cover redox reactions under basic conditions. This was not required
learning for the Units 1 and 2 course and is potentially examinable content.
What is redox?
The word redox is a combined abbreviation for reduction and oxidation, which are two
different processes that occur simultaneously during a redox reaction. A redox reaction
involves an electron transfer from one chemical species to another.
Therefore, reduction can be defined as the gain of electrons and oxidation as the loss of
electrons. A nice way to remember this is using the mnemonic OILRIG – Oxidation Is Loss
(of electrons), Reduction Is Gain (of electrons).

NOTE
There is also a ‘rule of thumb’, most often used by organic chemists, which identifies a species in
a reaction as being oxidised due to a gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen, or being reduced due to
a loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen. Note, however, that redox reactions do not always involve
hydrogen or oxygen.
The reaction between solid magnesium ribbon and oxygen gas, if performed at high
temperatures, produces solid magnesium oxide. The redox equation for this reaction can
be written as

Reducing agents and oxidising agents
You should recall that ionic compounds are formed when there is a large difference in the
electronegativities of the bonding atoms. This commonly occurs between a non-metal
and a group 1 metal, a group 2 metal or a transition metal with a low oxidation number.
In a similar way, the redox reaction between magnesium and oxygen involves a transfer
of electrons from the magnesium atoms to the oxygen atoms. Given that oxidation is
the loss of electrons, in this reaction magnesium has undergone oxidation; it has been
oxidised. Similarly, the oxygen has undergone reduction; it has been reduced, since it is
the molecule that gained the electrons.

It is also useful to identify the reducing agent and the oxidising agent in a reaction. The
species that causes oxidation of the other reactant (species) is termed the oxidising agent.
The species that causes reduction to occur to the other species is termed the reducing agent.
In the example on the previous page, magnesium causes the reduction of oxygen gas and
at the same time undergoes oxidation itself, losing electrons. Thus, magnesium can be
identified as the reducing agent in this reaction. Similarly, oxygen causes the oxidation
of magnesium and at the same time undergoes reduction itself, gaining electrons. Thus,
oxygen can be identified as the oxidising agent in this reaction.

NUMBERS
Oxidation numbers
It is not always easy to identify whether electrons are being transferred or not in a chemical
reaction, nor is it obvious which species is gaining or losing them. To help identify whether
a species is gaining or losing electrons and consequently whether it is undergoing reduction
or oxidation, we can use oxidation numbers.
Writing oxidation numbers
While not official IUPAC convention, oxidation numbers are easily represented when
written directly above the element as –1, 0, +1, +2 and so on. It is important to distinguish
between this format and that of an ion. For example, the magnesium ion, Mg2+, has an ionic
charge of 2+, but its oxidation number is written as +2, usually like this:
+2 Oxidation number
Mg
2+
Assigning oxidation numbers
You can work out the oxidation number of an unknown element by applying several rules
to identify the oxidation numbers in other elements present in a species. Although many
elements will often have the same oxidation number, some elements can have multiple
oxidation numbers. One example of this is nitrogen, which can have oxidation numbers
ranging from –3 to +5!
The rules to follow when assigning oxidation numbers, as well as exceptions to some rules
that are particularly important to remember, are summarised in Table 3A–1.

Table 3A–1 Oxidation numbers rules and examples
Category Rule Example(s)
Free elements
Oxidation number = 0 (zero)
A free element is any element that
exists on its own and that is not a
charged ion. It may be monoatomic
or polyatomic but must contain only
one type of element.
Solid iron metal, Fe(s)
Hydrogen gas, H2(g)
Oxygen gas, O2(g)
Sulfur, S8(s)
Carbon, C(s)
Hydrogen
Typical oxidation
number = +1
Alternative oxidation
number = –1
The alternative oxidation number
only occurs when hydrogen is
part of a metal hydride. This is
because metal hydrides are ionic
compounds, and as such, the metal
ion will have an oxidation number
equal to its charge. To achieve an
overall neutral charge for metal
hydrides, hydrogen must have an
oxidation number of –1.
Methane, CH4
In this neutral molecule, hydrogen will
have its typical oxidation number of +1.
Exception: Sodium hydride, NaH.
In this case, the sodium ion will have an
oxidation number of +1, and the hydrogen
will have an oxidation number of –1.
Oxygen
Typical oxidation
number = –2
Alternative oxidation
number = –1
Oxygen will typically have an
oxidation number of –2 when it is
not a free element. The alternative
oxidation number occurs only when
oxygen is part of a peroxide, such as
hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
Carbon dioxide, CO2
In this neutral molecule, oxygen will have
an oxidation number of –2.
Exception: Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
In this molecule, hydrogen will have an
oxidation number of +1, and oxygen will
have an oxidation number of –1.
Pure ions
Oxidation number = ionic
charge
Pure ions have an oxidation number
equal to their ionic charge.
Aluminium ions, Al3+
These ions will have an ionic charge of 3+
and an oxidation number of +3.
Neutral compounds
The sum of the oxidation
numbers will be 0 (zero).
Neutral compounds, as well as
having an overall neutral charge,
will also be neutral in their overall
oxidation number total.
Water, H2O
In the neutral molecule of water, hydrogen
has an oxidation number of +1 and oxygen
has an oxidation number of –2. There are
two hydrogen atoms, so overall:
(2 × +1) + (–2) = 0.
Polyatomic ions
The sum of the oxidation
numbers = charge on
the ion
Polyatomic ions have an overall
oxidation number equal to the
charge on the polyatomic ion.
Sulfate ions, SO4
2–
These polyatomic ions have an overall
ionic charge of 2–. Oxygen has an
oxidation number of –2, and there are four
atoms of oxygen, so 4 × –2 = –8. Sulfur
must have an oxidation number of +6, to
match the overall charge on the ion.
–8 + (+6) = –2.
NOTE
The most electronegative element in a compound must be assigned a negative oxidation number.
Therefore, fluorine, being the most electronegative element, will always have an oxidation
number of –1. There are no exceptions to this scenario. More generally, group 17 halogens usually
have an oxidation number of –1, but not always. Chlorine, in some cases, can have a positive
oxidation number. An example of this is chlorine dioxide, ClO2, where chlorine has an oxidation
number of +4 because oxygen is more electronegative than chlorine and hence is assigned the
oxidation number of –2.

Using oxidation numbers
Identifying reducing agents and oxidising agents
A change in oxidation number of an element can be used to identify reducing agents and
oxidising agents. If the oxidation number increases for an element during a reaction, it
indicates that it has undergone oxidation, losing electrons (hence becoming ‘more positive’)
and is therefore called the reducing agent. Similarly, if the oxidation number decreases for
an element during a reaction, it indicates that it has undergone reduction, gaining electrons
(hence becoming ‘less positive’) and is therefore identified as the oxidising agent.
+2 0
Fe2+(aq) + 2e– Fe(s)
In the equation shown above, Fe2+(aq) ions are reduced because the oxidation number of
iron decreases from +2 to 0. Fe(s) has gained electrons.

In half-equations such as this, an alternative way to determine whether reduction or
oxidation is taking place is to identify on which side of the equation the electrons are
present. If electrons are on the left-hand side, as shown in Figure 3A–2, then it is a
reduction half-equation. If electrons are on the right-hand side, then it is an oxidation
half-equation.

Solution

Step 2 Assign oxidation numbers

0 0
Pb2+(aq) + Zn(s) Pb(s) + Zn2+(aq)
Step 3 Answer the question
by using the change in
oxidation numbers of the
atoms/ions.
Pb2+(aq) ions have been reduced since the
oxidation number decreases from +2 to 0.
Zn(s) has been oxidised to Zn2+(aq) ions because
its oxidation number has increased from 0 to +2.
Zn(s) can be identified as the reducing agent, and
Pb2+(aq) ions are therefore the oxidising agent.
Important considerations when using oxidation numbers
In many redox reactions, the same elements are often involved as reactants and as
products. It is particularly important to note the difference in states and charges when
you are describing changes in a redox reaction or when you are asked to identify reducing
agents or oxidising agents. For example, copper ions, Cu2+(aq), are a different chemical
species compared to copper solid, Cu(s).
In addition, where the element whose oxidation number changes during a redox reaction
belongs to a polyatomic species, you should include the entire reactant compound that
contains the element when naming the reducing agent or oxidising agent. Consider

Step 3 Answer the question
by using the change

Iron, Fe, shows an oxidation number change from +3 to
0, meaning that it has been reduced (gained electrons).
However, if you were stating the oxidising agent, you
would state iron oxide, Fe2O3(s), as this is the chemical
species causing the oxidation of the carbon monoxide.
Similarly, the reducing agent for this reaction would be
identified as carbon monoxide, CO(g), even though only
the carbon undergoes an oxidation number increase
(due to oxidation, loss of electrons).

Identifying redox couples
During a redox reaction, the species acting as a reducing agent on the reactant side donates
(loses) electrons and in doing so forms a product that is an oxidising agent. At the same
time, the reactant acting as the oxidising agent is converted into a product that is a reducing
agent. The association of each reactant and the product it forms during a redox reaction is
referred to as a redox couple.
For example, when copper metal undergoes oxidation, losing electrons, the copper ions
produced could act as an oxidising agent, gaining electrons.
Redox couple
Cu(s) Cu2+(aq) + 2e–

In a similar way, when zinc ions undergo reduction to zinc solid, the zinc solid could then

3A REDUCTION AND OXIDATION

Your ability to identify redox couples will be equally important in the next section of this
chapter when you explore how to write half-equations from full redox equations. In most
cases, you will be required to identify redox couples in full redox reactions rather than in
half-equations. Each redox reaction will therefore have two redox couples.
To identify a redox couple, the following are required:
1 There must be one species on the reactant side and one species on the product side of
the equation containing the same element.
2 There must be a change in oxidation number.
Figure 3A–3 shows that copper has an oxidation number of +2 in copper oxide, CuO, on
the reactant side, which decreases to 0 in copper (solid) on the product side. This is the
first redox couple. In a similar way, the hydrogen gas and water can be identified as the
second redox couple, where hydrogen shows an increase in oxidation number from
0 to +1.

during a redox reaction, it means that element is not undergoing reduction or oxidation.

What conditions are needed for redox reactions?
What conditions are needed for a redox reaction to take place? Do they even matter?
Redox reactions can take place in a range of conditions, including neutral, basic or acidic
conditions. These conditions do have some influence over what species are involved
during a redox reaction and are important to consider when writing balanced equations
for a given scenario.
In basic conditions, the OH– ions play a role in the redox reactions that can take place.
You might already be familiar with alkaline batteries; these are examples of redox
reactions taking place in basic conditions. Car batteries, on the other hand, are an
example of redox reactions taking place in acidic conditions. You will learn more about
batteries and cells and their conditions in Section 3C.

Writing redox half-equations
Simple half-equations
You should recall that redox reactions involve both reduction and oxidation. As you have
already seen in Section 3A, reduction and oxidation reactions can be written as separate
half-equations, which show the electrons either as reactants in reduction half-equations or
as products in oxidation half-equations. These are referred to as simple half-equations.

3B WRITING REDOX EQUATIONS
89
When writing simple half-equations, which contain only one type of element, there are a
few steps that you need to follow. Applying the acronym ECS will help you to remember
these three critical steps.
1 Write the species on the correct side of the equation and then balance the Element
involved.
2 Balance the Charges in the equation. This is done by adding the appropriate number of
electrons to the more positive side of the half-equation. Note that you can apply your
understanding of oxidation numbers to each element in an equation to determine this.
3 Finally, ensure that you have included correct States for each element listed.
NOTE
When assigning states for redox equations in this course, note the following points.
1 Ions are always aqueous, (aq).
2 Electrons have no state.
3 Water, H2O, is always liquid, (l).

Balancing in basic conditions
Balancing redox reactions in basic, or alkaline, conditions is slightly more complicated than
the steps involved for acidic conditions. The main reason is that each redox half-equation will
have both hydrogen ions, H+
, and hydroxide ions, OH–, added to it. These ions then combine
to make water, so there is some additional cancelling that takes place. We can still use the
KOHES method, but remember to include the two additional steps, which are shown below.
Step Explanation

3B WRITING REDOX EQUATIONS
93
Combining half-equations
You should recall that redox reactions involve a transfer of electrons, where reduction and
oxidation both occur simultaneously. That is, you can’t have one without the other, and the
number of electrons that the oxidising agent gains, must be equal to the number of electrons
that the reducing agent loses. When considering half-equations, this means that the number
of electrons on the left-hand side of a reduction half-equation must be equal to the number
of electrons on the right-hand side of the corresponding oxidation half-equation.
In situations where the number of electrons differ in each half-equation, you must find the
lowest common multiple for the number of electrons. Do this by multiplying one or both
half-equations to ensure that the numbers of electrons are equal to this lowest common
multiple value. The half-equations can then be added or combined to give the full, overall
redox equation. Worked example 3B–5 shows you how to do this.
VIDEO

EXAMPLE 3B–5
Worked example 3B–5: Combining redox half-equations
Write the combined redox equation for the reaction between silver ions and nickel metal.
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write each of the balanced half-equations
that take place.
Process
Ag+(aq) + e–
→ Ag(s)
Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 2 Balance the electrons in each equation by
finding the lowest common multiple.
The silver half-equation only has one
electron, whereas the nickel half-equation
contains two electrons.
To balance the electrons, we need to multiply
the silver half-equation by 2.
2 × (Ag+(aq) + e–
2Ag+(aq) + 2e–
→ Ag(s))
→ 2Ag(s)
Step 3 Combine the half-equations by adding them
together. A simple way of doing this is to write
each species that is on the left of the arrow
of the half-equations together on the left and
write each species that is on the right of the
arrow of the half-equations together on the
right.
Note that it is important to place the arrows
directly below each other.
2Ag+(aq) + 2e–
→ 2Ag(s)
Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
_________________________________________
2Ag+(aq) + 2e– + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 4 The electrons on the left-hand side of the
arrow cancel out those on the right-hand
side, leaving the full balanced redox equation.
2Ag+(aq) + 2e– + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
_________________________________________
2Ag+(aq) + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq)

Writing balanced half-equations from full redox reactions
Sometimes you may be given an ionic equation, or full redox equation, from which you

follow the steps to balance each half-equation that were covered in Worked examples 3B–1,
3B–2 and 3B–3.

NOTE
There is sometimes a rare case where the reduction and oxidation reactions both result in the
same product being formed. An example of this is shown below.
Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 4H+(aq) + 2SO4
2–(aq) → 2PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(l)
The redox couples for such a reaction would each have the same product as indicated below.
Pb + PbO2 + 4H+ + 2SO4

Sometimes it is possible for the opposite to happen, where the same species in a redox reaction
acts as both the reducing agent and the oxidising agent. In one half-reaction it would undergo
reduction, and in the other half-reaction it would undergo oxidation. These are uncommon
circumstances but are important to be aware of.

BALANCED
EQUATIONS
Key things to check when writing balanced equations
It is important that you are able to write balanced equations, particularly in this section
of the course. Below are a few points to remember that you may find helpful.
1 Never change the subscripted numbers in a formula. This is only done when balancing
the formula of ionic compounds based on the individual charges of the cation and the
anion.
2 Only ever change coeﬃcients to balance elements.
3 A balanced equation must have the same number of each element on both the
reactant and product sides.
4 Charges on both the reactant and product sides must always be the same. One
common mistake is adding electrons to each side of a redox equation to make the
charges equal zero on both sides. Sometimes the charges will be zero, other times
positive or negative. They simply need to be the same on each side.
5 Finally, always make sure that you add states to any equations you write.
Let’s look at an example to apply these rules.

96 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
In the 1840s, a telegraph system used an early version of an electric primary cell that
consisted of two half-cells, each with an electrode and an aqueous electrolyte, which
were:
• a zinc electrode (Zn) in dilute sulfuric acid solution (H2SO4).
• a platinum electrode (Pt) in concentrated nitric acid (HNO3).
In the nitric acid half-cell, aqueous nitrate ions, NO3
–, were converted into nitrogen
dioxide, NO2.
Write the half-equation for this reaction by following these steps.
1 Write the initial reactant and products without changing the subscripts present
NO3
–

2 Balance the elements by following the steps in KOHES, which will change the
coeﬃcients.
NO3
– + 2H+ ⇌ NO2 + H2O
3 Check that the same number of elements is present on both the reactant and product
sides of the equation – which they are.
4 The reactant side of the equation has an overall charge of +1 (–1 + 2), whereas the
product side of the equation has an overall charge of 0. Therefore, balance the charges
by adding electrons to the more positive side, in this case the reactant side (one
electron needed).

Batteries are everywhere!
In a world where technology is advancing and
the number of portable and mobile gadgets
is increasing, have you ever wondered when
batteries were first invented, or what is it about
a battery that makes it possible to provide the
electrical energy to power these devices?
There are many different types of batteries in
use today. Some larger batteries store huge
amounts of power generated by solar farms,
others may be used to power electric cars, while
many are much smaller and can be found in
Figure 3C–1 Italian scientist Alessandro
Volta and his voltaic pile ‘battery’
consisting of alternating silver and
zinc discs
watches and hearing aids. Despite their size
differences, essentially all of them have a similar design enabling a redox chemical
reaction to take place that converts stored chemical energy into usable electrical energy.
American scientist and inventor, Benjamin Franklin, first used the term ‘battery’ in
the mid-1700s but it is believed that the first true battery was made by Italian scientist
Alessandro Volta in 1800. He created a stack of alternating discs of silver and zinc,
separated by cloth soaked in salt water, to generate a current. Since there were
no instruments available to detect weak currents at the time, he tested his batteries by
using his tongue! Volta discovered that changing the types of metals used, as well as
changing the number of discs, had an effect on the amount of current that the battery
could produce.
Another battery that you might already be familiar with is the lead–acid battery, which
was invented in the mid-1800s. It was the first-ever rechargeable battery and is still
commonly used today to provide the electrical energy needed to start cars and other
vehicles. Batteries are examples of galvanic cells, which are central to this section of the
Study Design.

3C FEATURES OF GALVANIC CELLS

EXPLAIN
Electrochemical cells
Electrochemical cells are systems that can convert stored chemical energy into electrical
energy or that can use electrical energy supplied to facilitate chemical reactions. Some can
even do both! In this chapter, we will focus on the former, also referred to as ‘galvanic cells’.
Galvanic cells are one type of electrochemical cell and involve spontaneous redox reactions.
NOTE
It is helpful to recognise that there are a number of interchangeable terms used when discussing
galvanic cells: ‘voltaic cell’, ‘primary cell’ and even the term ‘battery’ may all be used to reference
a galvanic cell. Essentially, they are equivalent in that they refer to an electrochemical cell that
spontaneously produces electrical energy from chemical energy.

Figure 3C–2 shows the spontaneous
redox reaction that occurs when solid
zinc metal, Zn(s), is placed directly
into a solution of copper(II) sulfate
containing copper ions, Cu2+(aq).
The overall redox reaction for this
process is:
Cu2+(aq) + Zn(s) → Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq)
Since the reactants are in direct
contact with each other, when the
reaction takes place, electrons are
exchanged directly in an exothermic
reaction, and chemical energy is
converted into thermal energy, which
is released into the surroundings
as heat.

energy, galvanic cells are systems
that separate the two reactants instead of allowing them to be in direct contact with one
another. This allows for the transformation of chemical energy into electrical energy that
can be harnessed and used to provide power. Without this separation, a spontaneous
exothermic reaction would still occur, involving a direct exchange of electrons between
the reactants. This would produce heat energy instead of the electrical energy that can be
generated by a galvanic cell.

Features of galvanic cells
Galvanic cells are designed with a number of important features to ensure that electrical
energy can be produced. Figure 3C–3 shows a representation of a specific galvanic cell
called the Daniell cell, which was one of the first galvanic cells, invented by English
chemist John Daniell in 1836. It includes many of the essential features common to all
galvanic cells and is simple enough that you can reproduce it in the laboratory.

chemist, John Daniell
Half-cells
Galvanic cells are comprised of two half-cells, which must be separated in order to produce
electrical energy. In Figure 3C–3 above, the Daniell cell has two beakers separating the
reactants. Each half-cell contains a solid conducting electrode partially submerged in a
solution of ions. It is on the surface of these electrodes where the reduction and oxidation
reactions take place. From Section 3A, we know that reduction involves a ‘gain’ of electrons,
while oxidation involves the production or ‘loss’ of electrons. In a galvanic cell, the
electrode where reduction occurs is called the cathode, which is also the positive terminal of
the cell. The electrode where oxidation occurs is called the anode, which in a galvanic cell is
also the negative terminal of the cell. The positive or negative ‘charge’ on these electrodes is
more accurately referred to as the electrode polarity.
Electrodes
In Figure 3C–4, solid zinc, Zn(s), is acting as the anode in the oxidation half-cell, which
also contains a solution of zinc ions, Zn2+(aq). Solid copper, Cu(s), is the cathode in the
reduction half-cell, which also contains a solution of copper(II) ions, Cu2+(aq). You might
recognise the species in each half-cell as conjugate redox pairs. Each half-cell contains a
reducing agent and a conjugate oxidising agent. In most galvanic cells, a metal is part of
the conjugate redox pair and is therefore often used as an electrode. When this is the case,
the electrodes are reactive and take part in the redox reactions occurring. During such

reactions, it is possible to observe an increase in mass at the cathode, where ions are
converted to solid metal atoms (reduction occurs). Conversely, at the anode, where metal
atoms are converted into ions, it is possible to observe a decrease in the mass of the metal
electrode being used (oxidation occurs).

Sometimes the conjugate redox pair in a half-cell does not include a metal, in which case
an inert electrode, such as graphite or platinum, may be used instead. These materials still
conduct electricity, but importantly, are not involved in the actual half-reactions that take
place on their surfaces. A final point worth noting about electrodes is that some half-
cells involving gases, such as hydrogen, oxygen or chlorine, may even have a special ‘gas
electrode’. Where the gas is a product of the reaction, there needs to be a way for the gas to
escape. If the gas is a reactant, however, it is usually necessary for the gas to be bubbled into
the solution surrounding the electrode. Figure 3C–5 shows an electrochemical cell that uses
these gas electrodes.

102 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
NOTE
Half-cells usually contain the species that react, but it is important to note that it is also possible for
other species that are not involved in the reaction to be present. Sometimes there may be multiple
ions present in a solution, often used to supply the reactive ions to the solution. For example, in the
Daniell cell, the copper ions are supplied by copper(II) sulfate. Sulfate ions, SO4
2– are also present
but would be considered spectator ions as they do not take part in the actual reaction.
Salt bridge
connects the
circuit in a
galvanic cell and
contains ions
that balance the
charges formed
from each
half-cell
Electrolyte
a non-reactive
solution or paste
that enables the
flow of charged
particles
and helps to
facilitate the
redox reactions
The salt bridge
The salt bridge plays three important roles in a galvanic cell:
1 It connects the circuit, allowing for the flow of charged particles through the circuit
2 It allows for the physical separation of half-cells, preventing reactants from coming into
direct contact with each other
3 It is usually soaked in a non-reactive electrolyte solution consisting of cations and anions
that can migrate into the solutions to balance the charges of the reaction occurring in
each half-cell (as shown in Figure 3C–4 with Na+ and Cl– ions).
Without a salt bridge, charge would accumulate in each of the cells and the redox reaction
would soon cease.
Two common electrolytes used in galvanic cells are concentrated potassium nitrate, KNO3,
and concentrated potassium chloride, KCl; however, other substances may also be used,
including sodium sulfate, Na2SO4, and sodium chloride, NaCl. Often the salt bridge is
simply a piece of filter paper soaked in the electrolyte and draped across the two solutions
in each beaker.
Migration of ions from the salt bridge
Consider the redox reactions taking place in the Daniell cell shown in Figure 3C–4.
Reduction at the cathode: Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Oxidation at the anode: Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e–
If we focus on the reduction reaction, we can see that it is using positive cations from the
solution and converting them to neutral solid metal atoms. As a result, those cations are
essentially removed from the solution as they take part in the reaction, so there would start
to be an imbalance between the cations and anions in the solution. To balance the charges,
positively charged cations from the salt bridge migrate into the solution of the reduction
half-cell. For example, if NaCl is the electrolyte solution being used in the cell, it would
be sodium ions, Na+, that migrate towards the cathode. It is important to note that this
‘balancing’ of charge is happening in real-time and that if it did not, the galvanic cell would
cease to function.
Looking at the anode reaction, the opposite is occurring, as solid zinc metal atoms are
oxidised to zinc ions, Zn2+. In this half-cell, the balance of charge in the solution would
start to shift to have more cations than anions, so to balance this change, negatively charged
anions migrate from the salt bridge towards the anode. If NaCl is the electrolyte solution
being used in the cell, it would mean chloride ions, Cl–, perform this function.

3C FEATURES OF GALVANIC CELLS
103
NOTE
An easy way to remember this movement of ions in the electrolyte (salt) bridge is:
– anions to the anode
– cations to the cathode.
As well as observing a change in mass at the cathode and anode, sometimes other
important observations can be made that provide some indication that a reaction is taking
place within a galvanic cell. In some half-cells, gases may be produced in a half-reaction
that result in bubbles forming on the surface of the electrode. Another observation might
be a change in appearance of the solvent used in a half-cell. For example, in the Daniell cell,
the copper(II) sulfate solution has a blue colour. However, as the reaction proceeds and
copper ions in that solution undergo reduction, the concentration of copper ions, Cu2+, will
decrease and the intensity of that blue coloured solution will also decrease over time.
The external circuit
The separation of reactants in a galvanic cell is crucial and allows the electrons produced
by oxidation at the anode to flow to the cathode where they then take part in the reduction
reaction. It is important to recognise that the electrons do not move into the solutions.
Instead, the electrons flow from one electrode to the other via the external circuit, which is
made up of wires connecting the electrodes. In some cell diagrams you may see light globes
used in place of the voltmeter shown in Figure 3C–3 or 3C–4, which would glow when
current flows through the external circuit.

measuring

potential
NOTE
An important skill is to determine the direction of flow of electrons. Although it should be
possible to work out the direction by looking at the half-equations to see where the electrons
are being used and where they are being produced, another convenient way to remember the
direction is that they travel from the anode to the cathode (A to the C), which is in alphabetical
order.

104 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Drawing and labelling galvanic cell diagrams
A key skill is being able to use the information about a reaction taking place in a galvanic
cell to draw and/or label key aspects of the cell. This might include:
• writing the half-reactions or overall reaction occurring in the cell
• labelling the anode and cathode
• labelling the polarity of the electrodes
• labelling the direction of electron flow
• labelling the direction of flow of ions from the salt bridge.
Being able to determine many of these characteristics relies on identifying the cathode and
the anode. To assist with this, make use of the galvanic cell mnemonic (memory aid): the
Happy Red Cat.
• Happy corresponds to the positive terminal.
• Red corresponds to reduction.
• Cat corresponds to cathode.
In galvanic cells, these three aspects always combine in the reduction half-cell, so you only
need to identify one of the three aspects to quickly work out the other two. The opposite
holds true for the oxidation half-cell: negative, oxidation and anode.

Solution
Step 1 Logic There is no specific order in which to
approach a question like this, but the
key is to identify what information you
are given and to then try to apply the
‘happy red cat’ mnemonic.
By identifying the reactions shown
for each half-cell, and applying what
we already understand about redox
reactions, we can see the equation
on the left for zinc is producing two
electrons. Therefore, ‘E’ is oxidation.
We can also see that in the half-
reaction on the right the copper ions
are combining with two electrons,
which means that ‘I’ is reduction.
Process
Loss of electrons:
Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e–
Therefore, ‘E’ is oxidation.
Gain of electrons:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Therefore, ‘I’ is reduction.

106 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Step 2 We can then apply the ‘happy red cat’
to labels F and G.
Happy red cat:
Happy: positive
Red: reduction, which occurs on the
right-hand side.
Cat: cathode must also be on the
right-hand side.
Therefore, ‘F’ is cathode and ‘G’ is
positive.
Step 3 By elimination, this tells us which
terms correspond to labels B and C.
If ‘F’ is the cathode, ‘B’ is the anode
and ‘C’ is negative.
Step 4 The direction of electron flow can now
be determined, as we know electrons
flow from anode to the cathode (A to
the C).
Electrons flow from left to right in
this cell, so an arrow pointing right is
appropriate for ‘A’ on the diagram.
Step 5 For ion flow, we know that anions flow
to the anode and cations flow to the
cathode.
Because KNO3 is shown as the
electrolyte solution, the anions would
be nitrate ions, NO3
–, and the cations
would be potassium ions, K+. We can
now add these species to labels D and
H respectively.
Step 6 Complete the diagram. See below.

EXPLAIN
Potential difference
Under the same conditions, the type of reactants being used will influence the amount of
voltage that can be produced by a galvanic cell. The voltage produced is caused by the potential
difference in the amount of energy that the valence electrons have in atoms of different
elements. Electrons flow through the external circuit because of this difference in potential
energy between the two electrodes. More simply, the reactant in one half-cell has a stronger
tendency to move electrons through the circuit compared to the other half-cell. The greater
the difference between the two reactants, the greater the potential voltage the cell will be.

Figure 3D–1 Two similar galvanic cells. The voltage produced in the Daniell cell on the
left is 1.10 volts compared to the cell on the right, which can produce 2.62 volts under
the same conditions. In the cell on the right, the zinc half-cell has been replaced with a
magnesium half-cell.
On the Daniell cell represented in Figure 3D–1, on the left-hand side, the voltmeter measuring
the flow of electric current moving between the two half-cells shows that 1.10 volts is being
produced. In the cell shown on the right-hand side, the zinc half-cell has been substituted with
a magnesium half-cell. Under the same conditions, the second cell is able to produce 2.62 volts.
This difference is due to magnesium being more reactive and having a greater tendency to
move electrons through the external circuit compared to the zinc half-cell.
Standard electrode potential
Each half-cell has a unique standard electrode potential, which is the amount of voltage it
can produce at standard conditions. For these experiments, standard conditions refers to
a temperature of 25°C (298 K), solvent concentrations of 1 M and a pressure of 100 kPa.
As redox reactions involve both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously, it
is not possible to measure the electrode potential of one half-cell without connecting it
to another. Reduction occurs in one half-cell, while oxidation occurs simultaneously in
the other. For this reason, a standard hydrogen electrode has been used to determine the
comparative electrode potentials of other half-reactions – this is then referred to as their
standard electrode potentials.
The standard hydrogen electrode
The value of the standard electrode potential for different half-cells has been experimentally
determined using the standard hydrogen electrode as a reference. To develop the scale,
this half-cell was arbitrarily assigned an electrode potential of 0.00 volts under standard
conditions. Other half-cells were then measured against the standard hydrogen electrode to

half-reaction listed highest on the electrochemical series. However, at the anode, oxidation
is taking place, not reduction, so this half-reaction must be reversed. Whenever a reaction
is reversed, the sign for the value of the standard electrode potential must also be reversed.
The oxidation reaction will be the one listed lowest on the electrochemical series, as shown:

FEATURES OF
ELECTROLYTIC
CELLS
LINK
To determine the overall cell potential, or voltage, that can be produced by the zinc–nickel
cell from page 112 under standard conditions, simply add the two standard electrode
potentials together:
–0.25 + (+0.76) = +0.51 volts
A positive value obtained for the cell potential indicates that the reaction is spontaneous,
which is expected in a galvanic cell. This is useful to remember when performing
calculations of cell potentials. A negative value would mean that the electrochemical cell is
an electrolytic cell, not a galvanic cell. Electrolytic cells are covered further in Section 7A.
NOTE
The values should only be added together if the half-equation and standard electrode potentials
are reversed for the anode half-reaction.
A useful way to calculate the cell potential directly from the electrochemical series, without
reversing equations and values, is to use the following rule:
E 0
cell = E 0
Reduction reaction – E 0
Oxidation reaction
In Figure 3D–3, notice that the reduction half-equation for nickel appears higher up in the
electrochemical series, compared to the oxidation reaction for zinc. This will be true for
ALL galvanic cells. This is another alternative way to remember which electrode potential
should be subtracted from the other when calculating cell potentials in galvanic cells, as in
the following rule:
E 0
cell = E 0
Higher half-reaction – E 0
Lower half-reaction
NOTE
As well as stressing the importance of always including units, it is essential to note that the value
for cell potential is directional, and the positive or negative sign must always be written in front
of the value to indicate this.

Predicting redox reactions in galvanic cells
The electrochemical series can be used to help identify whether a reaction will occur
spontaneously. For a reaction to occur, the oxidising agent must be located higher on the
left-hand side of the series, compared to the reducing agent, which must be located lower
and on the right-hand side of the series. If the species are not positioned in this way, no
reaction will occur.

Solution
a Pb2+(aq) is the oxidising agent, as it is the species highest on the left-hand side and
Cd(s) is the reducing agent, as it is located lower on the right-hand side. As such they
will undergo a spontaneous reaction.
b No reaction will occur, since both species are oxidising agents and are both located
on the left-hand side of the electrochemical series.
c No reaction will occur, since Ni2+(aq), as the oxidising agent on the left-hand side is
lower than Pb2+(aq), which is the reducing agent, located higher on the right-hand side.
Identifying reactions using the
electrochemical series
The half-equations occurring in a galvanic cell are
not always provided. However, if all the species
present are known, the electrochemical series can
be used to identify the half-reactions occurring, to
then determine the overall redox reaction and to
calculate the cell potential for a given combination
of reactants. On the electrochemical series, the
species that is highest on the left-hand side of the
electrochemical series will undergo reduction.
The species that is lowest on the right-hand side
will undergo oxidation, meaning the reaction on
the electrochemical series for this half-reaction
must be written in reverse.

Step 3 Write the equations for reduction and
oxidation, remembering to reverse
the oxidation reaction, which is the
lower of the two. It is important to
note the use of correct arrows when
writing these half-equations. The
electrochemical series represents
each reduction half-equation with
equilibrium arrows because it can be
reversed, depending on what else it is
reacting with. However, when writing
half-equations for a particular cell, a
critical part of what we are predicting is
the direction in which these reactions
will occur, and hence the use of a solid
forward arrow is appropriate.
b Ag+(aq) + e–
E 0 = +0.80
→ Ag(s)
Pb(s) → Pb2+(aq) + 2e–
E 0 = +0.13
Step 4 To determine the cell potential, the
values in Step 3 can be added,
since the oxidation reaction and its
standard electrode potential have
been reversed.
Alternatively, the values can be
substituted straight into the following
equation from the electrochemical
series.
c +0.80 + (+0.13) = +0.93 volts
E 0
cell = E 0
Reduction reaction – E 0
Oxidation reaction
E 0
cell = +0.80 – (–0.13) = +0.93 volts
Step 5 Write the overall equation by
balancing electrons and combining
the half-equations. In this example,
there are two electrons in the oxidation
half-equation but only one electron
in the reduction half-equation, which
consequently needs to be doubled.
Now that the number of electrons is
the same on each side, the electrons
can be cancelled to leave the full
redox equation.

2Ag+(aq) + 2e–

Step 6 Add the cell potential value to the
overall equation, making sure to
include units (volts).

The standard electrode potential indicates the potential for a reaction to occur – it is never
multiplied when calculating cell potentials.

Limitations of the electrochemical series
Recall that the electrochemical series was derived using standard laboratory conditions. This
means that unpredictable things may occur when a galvanic cell is placed under conditions
that vary significantly from SLC. Sometimes a different reaction may take place, or there may
in fact be no reaction at all, even if a reaction is predicted to occur spontaneously. Changing
the temperature from 25°C or using solutions that have a concentration different to 1 M, may
result in different reactions taking place. The increased concentration of one particular ion
may mean that it reacts instead of the ions predicted on the electrochemical series. This can
be seen when the electrode potential values, E0, are close together.
One final consideration is that the electrochemical series does not provide any indication
of the reaction rate. Sometimes reactions may be predicted to occur, but they may do so
very slowly. Sometimes reactions may be taking place at such a slow rate that they appear
not to react, even though the electrochemical series predicts that a reaction is taking place.
For example, observing a galvanic cell for 20 minutes may not be sufficient time to observe
products of reactions being formed or other changes expected in the half-cells. You will
study rates of reaction more in Section 5B.
Sometimes, as well as the same species appearing in multiple positions on the electrochemical
series, some half-reactions may also include multiple species. Two examples of this are
shown below where there are hydrogen ions, H+(aq) shown as part of the half-reaction. This
indicates that for the reaction to proceed, there must also be a suitable supply of hydrogen
ions, which would usually mean using an acidic solution. It is important to consider all species
when predicting whether reactions will occur, but also when predicting what the products of
a particular galvanic cell may be. Measuring pH changes or using acid–base indicators may be
one additional way to detect whether a reaction is taking place.

Predicting reactions with more than one type of ion present
In some galvanic cells, electrodes can be inert, in which case they are not considered
when trying to predict the reactions occurring. Similarly, solutions in each half-cell
may contain more than one type of reactive ion. In such cases, it is important to

REACTIONS WITH
MORE THAN ONE
TYPE OF ION
PRESENT
remember redox reactions will only occur between the strongest oxidising agent in the
reduction half-cell and the strongest reducing agent in the oxidation half-cell. If there are many ion species
present, only two will react, and the rest will be considered to be spectator ions.
Some species appear more than once on the electrochemical series on both the left-hand side and right-
hand side of the series. When predicting reactions, all occurrences of each species must be considered to
accurately identify the strongest reducing agent and strongest oxidising agent.
Further consideration should also be given regarding what would happen in a galvanic cell where one of
these ions is completely used up by the reaction. If one completely reacts, the next strongest species will
start to react, provided there is another species available. There would be a decrease in the amount of
voltage produced, but it is important to recognise that whenever other species are present, the reaction
may not simply ‘stop’.
The example below highlights a type of question where more than one type of ion is present, as well as the
worked solution for this example.
Question
A galvanic cell consists of one half-cell with an inert platinum, Pt(s), electrode in a 1 M solution of

Solution
Logic Process
Step 1 Use the electrochemical series to
highlight all the reactive species
present. It is often useful to highlight
the species present in one half-cell
differently from those in the other.
This can make it easier to identify
the reduction and oxidation
reactions that will take place.
The species highest on the left-hand
side of a reaction arrow will be the
strongest oxidising agent.
The species lowest on the right-
hand side of a reaction arrow will be
the strongest reducing agent.

Step 2 To identify the cathode, apply the
‘happy red cat’. Given that the iron
electrode is the strongest reducing
agent, undergoing oxidation, it
must be the anode. Therefore, the
strongest oxidising agent, copper
ions undergo reduction in the other
half-cell, where platinum is the
electrode, the cathode must be
platinum.
b Anode: Fe(s)
Cathode: Pt(s)
Step 3 Having identified the strongest
oxidising agent, Cu2+(aq) and
strongest reducing agent, Fe(s),
use the electrochemical series
to write the equations for each
species, remembering to reverse the
oxidation reaction, being the lower
of the two.

Step 5 Write your explanation of what
you would expect, given the cell
potential.
e At the cathode:
Initially copper ions, Cu2+(aq) would be reduced to solid
copper, Cu(s). This would appear as a thin coating on
the surface of the platinum electrode. The mass of the
electrode would be increasing. Over time, all the copper
ions may react. At this point, the next strongest oxidising
agent present in the half-cell solution would be nickel
ions, Ni2+(aq), which would be reduced to solid nickel,
Ni(s). This would create another thin layer on the platinum
electrode, over the top of the copper layer and would result
in a further increase in mass of the electrode. During this
time, the cell potential would be reduced to +0.19 volts.
E 0
cell = –0.25 – (–0.44) = +0.19 volts
Once all of the nickel ions have reacted, the reaction would cease to produce any electrical energy since the
remaining ions at the cathode are zinc ions, Zn2+(aq), and these occur lower on the electrochemical series
than the strongest reducing agent, which is still Fe(s).

TARGET: Demonstrate comprehension of concepts.
TEST: Can student explain ideas in their own words or recognise examples?
QUESTION TYPES: Explain concepts, interpret meanings, classify examples, summarise relationships.
STEMS: "Which statement best explains...", "What does X mean...", "An example of X would be...", "Why does..."
AVOID: Direct recall of definitions. Require paraphrasing or recognition in new contexts.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

LEARNING POINT CONTEXT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TITLE: I can explain the role and importance of separating half-cells in galvanic cells
CODE: 3C.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
Separated half-cells prevent direct contact between oxidising and reducing agents, forcing electrons to travel through the external circuit rather than transferring directly, converting chemical energy to electrical energy instead of heat.

WHY (importance):
Without separation, spontaneous exothermic reactions release energy as heat (as when zinc is placed directly in copper sulfate), making the energy unusable for electrical devices.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
When Zn(s) is placed directly in Cu2+(aq) solution, heat is produced. When separated in a galvanic cell, the same reaction produces 1.10 volts of electrical energy to power devices.

SUBTOPIC: Galvanic Cell Features
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic examines the design features of galvanic cells, including the roles of separated half-cells, electrodes, salt bridges, and electrolytes. It covers how these components work together to convert chemical energy from spontaneous redox reactions into usable electrical energy.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding galvanic cell design is essential for battery technology, fuel cells, and electrochemical applications. These principles explain how batteries work, why certain designs are chosen, and how to optimize cell performance for different applications.

TOPIC: Galvanic Cells
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Study of redox reactions, oxidation numbers, and electrochemical cells that convert chemical energy to electrical energy. Includes writing balanced half-equations, understanding galvanic cell design, and using the electrochemical series to predict reactions and calculate cell potentials.

What is oxidation?
You have likely heard of reduction and oxidation from your study of chemistry.
However, where did these terms come from, and when and how were redox reactions
first discovered?
The terms ‘reduction’ and ‘oxidation’ stem from the historical exploration of
combustion, which was the first type of oxidation studied. In 1775, English scientist,
Joseph Priestley, who had discovered oxygen about a year earlier, met with French
chemist, Antoine Lavoisier, who went on to revolutionise the field of chemistry by
investigating the role of oxygen in combustion reactions. Lavoisier’s work helped to
later establish that combustion reactions involved materials combining with oxygen,
and these reactions were classified as oxidation reactions. Alternatively, those reactions
where oxygen was produced were classified as reduction reactions.
Often, when oxygen is involved in a reaction, it will be acting as an oxidising agent.
However, this is not always the case; but when redox reactions were first discovered by
Priestley and Lavoisier, they believed that oxygen was always involved, which is another
reason why the term ‘oxidation’ was adopted.
Figure 3A–1 French chemist Antoine Lavoisier revolutionised the field of
chemistry with his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion reactions.

EXPLAIN
Most of the material in the following two sections is also covered in Units 1 and 2. However,
it is also assessable in Units 3 and 4, hence its inclusion. Where possible, questions and
examples have been altered. However, please note that in Section 3B, new material has
been added in order to cover redox reactions under basic conditions. This was not required
learning for the Units 1 and 2 course and is potentially examinable content.
What is redox?
The word redox is a combined abbreviation for reduction and oxidation, which are two
different processes that occur simultaneously during a redox reaction. A redox reaction
involves an electron transfer from one chemical species to another.
Therefore, reduction can be defined as the gain of electrons and oxidation as the loss of
electrons. A nice way to remember this is using the mnemonic OILRIG – Oxidation Is Loss
(of electrons), Reduction Is Gain (of electrons).

NOTE
There is also a ‘rule of thumb’, most often used by organic chemists, which identifies a species in
a reaction as being oxidised due to a gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen, or being reduced due to
a loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen. Note, however, that redox reactions do not always involve
hydrogen or oxygen.
The reaction between solid magnesium ribbon and oxygen gas, if performed at high
temperatures, produces solid magnesium oxide. The redox equation for this reaction can

Reducing agents and oxidising agents
You should recall that ionic compounds are formed when there is a large difference in the
electronegativities of the bonding atoms. This commonly occurs between a non-metal
and a group 1 metal, a group 2 metal or a transition metal with a low oxidation number.
In a similar way, the redox reaction between magnesium and oxygen involves a transfer
of electrons from the magnesium atoms to the oxygen atoms. Given that oxidation is
the loss of electrons, in this reaction magnesium has undergone oxidation; it has been
oxidised. Similarly, the oxygen has undergone reduction; it has been reduced, since it is
the molecule that gained the electrons.

It is also useful to identify the reducing agent and the oxidising agent in a reaction. The
species that causes oxidation of the other reactant (species) is termed the oxidising agent.
The species that causes reduction to occur to the other species is termed the reducing agent.
In the example on the previous page, magnesium causes the reduction of oxygen gas and
at the same time undergoes oxidation itself, losing electrons. Thus, magnesium can be
identified as the reducing agent in this reaction. Similarly, oxygen causes the oxidation
of magnesium and at the same time undergoes reduction itself, gaining electrons. Thus,
oxygen can be identified as the oxidising agent in this reaction.

NUMBERS
Oxidation numbers
It is not always easy to identify whether electrons are being transferred or not in a chemical
reaction, nor is it obvious which species is gaining or losing them. To help identify whether
a species is gaining or losing electrons and consequently whether it is undergoing reduction
or oxidation, we can use oxidation numbers.
Writing oxidation numbers
While not official IUPAC convention, oxidation numbers are easily represented when
written directly above the element as –1, 0, +1, +2 and so on. It is important to distinguish
between this format and that of an ion. For example, the magnesium ion, Mg2+, has an ionic
charge of 2+, but its oxidation number is written as +2, usually like this:
+2 Oxidation number
Mg
2+
Assigning oxidation numbers
You can work out the oxidation number of an unknown element by applying several rules
to identify the oxidation numbers in other elements present in a species. Although many
elements will often have the same oxidation number, some elements can have multiple
oxidation numbers. One example of this is nitrogen, which can have oxidation numbers
ranging from –3 to +5!
The rules to follow when assigning oxidation numbers, as well as exceptions to some rules
that are particularly important to remember, are summarised in Table 3A–1.

Table 3A–1 Oxidation numbers rules and examples
Category Rule Example(s)
Free elements
Oxidation number = 0 (zero)
A free element is any element that
exists on its own and that is not a
charged ion. It may be monoatomic
or polyatomic but must contain only
one type of element.
Solid iron metal, Fe(s)
Hydrogen gas, H2(g)
Oxygen gas, O2(g)
Sulfur, S8(s)
Carbon, C(s)
Hydrogen
Typical oxidation
number = +1
Alternative oxidation
number = –1
The alternative oxidation number
only occurs when hydrogen is
part of a metal hydride. This is
because metal hydrides are ionic
compounds, and as such, the metal
ion will have an oxidation number
equal to its charge. To achieve an
overall neutral charge for metal
hydrides, hydrogen must have an
oxidation number of –1.
Methane, CH4
In this neutral molecule, hydrogen will
have its typical oxidation number of +1.
Exception: Sodium hydride, NaH.
In this case, the sodium ion will have an
oxidation number of +1, and the hydrogen
will have an oxidation number of –1.
Oxygen
Typical oxidation
number = –2
Alternative oxidation
number = –1
Oxygen will typically have an
oxidation number of –2 when it is
not a free element. The alternative
oxidation number occurs only when
oxygen is part of a peroxide, such as
hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
Carbon dioxide, CO2
In this neutral molecule, oxygen will have
an oxidation number of –2.
Exception: Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
In this molecule, hydrogen will have an
oxidation number of +1, and oxygen will
have an oxidation number of –1.
Pure ions
Oxidation number = ionic
charge
Pure ions have an oxidation number
equal to their ionic charge.
Aluminium ions, Al3+
These ions will have an ionic charge of 3+
and an oxidation number of +3.
Neutral compounds
The sum of the oxidation
numbers will be 0 (zero).
Neutral compounds, as well as
having an overall neutral charge,
will also be neutral in their overall
oxidation number total.
Water, H2O
In the neutral molecule of water, hydrogen
has an oxidation number of +1 and oxygen
has an oxidation number of –2. There are
two hydrogen atoms, so overall:
(2 × +1) + (–2) = 0.
Polyatomic ions
The sum of the oxidation
numbers = charge on
the ion
Polyatomic ions have an overall
oxidation number equal to the
charge on the polyatomic ion.
Sulfate ions, SO4
2–
These polyatomic ions have an overall
ionic charge of 2–. Oxygen has an
oxidation number of –2, and there are four
atoms of oxygen, so 4 × –2 = –8. Sulfur
must have an oxidation number of +6, to
match the overall charge on the ion.
–8 + (+6) = –2.
NOTE
The most electronegative element in a compound must be assigned a negative oxidation number.
Therefore, fluorine, being the most electronegative element, will always have an oxidation
number of –1. There are no exceptions to this scenario. More generally, group 17 halogens usually
have an oxidation number of –1, but not always. Chlorine, in some cases, can have a positive
oxidation number. An example of this is chlorine dioxide, ClO2, where chlorine has an oxidation
number of +4 because oxygen is more electronegative than chlorine and hence is assigned the
oxidation number of –2.

Using oxidation numbers
Identifying reducing agents and oxidising agents
A change in oxidation number of an element can be used to identify reducing agents and
oxidising agents. If the oxidation number increases for an element during a reaction, it
indicates that it has undergone oxidation, losing electrons (hence becoming ‘more positive’)
and is therefore called the reducing agent. Similarly, if the oxidation number decreases for
an element during a reaction, it indicates that it has undergone reduction, gaining electrons
(hence becoming ‘less positive’) and is therefore identified as the oxidising agent.
+2 0
Fe2+(aq) + 2e– Fe(s)
In the equation shown above, Fe2+(aq) ions are reduced because the oxidation number of
iron decreases from +2 to 0. Fe(s) has gained electrons.

3A REDUCTION AND OXIDATION

In half-equations such as this, an alternative way to determine whether reduction or
oxidation is taking place is to identify on which side of the equation the electrons are
present. If electrons are on the left-hand side, as shown in Figure 3A–2, then it is a
reduction half-equation. If electrons are on the right-hand side, then it is an oxidation
half-equation.

Solution

Pb2+(aq) + Zn(s) Pb(s) + Zn2+(aq)
Step 3 Answer the question
by using the change in
oxidation numbers of the
atoms/ions.
Pb2+(aq) ions have been reduced since the
oxidation number decreases from +2 to 0.
Zn(s) has been oxidised to Zn2+(aq) ions because
its oxidation number has increased from 0 to +2.
Zn(s) can be identified as the reducing agent, and
Pb2+(aq) ions are therefore the oxidising agent.
Important considerations when using oxidation numbers
In many redox reactions, the same elements are often involved as reactants and as
products. It is particularly important to note the difference in states and charges when
you are describing changes in a redox reaction or when you are asked to identify reducing
agents or oxidising agents. For example, copper ions, Cu2+(aq), are a different chemical
species compared to copper solid, Cu(s).
In addition, where the element whose oxidation number changes during a redox reaction
belongs to a polyatomic species, you should include the entire reactant compound that
contains the element when naming the reducing agent or oxidising agent. Consider

Iron, Fe, shows an oxidation number change from +3 to
0, meaning that it has been reduced (gained electrons).
However, if you were stating the oxidising agent, you
would state iron oxide, Fe2O3(s), as this is the chemical
species causing the oxidation of the carbon monoxide.
Similarly, the reducing agent for this reaction would be
identified as carbon monoxide, CO(g), even though only
the carbon undergoes an oxidation number increase
(due to oxidation, loss of electrons).

Identifying redox couples
During a redox reaction, the species acting as a reducing agent on the reactant side donates
(loses) electrons and in doing so forms a product that is an oxidising agent. At the same
time, the reactant acting as the oxidising agent is converted into a product that is a reducing
agent. The association of each reactant and the product it forms during a redox reaction is
referred to as a redox couple.
For example, when copper metal undergoes oxidation, losing electrons, the copper ions
produced could act as an oxidising agent, gaining electrons.

In a similar way, when zinc ions undergo reduction to zinc solid, the zinc solid could then

3A REDUCTION AND OXIDATION

Your ability to identify redox couples will be equally important in the next section of this
chapter when you explore how to write half-equations from full redox equations. In most
cases, you will be required to identify redox couples in full redox reactions rather than in
half-equations. Each redox reaction will therefore have two redox couples.
To identify a redox couple, the following are required:
1 There must be one species on the reactant side and one species on the product side of
the equation containing the same element.
2 There must be a change in oxidation number.
Figure 3A–3 shows that copper has an oxidation number of +2 in copper oxide, CuO, on
the reactant side, which decreases to 0 in copper (solid) on the product side. This is the
first redox couple. In a similar way, the hydrogen gas and water can be identified as the
second redox couple, where hydrogen shows an increase in oxidation number from
0 to +1.

Redox reactions can take place in a range of conditions, including neutral, basic or acidic

during a redox reaction and are important to consider when writing balanced equations
for a given scenario.
In basic conditions, the OH– ions play a role in the redox reactions that can take place.
You might already be familiar with alkaline batteries; these are examples of redox
reactions taking place in basic conditions. Car batteries, on the other hand, are an

3B WRITING REDOX EQUATIONS
89
When writing simple half-equations, which contain only one type of element, there are a
few steps that you need to follow. Applying the acronym ECS will help you to remember
these three critical steps.
1 Write the species on the correct side of the equation and then balance the Element
involved.
2 Balance the Charges in the equation. This is done by adding the appropriate number of
electrons to the more positive side of the half-equation. Note that you can apply your
understanding of oxidation numbers to each element in an equation to determine this.
3 Finally, ensure that you have included correct States for each element listed.
NOTE
When assigning states for redox equations in this course, note the following points.
1 Ions are always aqueous, (aq).
2 Electrons have no state.
3 Water, H2O, is always liquid, (l).

Step 1
E
From the description provided, write the species on the
appropriate side of the equation.
In this example, there are two bromine atoms on the
left-hand side, but only one on the right-hand side. To
balance the elements, we need to add an extra bromide

Identify which side is more positive and by how many units.
Add the appropriate number of electrons to that side.
In this example, the left-hand side is more positive by 2,

the oxygen.

equation.
E Balance the Electrons Add the appropriate number of electrons to the more positive side of the
equation.

Balancing in basic conditions
Balancing redox reactions in basic, or alkaline, conditions is slightly more complicated than
the steps involved for acidic conditions. The main reason is that each redox half-equation will
have both hydrogen ions, H+
, and hydroxide ions, OH–, added to it. These ions then combine
to make water, so there is some additional cancelling that takes place. We can still use the
KOHES method, but remember to include the two additional steps, which are shown below.

3B WRITING REDOX EQUATIONS
93
Combining half-equations
You should recall that redox reactions involve a transfer of electrons, where reduction and
oxidation both occur simultaneously. That is, you can’t have one without the other, and the
number of electrons that the oxidising agent gains, must be equal to the number of electrons
that the reducing agent loses. When considering half-equations, this means that the number
of electrons on the left-hand side of a reduction half-equation must be equal to the number
of electrons on the right-hand side of the corresponding oxidation half-equation.
In situations where the number of electrons differ in each half-equation, you must find the
lowest common multiple for the number of electrons. Do this by multiplying one or both
half-equations to ensure that the numbers of electrons are equal to this lowest common
multiple value. The half-equations can then be added or combined to give the full, overall
redox equation. Worked example 3B–5 shows you how to do this.
VIDEO

EXAMPLE 3B–5
Worked example 3B–5: Combining redox half-equations
Write the combined redox equation for the reaction between silver ions and nickel metal.
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write each of the balanced half-equations
that take place.
Process
Ag+(aq) + e–
→ Ag(s)
Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 2 Balance the electrons in each equation by
finding the lowest common multiple.
The silver half-equation only has one
electron, whereas the nickel half-equation
contains two electrons.
To balance the electrons, we need to multiply
the silver half-equation by 2.
2 × (Ag+(aq) + e–
2Ag+(aq) + 2e–
→ Ag(s))
→ 2Ag(s)
Step 3 Combine the half-equations by adding them
together. A simple way of doing this is to write
each species that is on the left of the arrow
of the half-equations together on the left and
write each species that is on the right of the
arrow of the half-equations together on the
right.
Note that it is important to place the arrows
directly below each other.
2Ag+(aq) + 2e–
→ 2Ag(s)
Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
_________________________________________
2Ag+(aq) + 2e– + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 4 The electrons on the left-hand side of the
arrow cancel out those on the right-hand
side, leaving the full balanced redox equation.
2Ag+(aq) + 2e– + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
_________________________________________
2Ag+(aq) + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq)

Writing balanced half-equations from full redox reactions
Sometimes you may be given an ionic equation, or full redox equation, from which you

follow the steps to balance each half-equation that were covered in Worked examples 3B–1,
3B–2 and 3B–3.

NOTE
There is sometimes a rare case where the reduction and oxidation reactions both result in the
same product being formed. An example of this is shown below.
Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 4H+(aq) + 2SO4
2–(aq) → 2PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(l)
The redox couples for such a reaction would each have the same product as indicated below.
Pb + PbO2 + 4H+ + 2SO4
2– → 2PbSO4 + 2H2O
Sometimes it is possible for the opposite to happen, where the same species in a redox reaction
acts as both the reducing agent and the oxidising agent. In one half-reaction it would undergo
reduction, and in the other half-reaction it would undergo oxidation. These are uncommon
circumstances but are important to be aware of.

BALANCED
EQUATIONS
Key things to check when writing balanced equations
It is important that you are able to write balanced equations, particularly in this section
of the course. Below are a few points to remember that you may find helpful.
1 Never change the subscripted numbers in a formula. This is only done when balancing
the formula of ionic compounds based on the individual charges of the cation and the
anion.
2 Only ever change coeﬃcients to balance elements.
3 A balanced equation must have the same number of each element on both the
reactant and product sides.
4 Charges on both the reactant and product sides must always be the same. One
common mistake is adding electrons to each side of a redox equation to make the
charges equal zero on both sides. Sometimes the charges will be zero, other times
positive or negative. They simply need to be the same on each side.
5 Finally, always make sure that you add states to any equations you write.
Let’s look at an example to apply these rules.

96 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
In the 1840s, a telegraph system used an early version of an electric primary cell that
consisted of two half-cells, each with an electrode and an aqueous electrolyte, which
were:
• a zinc electrode (Zn) in dilute sulfuric acid solution (H2SO4).
• a platinum electrode (Pt) in concentrated nitric acid (HNO3).
In the nitric acid half-cell, aqueous nitrate ions, NO3
–, were converted into nitrogen
dioxide, NO2.
Write the half-equation for this reaction by following these steps.
1 Write the initial reactant and products without changing the subscripts present
NO3
–

2 Balance the elements by following the steps in KOHES, which will change the
coeﬃcients.
NO3
– + 2H+ ⇌ NO2 + H2O
3 Check that the same number of elements is present on both the reactant and product
sides of the equation – which they are.
4 The reactant side of the equation has an overall charge of +1 (–1 + 2), whereas the
product side of the equation has an overall charge of 0. Therefore, balance the charges
by adding electrons to the more positive side, in this case the reactant side (one
electron needed).

Batteries are everywhere!
In a world where technology is advancing and
the number of portable and mobile gadgets
is increasing, have you ever wondered when
batteries were first invented, or what is it about
a battery that makes it possible to provide the
electrical energy to power these devices?
There are many different types of batteries in
use today. Some larger batteries store huge
amounts of power generated by solar farms,
others may be used to power electric cars, while
many are much smaller and can be found in
Figure 3C–1 Italian scientist Alessandro
Volta and his voltaic pile ‘battery’
consisting of alternating silver and
zinc discs
watches and hearing aids. Despite their size
differences, essentially all of them have a similar design enabling a redox chemical
reaction to take place that converts stored chemical energy into usable electrical energy.
American scientist and inventor, Benjamin Franklin, first used the term ‘battery’ in
the mid-1700s but it is believed that the first true battery was made by Italian scientist
Alessandro Volta in 1800. He created a stack of alternating discs of silver and zinc,
separated by cloth soaked in salt water, to generate a current. Since there were
no instruments available to detect weak currents at the time, he tested his batteries by
using his tongue! Volta discovered that changing the types of metals used, as well as
changing the number of discs, had an effect on the amount of current that the battery
could produce.
Another battery that you might already be familiar with is the lead–acid battery, which
was invented in the mid-1800s. It was the first-ever rechargeable battery and is still
commonly used today to provide the electrical energy needed to start cars and other
vehicles. Batteries are examples of galvanic cells, which are central to this section of the
Study Design.

EXPLAIN
Electrochemical cells
Electrochemical cells are systems that can convert stored chemical energy into electrical
energy or that can use electrical energy supplied to facilitate chemical reactions. Some can
even do both! In this chapter, we will focus on the former, also referred to as ‘galvanic cells’.
Galvanic cells are one type of electrochemical cell and involve spontaneous redox reactions.
NOTE
It is helpful to recognise that there are a number of interchangeable terms used when discussing
galvanic cells: ‘voltaic cell’, ‘primary cell’ and even the term ‘battery’ may all be used to reference
a galvanic cell. Essentially, they are equivalent in that they refer to an electrochemical cell that
spontaneously produces electrical energy from chemical energy.

Figure 3C–2 shows the spontaneous
redox reaction that occurs when solid
zinc metal, Zn(s), is placed directly
into a solution of copper(II) sulfate
containing copper ions, Cu2+(aq).
The overall redox reaction for this
process is:
Cu2+(aq) + Zn(s) → Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq)
Since the reactants are in direct
contact with each other, when the
reaction takes place, electrons are
exchanged directly in an exothermic
reaction, and chemical energy is
converted into thermal energy, which
is released into the surroundings
as heat.

energy, galvanic cells are systems
that separate the two reactants instead of allowing them to be in direct contact with one
another. This allows for the transformation of chemical energy into electrical energy that
can be harnessed and used to provide power. Without this separation, a spontaneous
exothermic reaction would still occur, involving a direct exchange of electrons between
the reactants. This would produce heat energy instead of the electrical energy that can be
generated by a galvanic cell.

Half-cells
Galvanic cells are comprised of two half-cells, which must be separated in order to produce
electrical energy. In Figure 3C–3 above, the Daniell cell has two beakers separating the
reactants. Each half-cell contains a solid conducting electrode partially submerged in a
solution of ions. It is on the surface of these electrodes where the reduction and oxidation
reactions take place. From Section 3A, we know that reduction involves a ‘gain’ of electrons,
while oxidation involves the production or ‘loss’ of electrons. In a galvanic cell, the
electrode where reduction occurs is called the cathode, which is also the positive terminal of
the cell. The electrode where oxidation occurs is called the anode, which in a galvanic cell is
also the negative terminal of the cell. The positive or negative ‘charge’ on these electrodes is
more accurately referred to as the electrode polarity.
Electrodes
In Figure 3C–4, solid zinc, Zn(s), is acting as the anode in the oxidation half-cell, which
also contains a solution of zinc ions, Zn2+(aq). Solid copper, Cu(s), is the cathode in the
reduction half-cell, which also contains a solution of copper(II) ions, Cu2+(aq). You might
recognise the species in each half-cell as conjugate redox pairs. Each half-cell contains a
reducing agent and a conjugate oxidising agent. In most galvanic cells, a metal is part of
the conjugate redox pair and is therefore often used as an electrode. When this is the case,
the electrodes are reactive and take part in the redox reactions occurring. During such

reactions, it is possible to observe an increase in mass at the cathode, where ions are
converted to solid metal atoms (reduction occurs). Conversely, at the anode, where metal
atoms are converted into ions, it is possible to observe a decrease in the mass of the metal
electrode being used (oxidation occurs).

Sometimes the conjugate redox pair in a half-cell does not include a metal, in which case
an inert electrode, such as graphite or platinum, may be used instead. These materials still
conduct electricity, but importantly, are not involved in the actual half-reactions that take
place on their surfaces. A final point worth noting about electrodes is that some half-
cells involving gases, such as hydrogen, oxygen or chlorine, may even have a special ‘gas
electrode’. Where the gas is a product of the reaction, there needs to be a way for the gas to
escape. If the gas is a reactant, however, it is usually necessary for the gas to be bubbled into
the solution surrounding the electrode. Figure 3C–5 shows an electrochemical cell that uses
these gas electrodes.

102 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
NOTE
Half-cells usually contain the species that react, but it is important to note that it is also possible for
other species that are not involved in the reaction to be present. Sometimes there may be multiple
ions present in a solution, often used to supply the reactive ions to the solution. For example, in the
Daniell cell, the copper ions are supplied by copper(II) sulfate. Sulfate ions, SO4
2– are also present
but would be considered spectator ions as they do not take part in the actual reaction.

circuit in a
galvanic cell and

that balance the
charges formed
from each
half-cell
Electrolyte

solution or paste

and helps to

The salt bridge
The salt bridge plays three important roles in a galvanic cell:
1 It connects the circuit, allowing for the flow of charged particles through the circuit
2 It allows for the physical separation of half-cells, preventing reactants from coming into
direct contact with each other
3 It is usually soaked in a non-reactive electrolyte solution consisting of cations and anions
that can migrate into the solutions to balance the charges of the reaction occurring in
each half-cell (as shown in Figure 3C–4 with Na+ and Cl– ions).
Without a salt bridge, charge would accumulate in each of the cells and the redox reaction
would soon cease.
Two common electrolytes used in galvanic cells are concentrated potassium nitrate, KNO3,
and concentrated potassium chloride, KCl; however, other substances may also be used,
including sodium sulfate, Na2SO4, and sodium chloride, NaCl. Often the salt bridge is
simply a piece of filter paper soaked in the electrolyte and draped across the two solutions
in each beaker.
Migration of ions from the salt bridge
Consider the redox reactions taking place in the Daniell cell shown in Figure 3C–4.
Reduction at the cathode: Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Oxidation at the anode: Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e–
If we focus on the reduction reaction, we can see that it is using positive cations from the
solution and converting them to neutral solid metal atoms. As a result, those cations are
essentially removed from the solution as they take part in the reaction, so there would start
to be an imbalance between the cations and anions in the solution. To balance the charges,
positively charged cations from the salt bridge migrate into the solution of the reduction
half-cell. For example, if NaCl is the electrolyte solution being used in the cell, it would
be sodium ions, Na+, that migrate towards the cathode. It is important to note that this
‘balancing’ of charge is happening in real-time and that if it did not, the galvanic cell would
cease to function.
Looking at the anode reaction, the opposite is occurring, as solid zinc metal atoms are
oxidised to zinc ions, Zn2+. In this half-cell, the balance of charge in the solution would
start to shift to have more cations than anions, so to balance this change, negatively charged
anions migrate from the salt bridge towards the anode. If NaCl is the electrolyte solution
being used in the cell, it would mean chloride ions, Cl–, perform this function.

3C FEATURES OF GALVANIC CELLS
103
NOTE
An easy way to remember this movement of ions in the electrolyte (salt) bridge is:
– anions to the anode
– cations to the cathode.
As well as observing a change in mass at the cathode and anode, sometimes other
important observations can be made that provide some indication that a reaction is taking
place within a galvanic cell. In some half-cells, gases may be produced in a half-reaction
that result in bubbles forming on the surface of the electrode. Another observation might
be a change in appearance of the solvent used in a half-cell. For example, in the Daniell cell,
the copper(II) sulfate solution has a blue colour. However, as the reaction proceeds and
copper ions in that solution undergo reduction, the concentration of copper ions, Cu2+, will
decrease and the intensity of that blue coloured solution will also decrease over time.
The external circuit
The separation of reactants in a galvanic cell is crucial and allows the electrons produced
by oxidation at the anode to flow to the cathode where they then take part in the reduction
reaction. It is important to recognise that the electrons do not move into the solutions.
Instead, the electrons flow from one electrode to the other via the external circuit, which is
made up of wires connecting the electrodes. In some cell diagrams you may see light globes
used in place of the voltmeter shown in Figure 3C–3 or 3C–4, which would glow when
current flows through the external circuit.

NOTE
An important skill is to determine the direction of flow of electrons. Although it should be
possible to work out the direction by looking at the half-equations to see where the electrons
are being used and where they are being produced, another convenient way to remember the
direction is that they travel from the anode to the cathode (A to the C), which is in alphabetical
order.

104 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Drawing and labelling galvanic cell diagrams
A key skill is being able to use the information about a reaction taking place in a galvanic
cell to draw and/or label key aspects of the cell. This might include:
• writing the half-reactions or overall reaction occurring in the cell
• labelling the anode and cathode
• labelling the polarity of the electrodes
• labelling the direction of electron flow
• labelling the direction of flow of ions from the salt bridge.
Being able to determine many of these characteristics relies on identifying the cathode and
the anode. To assist with this, make use of the galvanic cell mnemonic (memory aid): the
Happy Red Cat.
• Happy corresponds to the positive terminal.
• Red corresponds to reduction.
• Cat corresponds to cathode.
In galvanic cells, these three aspects always combine in the reduction half-cell, so you only
need to identify one of the three aspects to quickly work out the other two. The opposite
holds true for the oxidation half-cell: negative, oxidation and anode.

Solution
Step 1 Logic There is no specific order in which to
approach a question like this, but the
key is to identify what information you
are given and to then try to apply the
‘happy red cat’ mnemonic.
By identifying the reactions shown
for each half-cell, and applying what
we already understand about redox
reactions, we can see the equation
on the left for zinc is producing two
electrons. Therefore, ‘E’ is oxidation.
We can also see that in the half-
reaction on the right the copper ions
are combining with two electrons,
which means that ‘I’ is reduction.
Process
Loss of electrons:
Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e–
Therefore, ‘E’ is oxidation.
Gain of electrons:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Therefore, ‘I’ is reduction.

106 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Step 2 We can then apply the ‘happy red cat’
to labels F and G.
Happy red cat:
Happy: positive
Red: reduction, which occurs on the
right-hand side.
Cat: cathode must also be on the
right-hand side.
Therefore, ‘F’ is cathode and ‘G’ is
positive.
Step 3 By elimination, this tells us which
terms correspond to labels B and C.
If ‘F’ is the cathode, ‘B’ is the anode
and ‘C’ is negative.
Step 4 The direction of electron flow can now
be determined, as we know electrons
flow from anode to the cathode (A to
the C).
Electrons flow from left to right in
this cell, so an arrow pointing right is
appropriate for ‘A’ on the diagram.
Step 5 For ion flow, we know that anions flow
to the anode and cations flow to the
cathode.
Because KNO3 is shown as the
electrolyte solution, the anions would
be nitrate ions, NO3
–, and the cations
would be potassium ions, K+. We can
now add these species to labels D and
H respectively.
Step 6 Complete the diagram. See below.

EXPLAIN
Potential difference
Under the same conditions, the type of reactants being used will influence the amount of
voltage that can be produced by a galvanic cell. The voltage produced is caused by the potential
difference in the amount of energy that the valence electrons have in atoms of different
elements. Electrons flow through the external circuit because of this difference in potential
energy between the two electrodes. More simply, the reactant in one half-cell has a stronger
tendency to move electrons through the circuit compared to the other half-cell. The greater
the difference between the two reactants, the greater the potential voltage the cell will be.

Figure 3D–1 Two similar galvanic cells. The voltage produced in the Daniell cell on the
left is 1.10 volts compared to the cell on the right, which can produce 2.62 volts under
the same conditions. In the cell on the right, the zinc half-cell has been replaced with a
magnesium half-cell.
On the Daniell cell represented in Figure 3D–1, on the left-hand side, the voltmeter measuring
the flow of electric current moving between the two half-cells shows that 1.10 volts is being
produced. In the cell shown on the right-hand side, the zinc half-cell has been substituted with
a magnesium half-cell. Under the same conditions, the second cell is able to produce 2.62 volts.
This difference is due to magnesium being more reactive and having a greater tendency to
move electrons through the external circuit compared to the zinc half-cell.
Standard electrode potential
Each half-cell has a unique standard electrode potential, which is the amount of voltage it
can produce at standard conditions. For these experiments, standard conditions refers to
a temperature of 25°C (298 K), solvent concentrations of 1 M and a pressure of 100 kPa.
As redox reactions involve both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously, it
is not possible to measure the electrode potential of one half-cell without connecting it
to another. Reduction occurs in one half-cell, while oxidation occurs simultaneously in
the other. For this reason, a standard hydrogen electrode has been used to determine the
comparative electrode potentials of other half-reactions – this is then referred to as their
standard electrode potentials.
The standard hydrogen electrode
The value of the standard electrode potential for different half-cells has been experimentally
determined using the standard hydrogen electrode as a reference. To develop the scale,
this half-cell was arbitrarily assigned an electrode potential of 0.00 volts under standard
conditions. Other half-cells were then measured against the standard hydrogen electrode to

is taking place, not reduction, so this half-reaction must be reversed. Whenever a reaction
is reversed, the sign for the value of the standard electrode potential must also be reversed.
The oxidation reaction will be the one listed lowest on the electrochemical series, as shown:

FEATURES OF
ELECTROLYTIC
CELLS
LINK
To determine the overall cell potential, or voltage, that can be produced by the zinc–nickel
cell from page 112 under standard conditions, simply add the two standard electrode
potentials together:
–0.25 + (+0.76) = +0.51 volts
A positive value obtained for the cell potential indicates that the reaction is spontaneous,
which is expected in a galvanic cell. This is useful to remember when performing
calculations of cell potentials. A negative value would mean that the electrochemical cell is
an electrolytic cell, not a galvanic cell. Electrolytic cells are covered further in Section 7A.
NOTE
The values should only be added together if the half-equation and standard electrode potentials
are reversed for the anode half-reaction.
A useful way to calculate the cell potential directly from the electrochemical series, without
reversing equations and values, is to use the following rule:
E 0
cell = E 0
Reduction reaction – E 0
Oxidation reaction
In Figure 3D–3, notice that the reduction half-equation for nickel appears higher up in the
electrochemical series, compared to the oxidation reaction for zinc. This will be true for
ALL galvanic cells. This is another alternative way to remember which electrode potential
should be subtracted from the other when calculating cell potentials in galvanic cells, as in
the following rule:
E 0
cell = E 0
Higher half-reaction – E 0
Lower half-reaction
NOTE
As well as stressing the importance of always including units, it is essential to note that the value
for cell potential is directional, and the positive or negative sign must always be written in front
of the value to indicate this.

Predicting redox reactions in galvanic cells
The electrochemical series can be used to help identify whether a reaction will occur
spontaneously. For a reaction to occur, the oxidising agent must be located higher on the
left-hand side of the series, compared to the reducing agent, which must be located lower
and on the right-hand side of the series. If the species are not positioned in this way, no
reaction will occur.

116 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Solution
a Pb2+(aq) is the oxidising agent, as it is the species highest on the left-hand side and
Cd(s) is the reducing agent, as it is located lower on the right-hand side. As such they
will undergo a spontaneous reaction.
b No reaction will occur, since both species are oxidising agents and are both located
on the left-hand side of the electrochemical series.
c No reaction will occur, since Ni2+(aq), as the oxidising agent on the left-hand side is
lower than Pb2+(aq), which is the reducing agent, located higher on the right-hand side.
Identifying reactions using the
electrochemical series
The half-equations occurring in a galvanic cell are
not always provided. However, if all the species
present are known, the electrochemical series can
be used to identify the half-reactions occurring, to
then determine the overall redox reaction and to
calculate the cell potential for a given combination
of reactants. On the electrochemical series, the
species that is highest on the left-hand side of the
electrochemical series will undergo reduction.
The species that is lowest on the right-hand side
will undergo oxidation, meaning the reaction on
the electrochemical series for this half-reaction
must be written in reverse.

E 0 = –0.13
Step 2 The species highest on the left-hand
side will be the strongest oxidising
agent, and as such will undergo
reduction. In this example, silver
ions, Ag+ are the strongest oxidising
agent. The species lowest on the
right-hand side will be strongest
reducing agent, and as such will
undergo oxidation. In this example,
solid lead, Pb(s) is the strongest
reducing agent.

Step 3 Write the equations for reduction and
oxidation, remembering to reverse
the oxidation reaction, which is the
lower of the two. It is important to
note the use of correct arrows when
writing these half-equations. The
electrochemical series represents
each reduction half-equation with
equilibrium arrows because it can be
reversed, depending on what else it is
reacting with. However, when writing
half-equations for a particular cell, a
critical part of what we are predicting is
the direction in which these reactions
will occur, and hence the use of a solid
forward arrow is appropriate.
b Ag+(aq) + e–
E 0 = +0.80
→ Ag(s)
Pb(s) → Pb2+(aq) + 2e–
E 0 = +0.13
Step 4 To determine the cell potential, the
values in Step 3 can be added,
since the oxidation reaction and its
standard electrode potential have
been reversed.
Alternatively, the values can be
substituted straight into the following
equation from the electrochemical
series.
c +0.80 + (+0.13) = +0.93 volts
E 0
cell = E 0
Reduction reaction – E 0
Oxidation reaction
E 0
cell = +0.80 – (–0.13) = +0.93 volts
Step 5 Write the overall equation by
balancing electrons and combining
the half-equations. In this example,
there are two electrons in the oxidation
half-equation but only one electron
in the reduction half-equation, which
consequently needs to be doubled.
Now that the number of electrons is
the same on each side, the electrons
can be cancelled to leave the full
redox equation.
2 × (Ag+(aq) + e–
→ Ag(s))
2Ag+(aq) + 2e–
→ 2Ag(s)
Pb(s) → Pb2+(aq) + 2e–
2Ag+(aq) + Pb(s) → 2Ag(s) + Pb2+(aq)
Step 6 Add the cell potential value to the
overall equation, making sure to
include units (volts).
d 2Ag+(aq) + Pb(s) → 2Ag(s) + Pb2+(aq)
E0 = +0.93 volts
NOTE
The standard electrode potential indicates the potential for a reaction to occur – it is never
multiplied when calculating cell potentials.

Limitations of the electrochemical series
Recall that the electrochemical series was derived using standard laboratory conditions. This
means that unpredictable things may occur when a galvanic cell is placed under conditions
that vary significantly from SLC. Sometimes a different reaction may take place, or there may
in fact be no reaction at all, even if a reaction is predicted to occur spontaneously. Changing
the temperature from 25°C or using solutions that have a concentration different to 1 M, may
result in different reactions taking place. The increased concentration of one particular ion
may mean that it reacts instead of the ions predicted on the electrochemical series. This can
be seen when the electrode potential values, E0, are close together.
One final consideration is that the electrochemical series does not provide any indication
of the reaction rate. Sometimes reactions may be predicted to occur, but they may do so
very slowly. Sometimes reactions may be taking place at such a slow rate that they appear
not to react, even though the electrochemical series predicts that a reaction is taking place.
For example, observing a galvanic cell for 20 minutes may not be sufficient time to observe
products of reactions being formed or other changes expected in the half-cells. You will
study rates of reaction more in Section 5B.
Sometimes, as well as the same species appearing in multiple positions on the electrochemical
series, some half-reactions may also include multiple species. Two examples of this are
shown below where there are hydrogen ions, H+(aq) shown as part of the half-reaction. This
indicates that for the reaction to proceed, there must also be a suitable supply of hydrogen
ions, which would usually mean using an acidic solution. It is important to consider all species
when predicting whether reactions will occur, but also when predicting what the products of
a particular galvanic cell may be. Measuring pH changes or using acid–base indicators may be
one additional way to detect whether a reaction is taking place.

Predicting reactions with more than one type of ion present
In some galvanic cells, electrodes can be inert, in which case they are not considered
when trying to predict the reactions occurring. Similarly, solutions in each half-cell
may contain more than one type of reactive ion. In such cases, it is important to

SKILLS:
PREDICTING
REACTIONS WITH
MORE THAN ONE
TYPE OF ION
PRESENT
remember redox reactions will only occur between the strongest oxidising agent in the
reduction half-cell and the strongest reducing agent in the oxidation half-cell. If there are many ion species
present, only two will react, and the rest will be considered to be spectator ions.
Some species appear more than once on the electrochemical series on both the left-hand side and right-
hand side of the series. When predicting reactions, all occurrences of each species must be considered to
accurately identify the strongest reducing agent and strongest oxidising agent.
Further consideration should also be given regarding what would happen in a galvanic cell where one of
these ions is completely used up by the reaction. If one completely reacts, the next strongest species will
start to react, provided there is another species available. There would be a decrease in the amount of
voltage produced, but it is important to recognise that whenever other species are present, the reaction
may not simply ‘stop’.
The example below highlights a type of question where more than one type of ion is present, as well as the
worked solution for this example.
Question
A galvanic cell consists of one half-cell with an inert platinum, Pt(s), electrode in a 1 M solution of
Cu2+(aq), Zn2+(aq) and Ni2+(aq) ions. The other half-cell has a solid iron electrode, Fe(s), in a 1 M solution
containing iron(II) ions, Fe2+(aq).
a Identify the strongest reducing agent and oxidising agent.
b State which electrode is the anode, and which is the cathode.
c Write the half-reactions occurring initially at the anode and cathode.
d Calculate the standard cell potential.
e Explain what you would expect to observe at the cathode over time.
Solution
Logic Process
Step 1 Use the electrochemical series to
highlight all the reactive species
present. It is often useful to highlight
the species present in one half-cell
differently from those in the other.
This can make it easier to identify
the reduction and oxidation
reactions that will take place.
The species highest on the left-hand
side of a reaction arrow will be the
strongest oxidising agent.
The species lowest on the right-
hand side of a reaction arrow will be
the strongest reducing agent.

Step 2 To identify the cathode, apply the
‘happy red cat’. Given that the iron
electrode is the strongest reducing
agent, undergoing oxidation, it
must be the anode. Therefore, the
strongest oxidising agent, copper
ions undergo reduction in the other
half-cell, where platinum is the
electrode, the cathode must be
platinum.
b Anode: Fe(s)
Cathode: Pt(s)
Step 3 Having identified the strongest
oxidising agent, Cu2+(aq) and
strongest reducing agent, Fe(s),
use the electrochemical series
to write the equations for each
species, remembering to reverse the
oxidation reaction, being the lower
of the two.
c Reduction: Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Oxidation: Fe(s) → Fe2+(aq) + 2e–

the following equation from the
electrochemical series.
d E 0
cell = E 0
Reduction reaction – E 0
Oxidation reaction
E 0
cell = +0.34 – (–0.44) = +0.78 volts
Step 5 Write your explanation of what
you would expect, given the cell
potential.
e At the cathode:
Initially copper ions, Cu2+(aq) would be reduced to solid
copper, Cu(s). This would appear as a thin coating on
the surface of the platinum electrode. The mass of the
electrode would be increasing. Over time, all the copper
ions may react. At this point, the next strongest oxidising
agent present in the half-cell solution would be nickel
ions, Ni2+(aq), which would be reduced to solid nickel,
Ni(s). This would create another thin layer on the platinum
electrode, over the top of the copper layer and would result
in a further increase in mass of the electrode. During this
time, the cell potential would be reduced to +0.19 volts.
E 0
cell = –0.25 – (–0.44) = +0.19 volts
Once all of the nickel ions have reacted, the reaction would cease to produce any electrical energy since the
remaining ions at the cathode are zinc ions, Zn2+(aq), and these occur lower on the electrochemical series
than the strongest reducing agent, which is still Fe(s).

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can explain the role and importance of separating half-cells in galvanic cells
CODE: 3C.3

WHAT (concept explanation):
Separated half-cells prevent direct contact between oxidising and reducing agents, forcing electrons to travel through the external circuit rather than transferring directly, converting chemical energy to electrical energy instead of heat.

WHY (importance):
Without separation, spontaneous exothermic reactions release energy as heat (as when zinc is placed directly in copper sulfate), making the energy unusable for electrical devices.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
When Zn(s) is placed directly in Cu2+(aq) solution, heat is produced. When separated in a galvanic cell, the same reaction produces 1.10 volts of electrical energy to power devices.

SUBTOPIC: Galvanic Cell Features
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic examines the design features of galvanic cells, including the roles of separated half-cells, electrodes, salt bridges, and electrolytes. It covers how these components work together to convert chemical energy from spontaneous redox reactions into usable electrical energy.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding galvanic cell design is essential for battery technology, fuel cells, and electrochemical applications. These principles explain how batteries work, why certain designs are chosen, and how to optimize cell performance for different applications.

TOPIC: Galvanic Cells
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Study of redox reactions, oxidation numbers, and electrochemical cells that convert chemical energy to electrical energy. Includes writing balanced half-equations, understanding galvanic cell design, and using the electrochemical series to predict reactions and calculate cell potentials.

What is oxidation?
You have likely heard of reduction and oxidation from your study of chemistry.
However, where did these terms come from, and when and how were redox reactions
first discovered?
The terms ‘reduction’ and ‘oxidation’ stem from the historical exploration of
combustion, which was the first type of oxidation studied. In 1775, English scientist,
Joseph Priestley, who had discovered oxygen about a year earlier, met with French
chemist, Antoine Lavoisier, who went on to revolutionise the field of chemistry by
investigating the role of oxygen in combustion reactions. Lavoisier’s work helped to
later establish that combustion reactions involved materials combining with oxygen,
and these reactions were classified as oxidation reactions. Alternatively, those reactions
where oxygen was produced were classified as reduction reactions.
Often, when oxygen is involved in a reaction, it will be acting as an oxidising agent.
However, this is not always the case; but when redox reactions were first discovered by
Priestley and Lavoisier, they believed that oxygen was always involved, which is another
reason why the term ‘oxidation’ was adopted.
Figure 3A–1 French chemist Antoine Lavoisier revolutionised the field of
chemistry with his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion reactions.

EXPLAIN
Most of the material in the following two sections is also covered in Units 1 and 2. However,
it is also assessable in Units 3 and 4, hence its inclusion. Where possible, questions and
examples have been altered. However, please note that in Section 3B, new material has
been added in order to cover redox reactions under basic conditions. This was not required
learning for the Units 1 and 2 course and is potentially examinable content.
What is redox?
The word redox is a combined abbreviation for reduction and oxidation, which are two
different processes that occur simultaneously during a redox reaction. A redox reaction
involves an electron transfer from one chemical species to another.
Therefore, reduction can be defined as the gain of electrons and oxidation as the loss of
electrons. A nice way to remember this is using the mnemonic OILRIG – Oxidation Is Loss
(of electrons), Reduction Is Gain (of electrons).

Oxidation is Loss

NOTE
There is also a ‘rule of thumb’, most often used by organic chemists, which identifies a species in
a reaction as being oxidised due to a gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen, or being reduced due to
a loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen. Note, however, that redox reactions do not always involve
hydrogen or oxygen.
The reaction between solid magnesium ribbon and oxygen gas, if performed at high
temperatures, produces solid magnesium oxide. The redox equation for this reaction can
be written as
Redox reaction
a reaction
involving a
transfer of
electrons. Both
reduction and
oxidation occur
simultaneously

and reducing
agents
2Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2Mg2+(s) + 2O2–(s)
Reducing agents and oxidising agents
You should recall that ionic compounds are formed when there is a large difference in the
electronegativities of the bonding atoms. This commonly occurs between a non-metal
and a group 1 metal, a group 2 metal or a transition metal with a low oxidation number.
In a similar way, the redox reaction between magnesium and oxygen involves a transfer
of electrons from the magnesium atoms to the oxygen atoms. Given that oxidation is
the loss of electrons, in this reaction magnesium has undergone oxidation; it has been
oxidised. Similarly, the oxygen has undergone reduction; it has been reduced, since it is
the molecule that gained the electrons.

It is also useful to identify the reducing agent and the oxidising agent in a reaction. The
species that causes oxidation of the other reactant (species) is termed the oxidising agent.
The species that causes reduction to occur to the other species is termed the reducing agent.
In the example on the previous page, magnesium causes the reduction of oxygen gas and
at the same time undergoes oxidation itself, losing electrons. Thus, magnesium can be
identified as the reducing agent in this reaction. Similarly, oxygen causes the oxidation
of magnesium and at the same time undergoes reduction itself, gaining electrons. Thus,
oxygen can be identified as the oxidising agent in this reaction.

Oxidation numbers
It is not always easy to identify whether electrons are being transferred or not in a chemical
reaction, nor is it obvious which species is gaining or losing them. To help identify whether
a species is gaining or losing electrons and consequently whether it is undergoing reduction
or oxidation, we can use oxidation numbers.
Writing oxidation numbers
While not official IUPAC convention, oxidation numbers are easily represented when
written directly above the element as –1, 0, +1, +2 and so on. It is important to distinguish
between this format and that of an ion. For example, the magnesium ion, Mg2+, has an ionic
charge of 2+, but its oxidation number is written as +2, usually like this:
+2 Oxidation number
Mg
2+
Assigning oxidation numbers
You can work out the oxidation number of an unknown element by applying several rules
to identify the oxidation numbers in other elements present in a species. Although many
elements will often have the same oxidation number, some elements can have multiple
oxidation numbers. One example of this is nitrogen, which can have oxidation numbers
ranging from –3 to +5!
The rules to follow when assigning oxidation numbers, as well as exceptions to some rules
that are particularly important to remember, are summarised in Table 3A–1.

Table 3A–1 Oxidation numbers rules and examples
Category Rule Example(s)
Free elements
Oxidation number = 0 (zero)
A free element is any element that
exists on its own and that is not a
charged ion. It may be monoatomic
or polyatomic but must contain only
one type of element.
Solid iron metal, Fe(s)
Hydrogen gas, H2(g)
Oxygen gas, O2(g)
Sulfur, S8(s)
Carbon, C(s)
Hydrogen
Typical oxidation
number = +1
Alternative oxidation
number = –1
The alternative oxidation number
only occurs when hydrogen is
part of a metal hydride. This is
because metal hydrides are ionic
compounds, and as such, the metal
ion will have an oxidation number
equal to its charge. To achieve an
overall neutral charge for metal
hydrides, hydrogen must have an
oxidation number of –1.
Methane, CH4
In this neutral molecule, hydrogen will
have its typical oxidation number of +1.
Exception: Sodium hydride, NaH.
In this case, the sodium ion will have an
oxidation number of +1, and the hydrogen
will have an oxidation number of –1.
Oxygen
Typical oxidation
number = –2
Alternative oxidation
number = –1
Oxygen will typically have an
oxidation number of –2 when it is
not a free element. The alternative
oxidation number occurs only when
oxygen is part of a peroxide, such as
hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
Carbon dioxide, CO2
In this neutral molecule, oxygen will have
an oxidation number of –2.
Exception: Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
In this molecule, hydrogen will have an
oxidation number of +1, and oxygen will
have an oxidation number of –1.
Pure ions
Oxidation number = ionic
charge
Pure ions have an oxidation number
equal to their ionic charge.
Aluminium ions, Al3+
These ions will have an ionic charge of 3+
and an oxidation number of +3.
Neutral compounds
The sum of the oxidation
numbers will be 0 (zero).
Neutral compounds, as well as
having an overall neutral charge,
will also be neutral in their overall
oxidation number total.
Water, H2O
In the neutral molecule of water, hydrogen
has an oxidation number of +1 and oxygen
has an oxidation number of –2. There are
two hydrogen atoms, so overall:
(2 × +1) + (–2) = 0.
Polyatomic ions
The sum of the oxidation
numbers = charge on
the ion
Polyatomic ions have an overall
oxidation number equal to the
charge on the polyatomic ion.
Sulfate ions, SO4
2–
These polyatomic ions have an overall
ionic charge of 2–. Oxygen has an
oxidation number of –2, and there are four
atoms of oxygen, so 4 × –2 = –8. Sulfur
must have an oxidation number of +6, to
match the overall charge on the ion.
–8 + (+6) = –2.
NOTE
The most electronegative element in a compound must be assigned a negative oxidation number.
Therefore, fluorine, being the most electronegative element, will always have an oxidation
number of –1. There are no exceptions to this scenario. More generally, group 17 halogens usually
have an oxidation number of –1, but not always. Chlorine, in some cases, can have a positive
oxidation number. An example of this is chlorine dioxide, ClO2, where chlorine has an oxidation
number of +4 because oxygen is more electronegative than chlorine and hence is assigned the
oxidation number of –2.

Using oxidation numbers
Identifying reducing agents and oxidising agents
A change in oxidation number of an element can be used to identify reducing agents and
oxidising agents. If the oxidation number increases for an element during a reaction, it
indicates that it has undergone oxidation, losing electrons (hence becoming ‘more positive’)
and is therefore called the reducing agent. Similarly, if the oxidation number decreases for
an element during a reaction, it indicates that it has undergone reduction, gaining electrons
(hence becoming ‘less positive’) and is therefore identified as the oxidising agent.
+2 0
Fe2+(aq) + 2e– Fe(s)
In the equation shown above, Fe2+(aq) ions are reduced because the oxidation number of
iron decreases from +2 to 0. Fe(s) has gained electrons.

3A REDUCTION AND OXIDATION

In half-equations such as this, an alternative way to determine whether reduction or
oxidation is taking place is to identify on which side of the equation the electrons are
present. If electrons are on the left-hand side, as shown in Figure 3A–2, then it is a
reduction half-equation. If electrons are on the right-hand side, then it is an oxidation
half-equation.

0 0
Pb2+(aq) + Zn(s) Pb(s) + Zn2+(aq)
Step 3 Answer the question
by using the change in
oxidation numbers of the
atoms/ions.
Pb2+(aq) ions have been reduced since the
oxidation number decreases from +2 to 0.
Zn(s) has been oxidised to Zn2+(aq) ions because
its oxidation number has increased from 0 to +2.
Zn(s) can be identified as the reducing agent, and
Pb2+(aq) ions are therefore the oxidising agent.
Important considerations when using oxidation numbers
In many redox reactions, the same elements are often involved as reactants and as
products. It is particularly important to note the difference in states and charges when
you are describing changes in a redox reaction or when you are asked to identify reducing
agents or oxidising agents. For example, copper ions, Cu2+(aq), are a different chemical
species compared to copper solid, Cu(s).
In addition, where the element whose oxidation number changes during a redox reaction
belongs to a polyatomic species, you should include the entire reactant compound that
contains the element when naming the reducing agent or oxidising agent. Consider

Iron, Fe, shows an oxidation number change from +3 to
0, meaning that it has been reduced (gained electrons).
However, if you were stating the oxidising agent, you
would state iron oxide, Fe2O3(s), as this is the chemical
species causing the oxidation of the carbon monoxide.
Similarly, the reducing agent for this reaction would be
identified as carbon monoxide, CO(g), even though only
the carbon undergoes an oxidation number increase
(due to oxidation, loss of electrons).

Identifying redox couples
During a redox reaction, the species acting as a reducing agent on the reactant side donates
(loses) electrons and in doing so forms a product that is an oxidising agent. At the same
time, the reactant acting as the oxidising agent is converted into a product that is a reducing
agent. The association of each reactant and the product it forms during a redox reaction is
referred to as a redox couple.
For example, when copper metal undergoes oxidation, losing electrons, the copper ions
produced could act as an oxidising agent, gaining electrons.
Redox couple
Cu(s) Cu2+(aq) + 2e–

In a similar way, when zinc ions undergo reduction to zinc solid, the zinc solid could then

3A REDUCTION AND OXIDATION

Your ability to identify redox couples will be equally important in the next section of this
chapter when you explore how to write half-equations from full redox equations. In most
cases, you will be required to identify redox couples in full redox reactions rather than in
half-equations. Each redox reaction will therefore have two redox couples.
To identify a redox couple, the following are required:
1 There must be one species on the reactant side and one species on the product side of
the equation containing the same element.
2 There must be a change in oxidation number.
Figure 3A–3 shows that copper has an oxidation number of +2 in copper oxide, CuO, on
the reactant side, which decreases to 0 in copper (solid) on the product side. This is the
first redox couple. In a similar way, the hydrogen gas and water can be identified as the
second redox couple, where hydrogen shows an increase in oxidation number from
0 to +1.

during a redox reaction, it means that element is not undergoing reduction or oxidation.

and Figure 3A–4 summarise the key concepts covered but also highlight how the
language you need to know and understand has a lot of similarities. This can sometimes
cause confusion initially, so it is important to use the glossary terms throughout this

Redox reactions can take place in a range of conditions, including neutral, basic or acidic

during a redox reaction and are important to consider when writing balanced equations
for a given scenario.
In basic conditions, the OH– ions play a role in the redox reactions that can take place.
You might already be familiar with alkaline batteries; these are examples of redox
reactions taking place in basic conditions. Car batteries, on the other hand, are an
example of redox reactions taking place in acidic conditions. You will learn more about

3B WRITING REDOX EQUATIONS
89
When writing simple half-equations, which contain only one type of element, there are a
few steps that you need to follow. Applying the acronym ECS will help you to remember
these three critical steps.
1 Write the species on the correct side of the equation and then balance the Element
involved.
2 Balance the Charges in the equation. This is done by adding the appropriate number of
electrons to the more positive side of the half-equation. Note that you can apply your
understanding of oxidation numbers to each element in an equation to determine this.
3 Finally, ensure that you have included correct States for each element listed.
NOTE
When assigning states for redox equations in this course, note the following points.
1 Ions are always aqueous, (aq).
2 Electrons have no state.
3 Water, H2O, is always liquid, (l).

have both hydrogen ions, H+
, and hydroxide ions, OH–, added to it. These ions then combine
to make water, so there is some additional cancelling that takes place. We can still use the
KOHES method, but remember to include the two additional steps, which are shown below.
Step Explanation
K Balance the Key element This will be the element that is not oxygen or hydrogen. This is done by
placing the correct coefficient in front of the required species.
O Balance the Oxygen This is done by adding water, H2O, to the opposite side of the equation
to the oxygen.
H Balance the Hydrogen This is done by adding hydrogen ions, H+, to the appropriate side of the
equation.

equation.
Additional
step
H2O
Combine the H+ and OH– ions Combine any H+ and OH– ions that appear on the same side of the
equation, to make water. These water molecules can then potentially
cancel with any other water molecules on the opposite side of the equation.

The dichromate ion, Cr2O7

Step 5
H2O
Combine the H+ and OH– ions to
make water, then cancel the water
molecules on each side of the
equation where possible. In this
example, there are seven H2O that
cancel on each side.
Cr2O7

3B WRITING REDOX EQUATIONS
93
Combining half-equations
You should recall that redox reactions involve a transfer of electrons, where reduction and
oxidation both occur simultaneously. That is, you can’t have one without the other, and the
number of electrons that the oxidising agent gains, must be equal to the number of electrons
that the reducing agent loses. When considering half-equations, this means that the number
of electrons on the left-hand side of a reduction half-equation must be equal to the number
of electrons on the right-hand side of the corresponding oxidation half-equation.
In situations where the number of electrons differ in each half-equation, you must find the
lowest common multiple for the number of electrons. Do this by multiplying one or both
half-equations to ensure that the numbers of electrons are equal to this lowest common
multiple value. The half-equations can then be added or combined to give the full, overall
redox equation. Worked example 3B–5 shows you how to do this.

EXAMPLE 3B–5
Worked example 3B–5: Combining redox half-equations
Write the combined redox equation for the reaction between silver ions and nickel metal.
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write each of the balanced half-equations
that take place.
Process
Ag+(aq) + e–
→ Ag(s)
Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 2 Balance the electrons in each equation by
finding the lowest common multiple.
The silver half-equation only has one
electron, whereas the nickel half-equation
contains two electrons.
To balance the electrons, we need to multiply
the silver half-equation by 2.
2 × (Ag+(aq) + e–
2Ag+(aq) + 2e–
→ Ag(s))
→ 2Ag(s)
Step 3 Combine the half-equations by adding them
together. A simple way of doing this is to write
each species that is on the left of the arrow
of the half-equations together on the left and
write each species that is on the right of the
arrow of the half-equations together on the
right.
Note that it is important to place the arrows
directly below each other.
2Ag+(aq) + 2e–
→ 2Ag(s)
Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
_________________________________________
2Ag+(aq) + 2e– + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 4 The electrons on the left-hand side of the
arrow cancel out those on the right-hand
side, leaving the full balanced redox equation.
2Ag+(aq) + 2e– + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq) + 2e–
_________________________________________
2Ag+(aq) + Ni(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ni2+(aq)

equation that can also be classified as an ionic equation. It shows the species reacting and

Writing balanced half-equations from full redox reactions
Sometimes you may be given an ionic equation, or full redox equation, from which you
need to identify what the half-equations are. This involves applying most of the skills that
you have been looking at in this chapter. You will need to identify the redox couples and
follow the steps to balance each half-equation that were covered in Worked examples 3B–1,
3B–2 and 3B–3.
Worked example 3B–6: Writing half-equations from full equations
Use the following redox reaction to write the two half-reactions. Also identify which
half-reaction is reduction and which is oxidation.

NOTE
There is sometimes a rare case where the reduction and oxidation reactions both result in the
same product being formed. An example of this is shown below.
Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 4H+(aq) + 2SO4
2–(aq) → 2PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(l)
The redox couples for such a reaction would each have the same product as indicated below.
Pb + PbO2 + 4H+ + 2SO4
2– → 2PbSO4 + 2H2O
Sometimes it is possible for the opposite to happen, where the same species in a redox reaction
acts as both the reducing agent and the oxidising agent. In one half-reaction it would undergo
reduction, and in the other half-reaction it would undergo oxidation. These are uncommon
circumstances but are important to be aware of.

BALANCED
EQUATIONS
Key things to check when writing balanced equations
It is important that you are able to write balanced equations, particularly in this section
of the course. Below are a few points to remember that you may find helpful.
1 Never change the subscripted numbers in a formula. This is only done when balancing
the formula of ionic compounds based on the individual charges of the cation and the
anion.
2 Only ever change coeﬃcients to balance elements.
3 A balanced equation must have the same number of each element on both the
reactant and product sides.
4 Charges on both the reactant and product sides must always be the same. One
common mistake is adding electrons to each side of a redox equation to make the
charges equal zero on both sides. Sometimes the charges will be zero, other times
positive or negative. They simply need to be the same on each side.
5 Finally, always make sure that you add states to any equations you write.
Let’s look at an example to apply these rules.

96 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
In the 1840s, a telegraph system used an early version of an electric primary cell that
consisted of two half-cells, each with an electrode and an aqueous electrolyte, which
were:
• a zinc electrode (Zn) in dilute sulfuric acid solution (H2SO4).
• a platinum electrode (Pt) in concentrated nitric acid (HNO3).
In the nitric acid half-cell, aqueous nitrate ions, NO3
–, were converted into nitrogen
dioxide, NO2.
Write the half-equation for this reaction by following these steps.
1 Write the initial reactant and products without changing the subscripts present
NO3
–
⇌ NO2
2 Balance the elements by following the steps in KOHES, which will change the
coeﬃcients.
NO3
– + 2H+ ⇌ NO2 + H2O
3 Check that the same number of elements is present on both the reactant and product
sides of the equation – which they are.
4 The reactant side of the equation has an overall charge of +1 (–1 + 2), whereas the
product side of the equation has an overall charge of 0. Therefore, balance the charges
by adding electrons to the more positive side, in this case the reactant side (one
electron needed).

Batteries are everywhere!
In a world where technology is advancing and
the number of portable and mobile gadgets
is increasing, have you ever wondered when
batteries were first invented, or what is it about
a battery that makes it possible to provide the
electrical energy to power these devices?
There are many different types of batteries in
use today. Some larger batteries store huge
amounts of power generated by solar farms,
others may be used to power electric cars, while
many are much smaller and can be found in
Figure 3C–1 Italian scientist Alessandro
Volta and his voltaic pile ‘battery’
consisting of alternating silver and
zinc discs
watches and hearing aids. Despite their size
differences, essentially all of them have a similar design enabling a redox chemical
reaction to take place that converts stored chemical energy into usable electrical energy.
American scientist and inventor, Benjamin Franklin, first used the term ‘battery’ in
the mid-1700s but it is believed that the first true battery was made by Italian scientist
Alessandro Volta in 1800. He created a stack of alternating discs of silver and zinc,
separated by cloth soaked in salt water, to generate a current. Since there were
no instruments available to detect weak currents at the time, he tested his batteries by
using his tongue! Volta discovered that changing the types of metals used, as well as
changing the number of discs, had an effect on the amount of current that the battery
could produce.
Another battery that you might already be familiar with is the lead–acid battery, which
was invented in the mid-1800s. It was the first-ever rechargeable battery and is still
commonly used today to provide the electrical energy needed to start cars and other
vehicles. Batteries are examples of galvanic cells, which are central to this section of the
Study Design.

EXPLAIN
Electrochemical cells
Electrochemical cells are systems that can convert stored chemical energy into electrical
energy or that can use electrical energy supplied to facilitate chemical reactions. Some can
even do both! In this chapter, we will focus on the former, also referred to as ‘galvanic cells’.
Galvanic cells are one type of electrochemical cell and involve spontaneous redox reactions.
NOTE
It is helpful to recognise that there are a number of interchangeable terms used when discussing
galvanic cells: ‘voltaic cell’, ‘primary cell’ and even the term ‘battery’ may all be used to reference
a galvanic cell. Essentially, they are equivalent in that they refer to an electrochemical cell that
spontaneously produces electrical energy from chemical energy.

Figure 3C–2 shows the spontaneous

into a solution of copper(II) sulfate
containing copper ions, Cu2+(aq).
The overall redox reaction for this
process is:
Cu2+(aq) + Zn(s) → Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq)
Since the reactants are in direct
contact with each other, when the
reaction takes place, electrons are
exchanged directly in an exothermic
reaction, and chemical energy is
converted into thermal energy, which
is released into the surroundings
as heat.

that separate the two reactants instead of allowing them to be in direct contact with one
another. This allows for the transformation of chemical energy into electrical energy that
can be harnessed and used to provide power. Without this separation, a spontaneous
exothermic reaction would still occur, involving a direct exchange of electrons between
the reactants. This would produce heat energy instead of the electrical energy that can be
generated by a galvanic cell.

Features of galvanic cells
Galvanic cells are designed with a number of important features to ensure that electrical
energy can be produced. Figure 3C–3 shows a representation of a specific galvanic cell
called the Daniell cell, which was one of the first galvanic cells, invented by English
chemist John Daniell in 1836. It includes many of the essential features common to all
galvanic cells and is simple enough that you can reproduce it in the laboratory.

chemist, John Daniell
Half-cells
Galvanic cells are comprised of two half-cells, which must be separated in order to produce
electrical energy. In Figure 3C–3 above, the Daniell cell has two beakers separating the
reactants. Each half-cell contains a solid conducting electrode partially submerged in a
solution of ions. It is on the surface of these electrodes where the reduction and oxidation
reactions take place. From Section 3A, we know that reduction involves a ‘gain’ of electrons,
while oxidation involves the production or ‘loss’ of electrons. In a galvanic cell, the
electrode where reduction occurs is called the cathode, which is also the positive terminal of
the cell. The electrode where oxidation occurs is called the anode, which in a galvanic cell is
also the negative terminal of the cell. The positive or negative ‘charge’ on these electrodes is
more accurately referred to as the electrode polarity.
Electrodes
In Figure 3C–4, solid zinc, Zn(s), is acting as the anode in the oxidation half-cell, which
also contains a solution of zinc ions, Zn2+(aq). Solid copper, Cu(s), is the cathode in the
reduction half-cell, which also contains a solution of copper(II) ions, Cu2+(aq). You might
recognise the species in each half-cell as conjugate redox pairs. Each half-cell contains a
reducing agent and a conjugate oxidising agent. In most galvanic cells, a metal is part of
the conjugate redox pair and is therefore often used as an electrode. When this is the case,
the electrodes are reactive and take part in the redox reactions occurring. During such

reactions, it is possible to observe an increase in mass at the cathode, where ions are
converted to solid metal atoms (reduction occurs). Conversely, at the anode, where metal
atoms are converted into ions, it is possible to observe a decrease in the mass of the metal

Sometimes the conjugate redox pair in a half-cell does not include a metal, in which case
an inert electrode, such as graphite or platinum, may be used instead. These materials still
conduct electricity, but importantly, are not involved in the actual half-reactions that take
place on their surfaces. A final point worth noting about electrodes is that some half-
cells involving gases, such as hydrogen, oxygen or chlorine, may even have a special ‘gas
electrode’. Where the gas is a product of the reaction, there needs to be a way for the gas to
escape. If the gas is a reactant, however, it is usually necessary for the gas to be bubbled into
the solution surrounding the electrode. Figure 3C–5 shows an electrochemical cell that uses
these gas electrodes.

102 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
NOTE
Half-cells usually contain the species that react, but it is important to note that it is also possible for
other species that are not involved in the reaction to be present. Sometimes there may be multiple
ions present in a solution, often used to supply the reactive ions to the solution. For example, in the
Daniell cell, the copper ions are supplied by copper(II) sulfate. Sulfate ions, SO4
2– are also present
but would be considered spectator ions as they do not take part in the actual reaction.

1 It connects the circuit, allowing for the flow of charged particles through the circuit
2 It allows for the physical separation of half-cells, preventing reactants from coming into
direct contact with each other
3 It is usually soaked in a non-reactive electrolyte solution consisting of cations and anions
that can migrate into the solutions to balance the charges of the reaction occurring in
each half-cell (as shown in Figure 3C–4 with Na+ and Cl– ions).
Without a salt bridge, charge would accumulate in each of the cells and the redox reaction
would soon cease.
Two common electrolytes used in galvanic cells are concentrated potassium nitrate, KNO3,
and concentrated potassium chloride, KCl; however, other substances may also be used,
including sodium sulfate, Na2SO4, and sodium chloride, NaCl. Often the salt bridge is
simply a piece of filter paper soaked in the electrolyte and draped across the two solutions
in each beaker.
Migration of ions from the salt bridge
Consider the redox reactions taking place in the Daniell cell shown in Figure 3C–4.
Reduction at the cathode: Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Oxidation at the anode: Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e–
If we focus on the reduction reaction, we can see that it is using positive cations from the
solution and converting them to neutral solid metal atoms. As a result, those cations are
essentially removed from the solution as they take part in the reaction, so there would start
to be an imbalance between the cations and anions in the solution. To balance the charges,
positively charged cations from the salt bridge migrate into the solution of the reduction
half-cell. For example, if NaCl is the electrolyte solution being used in the cell, it would
be sodium ions, Na+, that migrate towards the cathode. It is important to note that this
‘balancing’ of charge is happening in real-time and that if it did not, the galvanic cell would
cease to function.
Looking at the anode reaction, the opposite is occurring, as solid zinc metal atoms are
oxidised to zinc ions, Zn2+. In this half-cell, the balance of charge in the solution would
start to shift to have more cations than anions, so to balance this change, negatively charged
anions migrate from the salt bridge towards the anode. If NaCl is the electrolyte solution
being used in the cell, it would mean chloride ions, Cl–, perform this function.

3C FEATURES OF GALVANIC CELLS

NOTE
An easy way to remember this movement of ions in the electrolyte (salt) bridge is:
– anions to the anode
– cations to the cathode.
As well as observing a change in mass at the cathode and anode, sometimes other
important observations can be made that provide some indication that a reaction is taking
place within a galvanic cell. In some half-cells, gases may be produced in a half-reaction
that result in bubbles forming on the surface of the electrode. Another observation might
be a change in appearance of the solvent used in a half-cell. For example, in the Daniell cell,
the copper(II) sulfate solution has a blue colour. However, as the reaction proceeds and
copper ions in that solution undergo reduction, the concentration of copper ions, Cu2+, will
decrease and the intensity of that blue coloured solution will also decrease over time.
The external circuit
The separation of reactants in a galvanic cell is crucial and allows the electrons produced
by oxidation at the anode to flow to the cathode where they then take part in the reduction
reaction. It is important to recognise that the electrons do not move into the solutions.
Instead, the electrons flow from one electrode to the other via the external circuit, which is
made up of wires connecting the electrodes. In some cell diagrams you may see light globes
used in place of the voltmeter shown in Figure 3C–3 or 3C–4, which would glow when
current flows through the external circuit.

NOTE
An important skill is to determine the direction of flow of electrons. Although it should be
possible to work out the direction by looking at the half-equations to see where the electrons
are being used and where they are being produced, another convenient way to remember the
direction is that they travel from the anode to the cathode (A to the C), which is in alphabetical
order.

104 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Drawing and labelling galvanic cell diagrams
A key skill is being able to use the information about a reaction taking place in a galvanic
cell to draw and/or label key aspects of the cell. This might include:
• writing the half-reactions or overall reaction occurring in the cell
• labelling the anode and cathode
• labelling the polarity of the electrodes
• labelling the direction of electron flow
• labelling the direction of flow of ions from the salt bridge.
Being able to determine many of these characteristics relies on identifying the cathode and
the anode. To assist with this, make use of the galvanic cell mnemonic (memory aid): the
Happy Red Cat.
• Happy corresponds to the positive terminal.
• Red corresponds to reduction.
• Cat corresponds to cathode.
In galvanic cells, these three aspects always combine in the reduction half-cell, so you only
need to identify one of the three aspects to quickly work out the other two. The opposite
holds true for the oxidation half-cell: negative, oxidation and anode.

Solution
Step 1 Logic There is no specific order in which to
approach a question like this, but the
key is to identify what information you
are given and to then try to apply the
‘happy red cat’ mnemonic.
By identifying the reactions shown
for each half-cell, and applying what
we already understand about redox
reactions, we can see the equation
on the left for zinc is producing two
electrons. Therefore, ‘E’ is oxidation.
We can also see that in the half-
reaction on the right the copper ions
are combining with two electrons,
which means that ‘I’ is reduction.
Process
Loss of electrons:
Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e–
Therefore, ‘E’ is oxidation.
Gain of electrons:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Therefore, ‘I’ is reduction.

106 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Step 2 We can then apply the ‘happy red cat’
to labels F and G.
Happy red cat:
Happy: positive
Red: reduction, which occurs on the
right-hand side.
Cat: cathode must also be on the
right-hand side.
Therefore, ‘F’ is cathode and ‘G’ is
positive.
Step 3 By elimination, this tells us which
terms correspond to labels B and C.
If ‘F’ is the cathode, ‘B’ is the anode
and ‘C’ is negative.
Step 4 The direction of electron flow can now
be determined, as we know electrons
flow from anode to the cathode (A to
the C).
Electrons flow from left to right in
this cell, so an arrow pointing right is
appropriate for ‘A’ on the diagram.
Step 5 For ion flow, we know that anions flow
to the anode and cations flow to the
cathode.
Because KNO3 is shown as the
electrolyte solution, the anions would
be nitrate ions, NO3
–, and the cations
would be potassium ions, K+. We can
now add these species to labels D and
H respectively.
Step 6 Complete the diagram. See below.

EXPLAIN
Potential difference
Under the same conditions, the type of reactants being used will influence the amount of
voltage that can be produced by a galvanic cell. The voltage produced is caused by the potential
difference in the amount of energy that the valence electrons have in atoms of different
elements. Electrons flow through the external circuit because of this difference in potential
energy between the two electrodes. More simply, the reactant in one half-cell has a stronger
tendency to move electrons through the circuit compared to the other half-cell. The greater
the difference between the two reactants, the greater the potential voltage the cell will be.

Figure 3D–1 Two similar galvanic cells. The voltage produced in the Daniell cell on the
left is 1.10 volts compared to the cell on the right, which can produce 2.62 volts under
the same conditions. In the cell on the right, the zinc half-cell has been replaced with a
magnesium half-cell.
On the Daniell cell represented in Figure 3D–1, on the left-hand side, the voltmeter measuring
the flow of electric current moving between the two half-cells shows that 1.10 volts is being
produced. In the cell shown on the right-hand side, the zinc half-cell has been substituted with
a magnesium half-cell. Under the same conditions, the second cell is able to produce 2.62 volts.
This difference is due to magnesium being more reactive and having a greater tendency to
move electrons through the external circuit compared to the zinc half-cell.
Standard electrode potential
Each half-cell has a unique standard electrode potential, which is the amount of voltage it
can produce at standard conditions. For these experiments, standard conditions refers to
a temperature of 25°C (298 K), solvent concentrations of 1 M and a pressure of 100 kPa.
As redox reactions involve both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously, it
is not possible to measure the electrode potential of one half-cell without connecting it
to another. Reduction occurs in one half-cell, while oxidation occurs simultaneously in
the other. For this reason, a standard hydrogen electrode has been used to determine the
comparative electrode potentials of other half-reactions – this is then referred to as their
standard electrode potentials.
The standard hydrogen electrode
The value of the standard electrode potential for different half-cells has been experimentally
determined using the standard hydrogen electrode as a reference. To develop the scale,
this half-cell was arbitrarily assigned an electrode potential of 0.00 volts under standard
conditions. Other half-cells were then measured against the standard hydrogen electrode to

voltage, or standard cell potential, that a particular galvanic cell can produce. This voltage
may also be referred to as electromotive force, or emf, and is measured in volts.

half-reaction listed highest on the electrochemical series. However, at the anode, oxidation
is taking place, not reduction, so this half-reaction must be reversed. Whenever a reaction

The oxidation reaction will be the one listed lowest on the electrochemical series, as shown:

FEATURES OF
ELECTROLYTIC
CELLS
LINK
To determine the overall cell potential, or voltage, that can be produced by the zinc–nickel
cell from page 112 under standard conditions, simply add the two standard electrode
potentials together:
–0.25 + (+0.76) = +0.51 volts
A positive value obtained for the cell potential indicates that the reaction is spontaneous,
which is expected in a galvanic cell. This is useful to remember when performing
calculations of cell potentials. A negative value would mean that the electrochemical cell is
an electrolytic cell, not a galvanic cell. Electrolytic cells are covered further in Section 7A.
NOTE
The values should only be added together if the half-equation and standard electrode potentials
are reversed for the anode half-reaction.
A useful way to calculate the cell potential directly from the electrochemical series, without
reversing equations and values, is to use the following rule:
E 0
cell = E 0
Reduction reaction – E 0
Oxidation reaction
In Figure 3D–3, notice that the reduction half-equation for nickel appears higher up in the
electrochemical series, compared to the oxidation reaction for zinc. This will be true for
ALL galvanic cells. This is another alternative way to remember which electrode potential
should be subtracted from the other when calculating cell potentials in galvanic cells, as in
the following rule:
E 0
cell = E 0
Higher half-reaction – E 0
Lower half-reaction
NOTE
As well as stressing the importance of always including units, it is essential to note that the value
for cell potential is directional, and the positive or negative sign must always be written in front
of the value to indicate this.

consisting of Au+(aq)/Au(s) and Ag+(aq)/Ag(s) half-cells.
Predicting redox reactions in galvanic cells
The electrochemical series can be used to help identify whether a reaction will occur
spontaneously. For a reaction to occur, the oxidising agent must be located higher on the
left-hand side of the series, compared to the reducing agent, which must be located lower
and on the right-hand side of the series. If the species are not positioned in this way, no
reaction will occur.

Solution
a Pb2+(aq) is the oxidising agent, as it is the species highest on the left-hand side and
Cd(s) is the reducing agent, as it is located lower on the right-hand side. As such they
will undergo a spontaneous reaction.
b No reaction will occur, since both species are oxidising agents and are both located
on the left-hand side of the electrochemical series.
c No reaction will occur, since Ni2+(aq), as the oxidising agent on the left-hand side is
lower than Pb2+(aq), which is the reducing agent, located higher on the right-hand side.
Identifying reactions using the
electrochemical series
The half-equations occurring in a galvanic cell are
not always provided. However, if all the species
present are known, the electrochemical series can
be used to identify the half-reactions occurring, to
then determine the overall redox reaction and to
calculate the cell potential for a given combination
of reactants. On the electrochemical series, the
species that is highest on the left-hand side of the
electrochemical series will undergo reduction.
The species that is lowest on the right-hand side
will undergo oxidation, meaning the reaction on
the electrochemical series for this half-reaction
must be written in reverse.

Step 1 Use the electrochemical series to

E 0 = –0.13
Step 2 The species highest on the left-hand
side will be the strongest oxidising
agent, and as such will undergo
reduction. In this example, silver
ions, Ag+ are the strongest oxidising
agent. The species lowest on the
right-hand side will be strongest
reducing agent, and as such will
undergo oxidation. In this example,
solid lead, Pb(s) is the strongest
reducing agent.

Step 3 Write the equations for reduction and
oxidation, remembering to reverse
the oxidation reaction, which is the
lower of the two. It is important to
note the use of correct arrows when
writing these half-equations. The
electrochemical series represents
each reduction half-equation with
equilibrium arrows because it can be
reversed, depending on what else it is
reacting with. However, when writing
half-equations for a particular cell, a
critical part of what we are predicting is
the direction in which these reactions
will occur, and hence the use of a solid
forward arrow is appropriate.
b Ag+(aq) + e–
E 0 = +0.80
→ Ag(s)
Pb(s) → Pb2+(aq) + 2e–
E 0 = +0.13
Step 4 To determine the cell potential, the
values in Step 3 can be added,
since the oxidation reaction and its
standard electrode potential have
been reversed.
Alternatively, the values can be
substituted straight into the following
equation from the electrochemical
series.
c +0.80 + (+0.13) = +0.93 volts
E 0
cell = E 0
Reduction reaction – E 0
Oxidation reaction
E 0
cell = +0.80 – (–0.13) = +0.93 volts
Step 5 Write the overall equation by
balancing electrons and combining
the half-equations. In this example,
there are two electrons in the oxidation
half-equation but only one electron
in the reduction half-equation, which
consequently needs to be doubled.
Now that the number of electrons is
the same on each side, the electrons
can be cancelled to leave the full
redox equation.
2 × (Ag+(aq) + e–
→ Ag(s))
2Ag+(aq) + 2e–
→ 2Ag(s)
Pb(s) → Pb2+(aq) + 2e–
2Ag+(aq) + Pb(s) → 2Ag(s) + Pb2+(aq)
Step 6 Add the cell potential value to the
overall equation, making sure to
include units (volts).
d 2Ag+(aq) + Pb(s) → 2Ag(s) + Pb2+(aq)
E0 = +0.93 volts
NOTE
The standard electrode potential indicates the potential for a reaction to occur – it is never
multiplied when calculating cell potentials.

Limitations of the electrochemical series
Recall that the electrochemical series was derived using standard laboratory conditions. This
means that unpredictable things may occur when a galvanic cell is placed under conditions
that vary significantly from SLC. Sometimes a different reaction may take place, or there may
in fact be no reaction at all, even if a reaction is predicted to occur spontaneously. Changing
the temperature from 25°C or using solutions that have a concentration different to 1 M, may
result in different reactions taking place. The increased concentration of one particular ion
may mean that it reacts instead of the ions predicted on the electrochemical series. This can
be seen when the electrode potential values, E0, are close together.
One final consideration is that the electrochemical series does not provide any indication
of the reaction rate. Sometimes reactions may be predicted to occur, but they may do so
very slowly. Sometimes reactions may be taking place at such a slow rate that they appear
not to react, even though the electrochemical series predicts that a reaction is taking place.
For example, observing a galvanic cell for 20 minutes may not be sufficient time to observe
products of reactions being formed or other changes expected in the half-cells. You will
study rates of reaction more in Section 5B.
Sometimes, as well as the same species appearing in multiple positions on the electrochemical
series, some half-reactions may also include multiple species. Two examples of this are
shown below where there are hydrogen ions, H+(aq) shown as part of the half-reaction. This
indicates that for the reaction to proceed, there must also be a suitable supply of hydrogen
ions, which would usually mean using an acidic solution. It is important to consider all species
when predicting whether reactions will occur, but also when predicting what the products of
a particular galvanic cell may be. Measuring pH changes or using acid–base indicators may be
one additional way to detect whether a reaction is taking place.

Predicting reactions with more than one type of ion present
In some galvanic cells, electrodes can be inert, in which case they are not considered
when trying to predict the reactions occurring. Similarly, solutions in each half-cell
may contain more than one type of reactive ion. In such cases, it is important to

SKILLS:
PREDICTING
REACTIONS WITH
MORE THAN ONE
TYPE OF ION
PRESENT
remember redox reactions will only occur between the strongest oxidising agent in the
reduction half-cell and the strongest reducing agent in the oxidation half-cell. If there are many ion species
present, only two will react, and the rest will be considered to be spectator ions.
Some species appear more than once on the electrochemical series on both the left-hand side and right-
hand side of the series. When predicting reactions, all occurrences of each species must be considered to
accurately identify the strongest reducing agent and strongest oxidising agent.
Further consideration should also be given regarding what would happen in a galvanic cell where one of
these ions is completely used up by the reaction. If one completely reacts, the next strongest species will
start to react, provided there is another species available. There would be a decrease in the amount of
voltage produced, but it is important to recognise that whenever other species are present, the reaction
may not simply ‘stop’.
The example below highlights a type of question where more than one type of ion is present, as well as the
worked solution for this example.
Question
A galvanic cell consists of one half-cell with an inert platinum, Pt(s), electrode in a 1 M solution of
Cu2+(aq), Zn2+(aq) and Ni2+(aq) ions. The other half-cell has a solid iron electrode, Fe(s), in a 1 M solution
containing iron(II) ions, Fe2+(aq).
a Identify the strongest reducing agent and oxidising agent.
b State which electrode is the anode, and which is the cathode.
c Write the half-reactions occurring initially at the anode and cathode.
d Calculate the standard cell potential.
e Explain what you would expect to observe at the cathode over time.
Solution
Logic Process
Step 1 Use the electrochemical series to
highlight all the reactive species
present. It is often useful to highlight
the species present in one half-cell
differently from those in the other.
This can make it easier to identify
the reduction and oxidation
reactions that will take place.
The species highest on the left-hand
side of a reaction arrow will be the
strongest oxidising agent.
The species lowest on the right-
hand side of a reaction arrow will be
the strongest reducing agent.

120 CHAPTER 3 GALVANIC CELLS
Step 2 To identify the cathode, apply the
‘happy red cat’. Given that the iron
electrode is the strongest reducing
agent, undergoing oxidation, it
must be the anode. Therefore, the
strongest oxidising agent, copper
ions undergo reduction in the other
half-cell, where platinum is the
electrode, the cathode must be
platinum.
b Anode: Fe(s)
Cathode: Pt(s)
Step 3 Having identified the strongest
oxidising agent, Cu2+(aq) and
strongest reducing agent, Fe(s),
use the electrochemical series
to write the equations for each
species, remembering to reverse the
oxidation reaction, being the lower
of the two.
c Reduction: Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
→ Cu(s)
Oxidation: Fe(s) → Fe2+(aq) + 2e–
Step 4 Substitute the values straight into
the following equation from the
electrochemical series.
d E 0
cell = E 0
Reduction reaction – E 0
Oxidation reaction
E 0
cell = +0.34 – (–0.44) = +0.78 volts
Step 5 Write your explanation of what
you would expect, given the cell
potential.
e At the cathode:
Initially copper ions, Cu2+(aq) would be reduced to solid
copper, Cu(s). This would appear as a thin coating on
the surface of the platinum electrode. The mass of the
electrode would be increasing. Over time, all the copper
ions may react. At this point, the next strongest oxidising
agent present in the half-cell solution would be nickel
ions, Ni2+(aq), which would be reduced to solid nickel,
Ni(s). This would create another thin layer on the platinum
electrode, over the top of the copper layer and would result
in a further increase in mass of the electrode. During this
time, the cell potential would be reduced to +0.19 volts.
E 0
cell = –0.25 – (–0.44) = +0.19 volts
Once all of the nickel ions have reacted, the reaction would cease to produce any electrical energy since the
remaining ions at the cathode are zinc ions, Zn2+(aq), and these occur lower on the electrochemical series
than the strongest reducing agent, which is still Fe(s).

TARGET: Break down relationships, make judgments, assess validity.
TEST: Can student compare, contrast, infer, critique, or synthesise?
QUESTION TYPES: Compare/contrast, identify relationships, evaluate claims, infer from data, critique reasoning.
STEMS: "Which conclusion is supported by...", "Compare X and Y...", "The evidence suggests...", "Evaluate the claim that..."
REQUIRE: Multi-step reasoning. May include data, scenarios, or competing claims to evaluate.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
