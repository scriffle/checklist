      "correct": "If any element changes oxidation number during the reaction, it is redox",
      "correctExplanation": "A redox reaction involves electron transfer, which is reflected by a change in oxidation number for at least one element. No change means no redox.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "If the reaction produces a gas, it is always a redox reaction", "explanation": "Gas production can occur in non-redox reactions (e.g., acid + carbonate → CO₂). Gas production alone does not indicate redox." },
        { "answer": "If the reaction involves ions in solution, it is always a redox reaction", "explanation": "Many ionic reactions (e.g., precipitation, neutralisation) involve ions but no oxidation number changes." },
        { "answer": "If the reaction is exothermic, it is always a redox reaction", "explanation": "Non-redox reactions (e.g., neutralisation) can also be exothermic. Energy change does not determine redox." }

      "correct": "Acid-base neutralisation: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Metal displacement: Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu", "explanation": "Zn changes from 0 to +2 and Cu from +2 to 0. This is a redox reaction." },
