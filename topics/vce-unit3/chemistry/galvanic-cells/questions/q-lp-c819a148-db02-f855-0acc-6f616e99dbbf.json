      "correct": "To prevent direct contact between reactants and force electrons through the external circuit",
      "correctExplanation": "Separating the half-cells prevents direct electron transfer between reactants. Instead, electrons must travel through the external wire, producing usable electrical energy.",
      "distractors": [
