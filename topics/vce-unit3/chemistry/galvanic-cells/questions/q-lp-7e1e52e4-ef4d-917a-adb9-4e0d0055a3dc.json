      "correct": "Add the same number of OH⁻ ions to both sides as there are H⁺ ions",
      "correctExplanation": "To convert from acidic to basic conditions, add OH⁻ ions equal in number to the H⁺ ions on both sides, so they can combine to form water.",

        {
          "answer": "Replace all H⁺ ions directly with OH⁻ ions on the same side",

        {
          "answer": "Remove all H⁺ ions from the equation entirely",

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Why is the basic conditions method needed instead of just using KOHES directly?",
      "correct": "Because KOHES uses H⁺ ions, which are not abundant in basic solutions",

          "answer": "Because electrons behave differently in basic solutions than in acidic",

      "correct": "No, the standard conversion gives CrO₄²⁻ + 4H₂O + 3e⁻ → Cr³⁺ + 8OH⁻, not Cr(OH)₃ + 5OH⁻",
      "correctExplanation": "Add 8OH⁻ to both sides: left gets 8H₂O, right gets 4H₂O + 8OH⁻. Cancel 4H₂O: 4H₂O left. Product remains Cr³⁺, not Cr(OH)₃.",
      "distractors": [

      "correct": "Yes, both have the same E° because they represent the same overall electron transfer",
