      "why": "Identifying the limiting reagent is essential for calculating actual product yields, determining if combustion is complete or incomplete, and understanding fuel efficiency.",
      "example": "If 2.0 mol of methane reacts with 6.0 mol of oxygen, the equation requires 2 mol O2 per 1 mol CH4, so 2.0 mol CH4 needs 4.0 mol O2. Since 6.0 mol O2 is present, methane is limiting and oxygen is in excess.",
