      "correct": "Photosynthesis absorbs energy to form glucose while combustion releases that energy",
      "correctExplanation": "These are approximate reverses: photosynthesis stores energy in glucose bonds, combustion releases it.",

        { "answer": "Both reactions absorb exactly the same amount of energy from the environment", "explanation": "They have opposite energy flows; photosynthesis absorbs while combustion releases." },
        { "answer": "Both reactions release exactly the same amount of energy to the environment", "explanation": "Photosynthesis absorbs energy; only combustion releases energy to the environment." },
        { "answer": "They use different reactants so they cannot be compared as reverse reactions", "explanation": "The reactants of one are the products of the other, making them chemically reversible." }

      "correct": "Reaction X transfers more heat to the surroundings per mole than Reaction Y",
      "correctExplanation": "The magnitude of delta-H for X (890) is larger than Y (286), so X releases more heat per mole.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Reaction Y transfers more heat to the surroundings per mole than X does", "explanation": "The magnitude for Y is smaller, meaning it releases less heat per mole." },

      "question": "A student argues that endothermic reactions violate conservation of energy because products have more energy. How should this be critiqued?",
      "correct": "The extra energy in products came from the surroundings so total energy is conserved",
      "correctExplanation": "Energy absorbed from surroundings accounts for higher product energy; total energy is constant.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The argument is valid because products cannot have more energy than reactants", "explanation": "Products can have more energy if that energy was absorbed from the surroundings." },

      "correct": "Methane releases more energy per mole, producing 890 kJ versus 286 kJ",
      "correctExplanation": "Per mole, methane releases significantly more energy, making it more energy-dense on a molar basis.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Hydrogen releases more energy per mole, producing 286 kJ versus 890", "explanation": "286 kJ is less than 890 kJ, so hydrogen releases less energy per mole." },
        { "answer": "Both fuels release equivalent energy because both undergo combustion only", "explanation": "Different fuels have different delta-H values and release different energy amounts." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Correct; all exothermic reactions proceed without any initial energy input", "explanation": "Many exothermic reactions require ignition or a catalyst to overcome the energy barrier." },

      "correctExplanation": "A greater temperature increase in the same mass of water means more heat was released.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Reaction B released more heat energy to the water than Reaction A did", "explanation": "A smaller temperature rise means less energy was transferred to the water." },
        { "answer": "Both reactions released the same heat but Reaction A had less water", "explanation": "The problem states equal water masses, so the difference is energy released." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The spark provides all the energy and the gas contributes no energy at all", "explanation": "The spark only initiates the reaction; the vast majority of energy comes from combustion." },
