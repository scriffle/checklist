      "correctExplanation": "Correlation between biofuel production and food prices suggests competition for agricultural land diverts crops from food to fuel.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Biofuel production has no connection to food prices because they use different crop types", "explanation": "Students may not know that crops like corn and wheat are used for both food and biofuel." },
