TITLE: I can write and interpret the balanced equation for photosynthesis
CODE: 1B.2

WHAT (concept explanation):
The photosynthesis equation is 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(l) → C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(g), requiring light energy and chlorophyll. It shows the mole ratio of 6:6:1:6 for reactants and products.

WHY (importance):
This equation allows calculation of reactant requirements and product yields, and demonstrates the stoichiometric relationships in biological energy transformation.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
To produce 180 g of glucose (1 mol), plants require 264 g of carbon dioxide (6 mol) and 108 g of water (6 mol), releasing 192 g of oxygen (6 mol).

SUBTOPIC: Chemical Energy in Nature
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic examines how plants and animals produce and transform energy through photosynthesis and cellular respiration. It covers the chemical equations, conditions, and relationship between these complementary biological processes.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: These processes form the foundation of energy flow in ecosystems and are the basis for all biofuels. Understanding them connects light energy to usable chemical energy and explains how organisms meet their energy needs.

TOPIC: Carbon-Based Fuels
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Exploration of fossil fuels and biofuels, their production, renewability, and energy transformations. Includes photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and thermochemical analysis of combustion reactions.

Introduction
This chapter begins your exploration of energy and some of the different types of
fuel used to generate energy for society. You will compare various types of fossil
fuels and biofuels, including how they are sourced, produced and used in society,
while understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each. You will also look
at the processes by which plants and animals convert the energy contained within
light and food into usable forms of chemical energy. You will learn about reactions that
either release or absorb heat energy, as well as how to represent these diagrammatically.
Finally, you will look at calculating the quantity of energy released from the combustion
of fuels and explore the concepts of limiting and excess reagents for these types of reactions.

ENGAGE
Australia’s first petrol-driven car
When Harley Tarrant was young, his
father owned the Clunes Gazette, the
St Kilda Chronicle and the Prahran
Chronicle. As such, Harley was
surrounded by information from overseas
publications, and from these articles he
learned about, and became obsessed
with, cars.
Later, when working on the Nullarbor
Plain as a surveyor, he determined
that steam and electric vehicles would
not be suitable to tackle the harsh
Australian outback. In 1897, he decided
to build a kerosene engine with bicycle-
maker, Howard Lewis. Due to the high

the first two-seater, two-cylinder petrol engine
automobile built and sold in Australia, by
Harley Tarrant and Howard Lewis in 1901.
temperature at which kerosene vaporises,
it was not suitable as a fuel for a car engine, but it was ideal for pumping water. His engine
sold extremely well across Australia, providing him funding to continue working on a
suitable fuel and engine for an automobile.
Following this, Tarrant and Lewis set out to build their own petrol-driven car, which
used an imported Benz engine. After successfully developing a two-cylinder petrol
motor car in 1901, they refined it further with their own locally made engine. At the
time, they decided to sacrifice speed for a car that would thrive in Australian conditions.
Since then, and especially recently, the use of different fuels has continued to evolve
from fossil fuels to biofuels, and now the push to fully electric vehicles. Fossil fuels and
biofuels, with a focus on their renewability, are discussed further in this section.

EXPLAIN
What are fuels and why do we need them?
Likely, when you hear the word ‘fuel’, you think about petrol, diesel or coal used to power
planes, trains and automobiles. However, as you will see later in this chapter, food, such as
sugar, is also used as a fuel for our bodies.
Fuels are both organic and inorganic substances capable of storing chemical energy. In this
section, we will look at only organic fuels. As you will see in Section 1C, when a fuel is
burned, the stored chemical energy is released as heat (thermal) energy, which can then be
further used to power objects.
You should be familiar with the units of energy from earlier years in science. The
International System of Units (SI) unit for energy is the joule, J.
Fossil fuels
Fossil fuels are mostly hydrocarbons, with some other minor impurities, as you learned
about in Unit 1 and will learn more about in Unit 4. They are called ‘fossil’ fuels, as they
are formed through the fossilised remains and subsequent decay of plants, animals and
microorganisms, which lived millions of years ago. The hydrocarbon remains are extracted
through mining and the drilling of wells both on land and at sea. These remains still contain
some of the chemical energy that the plants, and the plants consumed by animals at the
time, originally stored from transforming light energy from the Sun when carrying out
photosynthesis. Photosynthesis as a chemical process will be covered further in Section 1B.
Fossil fuels are non-renewable, meaning their availability is limited and they are being
consumed at a rate faster than they are being produced. As these fossil fuels are formed over
millions of years, once they are depleted, they will not be replaced any time soon.
Fossil fuels can be separated into three main categories: coal, natural gas and petroleum.

Coal
Coal is a layer of sedimentary rock formed underground, containing mostly plant remains,
that are then buried by further sediments. It is formed under low oxygen conditions at
high temperatures and pressures over millions of years. Coal formations are called ‘coal
beds’ and they exist globally. The deeper the coal bed, the higher its rank, where the
ranking is based on how much it has changed over time. Deeper underground, the plant
matter experiences higher temperatures and pressures, and so more of the plant remains
are transformed into carbon, while water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane
(CH4) escape. The methane that is produced is trapped as coal seam gas. The higher the
percentage of carbon, the better the coal fuel source.

Coal is the most abundant of the fossil fuels and is the largest fuel source used for
generating electricity in the world. Coal is Australia’s largest energy resource. It is mined in
every state in Australia, with the largest black coal resources located in New South Wales
and Queensland. As Figure 1A–3 shows, black coal is buried deeper than other layers of
coal, but because of the heat efficiency it provides, it is much more economical for mining.
Approximately 70% of the coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to eastern Asian
regions. In 2019, pre-COVID, coal exploration expenditure was $229 million, which was
an increase of 32% from 2018. In comparison, the combustion of brown coal produces
approximately 85% of Australia’s electricity.

Fracking

Natural gas
Natural gas is mostly methane (CH4), with traces of other small hydrocarbons, such as
ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10). Other substances including water,
carbon dioxide, sulfur and nitrogen can also be present in the gas reservoirs.
You will recall that in the formation of coal, the increased pressure and temperature
resulted in the physical and chemical change of the sedimentary rock, releasing methane,
carbon dioxide and water.
Likewise, this pressure causes the natural gas found in rock formations to adsorb to the
surface of the coal. When drilling wells fracture coal deposits, natural gas flows to the
surface, as shown in Figure 1A–4. This process is called fracking. A fracking fluid is injected
into the well to increase the permeability of the sediment, allowing an easier flow of gas to
the surface. The fracking fluid contains sand, water and other chemicals. A chemical once
used in fracking fluid was benzene, which you will learn about in Section 8B. However, this
has been banned in Australia because it is carcinogenic, and there is a potential risk of it
escaping and contaminating water supplies. Sand is convenient as a component of this fluid
because it is often present at the site of drilling. However, water is not, and so this has to
be transported to the drilling sites, which is environmentally unfriendly and economically
costly.
One of the environmental concerns associated with fracking is that it releases methane, a
greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. It is predicted that approximately 4–8% leaks to the
atmosphere from the well head, pipelines and storage facilities.

Petroleum
In Unit 1, you learned about crude oil as being a mixture of predominantly alkanes, which
are organic hydrocarbon molecules. Like coal and natural gas, crude oil is formed from
plant and animal remains that decay over millions of years. However, crude oil is not as
widespread or as easy to access as coal and natural gas.
Crude oil is essentially petrol (petroleum). However, because the crude oil mixture contains
many hydrocarbons with varying sizes (based on their number of carbon atoms), it is not
useful to mine and use directly once drilled and brought to the surface. The crude oil
first needs to be separated into its various hydrocarbon fractions in a process called
fractional distillation.
Fractional distillation works on the fundamental basis that different-sized hydrocarbons
can be separated from each other because of their different boiling points, something you
learned in Unit 1 and will again cover in Section 10B. Countries in the Middle East are the
main sources and exporters of crude oil, including petrol, internationally. Australia, being
one of their trade partners, imports 90% of all the crude oil it uses. Australia does have a few
small crude oil reserves off the coast of northern Western Australia, South Australia and
Bass Strait; however, these are likely to be depleted by 2100.

Biofuels
While fossil fuels take millions of years to produce, and are being used up at a faster rate
than which they are being replenished, biofuels are the opposite. Biofuels are classified
as renewable because they can be produced at the same rate at which they are consumed.
As the name suggests, they are produced from living (hence, bio) matter, called biomass.
There are three types of biofuels covered in this chapter: biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel.
Figure 1A–5 shows the proportion of feedstocks in total biofuel production. As you will see

Biogas
Biogas is formed from the breakdown of organic biological waste, such as plant matter,
by anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria are those that thrive in the absence of oxygen.
The bacteria break down complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose and starch, as well as
proteins, into simpler molecules. The contents and percentage of these simpler molecules
will depend on the starting organic material that is being decomposed. Approximate
percentages are shown in Table 1A–1.

As you can see from the biogas cycle shown in Figure 1A–6, the original solar energy is
captured by crops and transformed into chemical energy by photosynthesis, which will
be explored in Section 1B. For large-scale production, the organic waste produced from
harvesting crops, food waste and animal by-products is placed in a large tank called a
digester. The digester is filled with anaerobic bacteria. Waste from this process can be used
as a good biofertiliser and the biogas produced is useful for heating and electricity in homes
and farms. This cycle further highlights the renewability and low impact of greenhouse
gas emissions for this process.

large-scale biogas plant was announced for Nowra, in NSW. According to the Australian
Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), the estimated biogas potential would place Australia
on par with Germany, a leading country in the production of biogas.

Ethanol can be manufactured by the addition reaction of ethene with steam. You will
encounter this reaction again in Section 9A.
More commonly and naturally, ethanol is produced in plants and yeast that undergo
anaerobic fermentation. Typical crops grown globally for ethanol production include corn,
maize and wheat, but Australia has a long history of fermenting native plants. The Palawa
people of Tasmania have a history of using the sap of a cider gum to make the sweet
fermented drink wayalinah, and the Noongar people in south-western Australia have
fermented the fruit of the macrozamia plant (known as by-yu or kwineen) as a method of
detoxification and to enhance its nutritional value.

The main feedstock used in Australia for producing bioethanol is wheat. Facilities are
currently located in both New South Wales and Queensland, with plans for a large-scale
facility to operate in regional Victoria in the future.
In wheat and other first-generation feedstocks, biological catalysts called enzymes speed
up the breakdown of cellulose and starch to sucrose. Yeast is then added to this solution.
The yeast contains another enzyme called invertase, which helps convert the sucrose into
glucose. The glucose then binds with another enzyme in the yeast called zymase, which
assists the final step of fermentation into ethanol (bioethanol) and carbon dioxide according
to the following equation.
glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide
C6H12O6(aq) → 2CH3CH2OH(aq) + 2CO2(g)
Notice that the ethanol produced from fermentation is in an aqueous (aq) state. This
means that it is not pure and is hydrated by water molecules. These water molecules are
removed by distillation, which will be covered in more detail in Section 10B.

If you’ve got your learner permit or probationary licence and have driven to fill the car up
at the petrol station, you will have noticed the fuel pump labelled ‘E10’. It is called E10 as
it contains a blend of 90% petrol and 10% ethanol. The addition of ethanol to petrol has
several advantages, including:
• the use of petrol derived from crude oil is reduced
• the fuel is oxygenated so that it burns more completely
• the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is reduced
• the source of the bioethanol makes it a more sustainable transport fuel.
Biodiesel
Biodiesel is a mixture of organic compounds produced from vegetable oils, cooking oils
and animal fats. Because it is produced from plant and/or animal products, it is renewable
and often called ‘green diesel’. A transesterification reaction between plant and/or animal
triglycerides (fats, oils) and alcohol, typically methanol (CH3OH), results in a mixture
of methyl esters, or biodiesel. You will learn more about transesterification reactions in
Section 9B; however, an example reaction is shown in Figure 1A–8 below. Note that this
reaction also requires the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
acting as a catalyst. Biodiesel production in this way requires less energy and has less
emissions than producing bioethanol.

The other product in the transesterification reaction, glycerol, is commonly used in the

If you look back at Figure 1A–5 on page 10, you will see that a large number of the
feedstocks used in biofuel production are vegetable oils, used for biodiesels.
There are currently three biodiesel plants operating in Australia. However, after peaking in
the mid-2010s, they now operate at less than 40% capacity. With only around 0.2% blend
rate with standard diesel, it is a fuel with very little focus in Australia. Globally, biodiesel
can be used in most existing diesel engines without them needing further modifications.
Like bioethanol, these blends are also labelled at the pump, typically as B5 or B20,
indicating a 5% or 20% blend, respectively, of biodiesel with standard diesel.

Comparing fossil fuels and biofuels
In this chapter so far, you have learned about six different types of fuels. Three of these
were fossil fuels and three were biofuels. Table 1A–3 highlights the key comparisons of
these with a focus on their renewability and societal impacts.
Table 1A–3 Advantages and disadvantages of the different types of fossil fuels and biofuels
Advantages Fuel type Disadvantages
Fossil fuels
(non-renewable)
Coal • Mined easily
• Large reserves remaining
• Cheap
• Can be converted to liquid and
gas fuel, which is more portable
if oil runs out
• Traces of sulfur and nitrogen react with
atmospheric O2 to form SO2 and NO2,
which contribute to acid rain.
• Finite supply so will eventually run out
Natural gas • Moderate cost for consumers
• Easily converted to methanol
• Produces least pollution
• Limited reserves remaining
• Economically expensive to harness
and transport
• Environmental concerns over fracking
Petrol • Easily transported
• Less pollution than coal
• Many applications
• Limited reserves remaining globally,
and availability will decline within
decades
• Expensive
• Mining is destroying ecosystems
(both on and offshore)
Biofuels
(renewable)
Biogas • Derived from plants, animals
and humans
• Utilisation of waste for heating,
electricity and fertilisers, rather
than letting it rot in landfills
• Produces a circular economy
• Good alternative for electricity
and heating in rural areas or
developing countries
• Very few technological advancements,
so additional research and government
funding required to make production
efficient
• Anaerobic digestion occurs optimally
at 37°C, so in colder climates heat
energy is required to generate biogas
continually.
• Odour is emitted from digesters used in
this process, so a need to build these
in locations away from residences
Bioethanol • Reduces greenhouse gas
emissions, as crops used for
fuel production absorb the CO2
they emit when burned
• Combining with oil extends the
longevity of limited crude oil
supplies
• Production requires large volumes of
water.
• The food vs fuel debate of growing
crops
Biodiesel • New land not required for
production
• Reduces hydrocarbon
emissions and the lifecycle of
greenhouse gases
• Reduces smog thereby
reducing atmospheric pollution
• Farmland used for growing fuel instead
of food
• Large volumes of water (or availability)
and fertilisers required

1A TYPES OF FUELS
15
While biofuels might seem like a better alternative to fossil fuels, their increasing use in
the immediate future raises a number of other important implications that need to be
considered and managed, including:
• how much land degradation and forest destruction occurs to grow crops
• the percentage of crops grown for fuel versus that grown for food to meet the needs of
increasing population sizes.
Research is underway to look at the potential for either algae or agave crops to be used as a
feedstock for biodiesel production. The latter thrives in dry, arid desert environments with
little water and produces a high oil yield. Therefore, land required for growing food would
not be compromised.

BASED
QUESTIONS
Comparison-based questions
In this section, you were presented with six different types of fuels. You learned
about how and where each was sourced from, the chemical processes used in their
production and their respective advantages and disadvantages. As such, it is predictable
that assessment questions will require you to compare various aspects of different
combinations of these fuels. In comparison or contrast questions, you are required to
explain both the similarities and differences of each item in the question. Let’s look at an
example question, which has been adapted from the 2021 VCAA Exam and solution.
Question
Digesters use bacteria to convert organic waste into biogas. Both biogas and coal seam
gas have the same hydrocarbon as their main component. Referring specifically to this
hydrocarbon, compare biogas and coal seam gas.
VCAA 2021
Answer
Similarities:
Both are types of fuels that contain mainly methane, CH4.
Differences:
• Coal seam gas is non-renewable as it originally comes from the increased
temperature and pressure experienced by sedimentary rock deeper below Earth’s
surface and is not produced at a rate equal to or faster than it is consumed.
• On the other hand, biogas is renewable, as it is produced from the breakdown of plant
matter, in particular cellulose and starch, by bacteria under anaerobic conditions.
Notice that in this answer, the comparison word ‘whereas’ was used to differentiate
between the difference of the two fuels.
This was just one example for two fuels covered in this chapter, but other examples
may require you to compare two different types of fossil fuels or two different types of
biofuels, the advantages and/or disadvantages of different fuels or their renewability.
Developing a clear set of notes with what makes each distinct from the other will be
important for this section.

The carbon economy
Have you heard of the carbon economy? Perhaps you’re more familiar with the term
‘carbon footprint’. Both of these relate to carbon dioxide emissions. As you learned in
Unit 2, carbon dioxide emissions (a type of greenhouse gas) are primarily responsible
for global warming and climate change. Carbon dioxide is released naturally through
processes like cellular respiration, which you will learn more about in this chapter,
and fermentation. However, other human activities, such as deforestation and the
burning of fossil fuels, which you will learn more about in Section 1C, have been the
main producers of the gas. For decades, efforts have been made to monitor and lower
these emissions. Governments and industries are continually improving the efficiency
of photosynthesis, which is the way carbon dioxide is naturally removed from the
atmosphere. The benefits of this improvement will be twofold. The world’s population
is growing rapidly and greater quantities of food will be needed to support future
generations. Not only will there be less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but it is
thought that increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis will mean more nutrient-rich
crops and increased crop yields. Governments and industries also want to increase
the production of biomass, a sustainable and renewable energy resource, in the hope
that this will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and again reduce the volume of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.

Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is an anabolic chemical reaction in which the Sun’s light energy is used to
convert the inorganic compounds carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into the organic
compound glucose (C6H12O6). Glucose can then be used as a source of energy by the cells
of living organisms, enabling growth and reproduction.
Photosynthesis consists of a series of steps (a biochemical pathway), with each step
controlled by a different enzyme. The overall process of photosynthesis can be written as
both a word equation and a balanced chemical equation:
carbon dioxide + water oxygen + glucose

The oxygen released is

from a photosynthesis
perspective. However, this
is a very important reactant
for cellular respiration in both
plants and animals. The glucose
produced from photosynthesis
in plants is the key reactant
required for cellular respiration
in living organisms, as you
will see later in this chapter.
As you learned in Section 1A,
glucose is also the key input for
fermentation in the production
of bioethanol from plants
and yeast.
Photosynthesis is an example
of an endothermic reaction,
which you will learn about in

Check-in questions – Set 1
1 What is the purpose of photosynthesis?
2 a Write the word equation for photosynthesis.
b Write the simplified balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis.
Cellular respiration
Like photosynthesis, cellular respiration occurs as a series of steps in a biochemical
pathway, with each step controlled by a different enzyme. You do not need to be familiar
with any of these steps in this chemistry course. The purpose of cellular respiration is the
catabolic breakdown of glucose, which releases the chemical energy in a form more usable
for cells, as a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
There are two types of cellular respiration. The first occurs in the absence of oxygen
(anaerobic) and is commonly referred to as fermentation. You learned about this in
Section 1A. This occurs in certain plants and yeast, resulting in the production of ethanol
(bioethanol) and carbon dioxide, according to the following equation:
glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide
C6H12O6(aq) → 2CH3CH2OH(aq) + 2CO2(g)
In animals, a slightly different form of anaerobic cellular respiration takes place. It is often
called lactic acid fermentation and results in the production of lactic acid (lactate ions),
which is associated with muscle cramping. This chemical reaction is represented according
to the following equation:

The second form of cellular respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen (aerobic). This
occurs in many plant and animal cells with some steps occurring inside the mitochondria,
the energy powerhouse of the cell. Aerobic cellular respiration results in a much greater
yield of energy per mole of glucose than that yielded by anaerobic cellular respiration.

You will recall from Unit 2, and this will again be covered in Section 3A, that oxidation
means a loss of electrons. If you look at the oxidation numbers, in red, shown above the
balanced chemical equation, you will see that the carbon changes from a ‘0’ to a ‘+4’
oxidation number. This means it is losing electrons. Conversely, the oxygen gas reactant is
being reduced, as it changes oxidation number from ‘0’ to ‘+2’.
As glucose can be broken down to release the energy required for all metabolic reactions
occurring in our bodies’ cells, it is a type of fuel. Like the other fuels you learned about in
Section 1A, it undergoes a combustion reaction that releases energy, which means it is an
exothermic reaction. Exothermic combustion reactions will be discussed in more detail in
Section 1C.
As in photosynthesis, there are many factors which affect the rate of cellular respiration
reactions, such as temperature, glucose availability, oxygen concentration and enzyme
(catalyst) concentration. Factors affecting the frequency and success of collisions between
reactants, and the subsequent rate of chemical reactions, are explored further in Section 5B.

Figure 1B–4 The complementary nature of the photosynthesis and cellular respiration reactions
means that carbon, hydrogen and oxygen cycle through organisms and their environments continually.
Referring to Figure 1B–4, note the following key points.
• Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, an organelle found only in the cells of green
plants and algae.
• The products of photosynthesis (oxygen and glucose) are used as reactants in the
process of aerobic cellular respiration.
• Aerobic cellular respiration occurs mostly in mitochondria, organelles found in
animal, plant and fungal cells, and protists.
• Aerobic cellular respiration uses the products of photosynthesis to produce ATP,
an energy storage molecule, which can then release energy to meet the cell’s
requirements.
• In plants, the products of aerobic cellular respiration (water and carbon dioxide) can
then be used as reactants in the process of photosynthesis.
• Although photosynthesis appears to be the reverse of cellular respiration, the
processes are different and use different enzymes. (You will learn in general about
enzymes in Section 12B.)
Using the Study Design to guide your preparation
The most important way of determining the detail you need to know is by looking at
the Study Design and completing many practice questions. Keep focused on the terms
used in the Study Design dot points and, when making notes, always use the dot points,
or part of the dot points, as your headings. The Study Design was written specifically to
cover what you need to know, and the success criteria have been written to guide you
through the necessary material.
For example, the Study Design requires you to know that photosynthesis is a source of
both glucose and oxygen, which are required for respiration in living things, and that it is
in these living things where the glucose is oxidised as the primary energy source.

1C EXOTHERMIC AND ENDOTHERMIC REACTIONS
25
EXPLAIN
Exothermic and endothermic reactions
For a chemical reaction to occur, the bonds within the reactants must first be broken.
This requires energy and the exact quantity of energy is specific for each reaction. Every
reaction has a minimum amount of energy that is needed for the reaction to occur –
this is known as the activation energy and is represented by the symbol E
. As a reaction
a
proceeds, new bonds must be formed to generate the products. Unlike breaking bonds,
this process releases energy. This can be summarised by the following statements:
Breaking bonds: requires energy from the environment
Forming bonds: releases energy to the environment
The chemical energy of a substance is called its enthalpy or heat content and has the
symbol H. The overall change in energy from reactants to products is known as the
enthalpy change (ΔH). The enthalpy change indicates whether more energy was required
to break the reactant bonds than was released forming the product bonds or vice versa. It
can be represented by the equation:
Δ H(reaction) = Σ H(reactant bonds broken) – Σ H(product bonds formed)
From this equation, we can see that there are two possible outcomes.
1 The energy required to break the bonds of the reactants is greater than the energy
released from forming the bonds in the products. In this instance, the ΔH will be
positive, and the reaction is referred to as an endothermic reaction.
2 The energy required to break the bonds of the reactants is less than the energy released
from forming the bonds in the products. In this instance, the ΔH will be negative, and
the reaction is referred to as an exothermic reaction.
Exothermic and endothermic reactions can be illustrated using energy profile diagrams
(Figure 1C–1).

Calculating the value for the enthalpy change of a reaction can be important in
understanding the energy content of fuels and foods. This will be covered in more depth
in Section 2B.
It is important to note that in an exothermic reaction, where the ΔH is negative, the
products are at a lower energy level than the reactants. This means that in an exothermic
reaction the products are more stable than the reactants.
It is the opposite when considering an endothermic reaction, where the ΔH is positive.
In these reactions, the reactants, which are at a lower energy level than the products, are
more stable.
Key points and differences between exothermic and endothermic reactions are summarised
in Table 1C–2.

Combustion of fuels
Earlier in this chapter, we discussed fuels as sources of energy. To obtain energy from these
types of fuels, they must undergo combustion reactions. Combustion reactions involve
reacting an organic fuel in the presence of oxygen gas, and produce carbon dioxide, water
and heat energy. As heat energy is released as part of these reactions, all combustion
reactions are exothermic.
Knowledge of combustion reactions means they can be employed in society’s favour. This
can allow for more efficient consumption of petrol in a car or to maximise the energy
produced in thermal power plants. With the increasing severity of bushfires in Australia,
there has been a growing resurgence of interest in examining the techniques of First
Nations cultural (or cool) burning, the oldest known farming practice in the world. First
Nations rangers and traditional owners in the Kimberley region in northern Western
Australia perform targeted burnings during the early dry season (March to July) to
minimise the most dangerous season for bushfires (August to November).
Combustion reactions can be represented by thermochemical equations, which not only
show the reactants and products of the reaction, but also the energy released.
Let’s start by writing the balanced equation for the complete combustion of methane:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
The first thing that you might notice in the above equation is that water is present in
the gaseous state (that is, as water vapour), rather than as a liquid. This is because all
combustion reactions occur at high temperatures that are above the boiling point of water.
This equation, however, is not a thermochemical equation. For this, we need to add in the
enthalpy change data for the combustion of methane. For many common fuels, the heat of
combustion has been determined experimentally, and the values are provided in the VCAA
Data Book. Using this, we see that the heat of combustion for methane is given as 55.6 kJ g–1
or 890 kJ mol–1. This can then be added to our balanced equation to give us a complete
thermochemical equation as follows:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) ΔH = –890 kJ mol–1

NOTE
You will notice that in the thermochemical equation, the state for the water produced is now
liquid (l). This is because all reactants and products must be in their standard states at SLC
(standard laboratory conditions; 25ºC, 100 kPa).
With this information, it is possible to calculate the quantity of heat released from
the combustion of methane in almost any given situation at 25ºC and 100 kPa. This
thermochemical equation tells us that the combustion of one mole of methane releases
890 kJ of energy. If two moles of methane underwent combustion, 1780 kJ of energy (that is,
2 × 890) would be released. You will learn more about how to perform these calculations
in Section 2A. In these instances, we are assuming that the fuel continues to react until
it is all gone. This is true if the reaction takes place with an abundance of oxygen gas;
however, this isn’t always the case. If the oxygen is depleted before the fuel, the reaction
is known as incomplete combustion. Due to the lack of oxygen present, different carbon-
containing products are formed from this reaction: solid carbon, carbon monoxide gas

and carbon dioxide gas. Shown below is one possible equation for the incomplete
combustion of methane, where carbon monoxide, rather than carbon dioxide, is the only
carbon-containing product generated:
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(l)
If incomplete combustion occurs, the energy released will be less than if complete
combustion occurs. To determine whether complete or incomplete combustion will occur in
certain circumstances, we need to understand the concept of limiting and excess reagents.
NOTE
In some cases of incomplete combustion, solid carbon, C(s), is also produced as a product. This
can be observed as soot.
Limiting and excess reagents
In Unit 2, you learned about a variety of different applications where you may be required

to perform stoichiometric calculations. As part of this, you were introduced to the concept
of mole ratios, which are represented by the coefficients in a chemical equation and provide

information about the relative amounts of each compound needed for the reaction to occur.
In a way, this is similar to how a recipe provides instructions on the different quantities of
ingredients required to make a meal or bake a cake.
Let’s look at part of a hypothetical recipe for a banana cake. As well as other ingredients, the
recipe says that to make one cake we need:
• 3 bananas
• 2 eggs
• 1 cup of milk.
Pantry 1 Pantry 2 Pantry 3
Figure 1C–2 Using cake ingredients to model
mole ratios
We can essentially express this in the same way that we would a
balanced chemical reaction:
3 bananas + 2 eggs + 1 cup of milk → 1 banana cake
This shows us that the numbers (or coefficients) in front of each
ingredient provide the ratio required to make our product, the
banana cake. Now let’s look at the ingredients contained within
three potential pantries (Figure 1C–2).
Referring to our original recipe equation, we need: 3 bananas,
2 eggs and 1 cup of milk.
For each pantry, our equation looks like this:
Pantry 1: 3 bananas + 2 eggs + 1 cup of milk → ? banana cakes
Pantry 2: 3 bananas + 4 eggs + 2 cups of milk → ? banana cakes
Pantry 3: 6 bananas + 3 eggs + 2 cups of milk → ? banana cakes
In each instance, you can see that we need to work out the total
number of banana cakes that we can make from the ingredients
that we have.
In pantry 1, we have the exact number of each ingredient required by the original recipe to
make a single banana cake.

In pantry 2, we can see that we have double the number of eggs and double the number
of cups of milk required to make a single banana cake. However, if we wanted to make
two banana cakes, we would also need 6 bananas. We only have 3 bananas in this pantry,
which is only enough to make 1 banana cake. In this instance, the bananas are our limiting
ingredient (or reagent). In contrast, the eggs and milk will both be present in excess.
In pantry 3, we can see that we have double the number of bananas and double the
number of cups of milk required to make a single banana cake. However, if we wanted to
make 2 banana cakes, we would also need 4 eggs. While we have more eggs than we need
to make a single cake (2 eggs), we still have less than we need to make 2 cakes (4 eggs).
This means that in this pantry, the eggs are our limiting ingredient and the bananas and
milk will both be present in excess.
From this example, it should be clear that we can only make as many cakes as our limiting
ingredient allows. By applying our ingredient ratios to pantry 3 and only focusing on the
limiting ingredient, we can calculate the following:
2 eggs: 1 cake
3 eggs: 1.5 cakes
While this example may have just made you crave banana cake, it also illustrates perfectly
the concept of limiting and excess reagents and how they can be used to calculate the
theoretical amount of product that can be generated from a chemical reaction.
Let’s now look at a specific worked example using the combustion of methane.

EXAMPLE 1C–1
A 2.0 mol sample of methane (CH4) reacts in the presence of 6.0 mol of oxygen (O2) to
produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). Determine the limiting reagent in this
reaction.
Solution
Logic Process
Step 1 Write a balanced equation for the
reaction.
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
Step 2 Write the relevant information provided
in the question under the equation.
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
n(CH4) = 2.0 mol; n(O2) = 6.0 mol
Step 3 Calculate the number of moles of
each reactant using coefficients in the
equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 1 : 2
So, 2 mol of CH4 would react with
4 mol of O2.
Step 4 Based on the moles present of one
reactant, work out how much would
be required of the other, based on the
mole ratio in the equation.
4 mol of O2 required
6 mol of O2 present
O2 present > O2 required
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the second
reagent is more or less than what is
required from Step 3.
There is more oxygen present than
required.
Step 6 State the limiting reagent. Methane is the limiting reagent.

30 CHAPTER 1 CARBON-BASED FUELS
As you can see in Worked example 1C–1, the oxygen is in excess and so this will lead to
complete combustion. You can also see from this example that we need to know the moles
of each reactant to determine the limiting and excess reagents. However, if you are given a
mass, as in the following example, you need to complete an extra step.

WORKED
EXAMPLE 1C–2
Worked example 1C–2: Determining the limiting reagent in moles
Methane (CH4) reacts in the presence of oxygen (O2) to produce carbon monoxide (CO)
and water (H2O). Initially, 8.0 g of methane and 16.0 g of oxygen are present. Determine
the limiting reagent in this reaction.
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write a balanced equation for
the reaction.
Process
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
Step 2 Write the relevant information
provided in the question under
the equation.
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
m = 8.0 g m = 16.0 g
Step 3 Calculate the amount, in mol,
of each reactant.
n(CH4) = m
M
n(CH4) = 8.0 g
16.0 g mol–1
n(CH4) = 0.50 mol
n(O2) = m
M
n(O2) = 16.0 g
32.0 g mol–1
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
Step 4 Based on the moles present
of one reactant, work out how
much would be required of the
other, based on the mole ratio
in the equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 2 : 3
0.50 mol of O2 would react with 0.33 mol
of CH4.
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the
second reagent is more or less
than what is required from
Step 3.
0.33 mol of CH4 required
0.50 mol of CH4 present
CH4 present > CH4 required
Step 6 State the limiting reagent. As there is more CH4 present than required,
CH4 is the excess reagent, making O2 the
limiting reagent.
Lastly, once we have determined the limiting reagent, we can also use this information
to calculate the amount or mass of a product, or the quantity of heat in the case of
combustion, that is generated from the reaction. This type of question is illustrated in
Worked example 1C–3.

of heat
VIDEO
WORKED
EXAMPLE 1C–3
Using the reaction from Worked example 1C–2, determine the mass of carbon
monoxide that would be produced. We will start from the beginning and add extra steps
at the end to show how this question could be done in its entirety.
Solution
Logic Write a balanced equation for
the reaction.
Process
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
Step 1 Step 2 Write the relevant information
provided in the question under
the equation.
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
m = 8.0 g m = 16.0 g
Step 3 Calculate the amount, in mol,
of each reactant.
n(CH4) = m
M
n(CH4) = 8.0 g
16.0 g mol–1
n(CH4) = 0.50 mol
n(O2) = m
M
n(O2) = 16.0 g
32.0 g mol–1
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
Step 4 Based on the moles present
of one reactant, work out how
much would be required of the
other, based on the mole ratio
in the equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 2 : 3
0.50 mol of O2 would react with 0.33 mol
of CH4.
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the
second reagent is more or less
than what is required from
Step 3.
0.33 mol of CH4 required
0.50 mol of CH4 present
CH4 present > CH4 required
Step 6 State the limiting reagent. Step 7 Use the number of moles of the
limiting reagent and the mole
ratio to calculate the number of
moles of the desired product.
As there is more CH4 present than required,
CH4 is the excess reagent, making O2 the
limiting reagent.
n(O2) : n(CO) = 3 : 2
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
n(C0 produced) = 2
× 0.50 = 0.33 mol
3
Step 8 Use n =
m
to calculate the
M
mass in grams produced.
n(CO) = m
M
m(CO) = n × M
m(CO) = 0.33 mol × 28.0 g mol–1
m(CO produced) = 9.3 g
Linking this back to combustion reactions, we can now understand the main difference
between complete and incomplete combustion and summarise it as follows:
• complete combustion: the fuel is the limiting reagent, oxygen is the excess reagent
• incomplete combustion: the fuel is the excess reagent, oxygen is the limiting reagent.

Representing and analysing energy profile diagrams
Being able to draw fully labelled energy profile diagrams is an important skill for
assessments. However, you also need to be able to explain what each part of the energy
profile diagram represents, as well as connect this to key chemistry terms for this topic.
Consider the example shown below.
Energy from the environment
required to break bonds in
the reactant(s)
Energy released to the
environment in the forming
of bonds in the product(s)
Activation energy (Ea)
*The double-headed arrow must extend
from the base energy of the reactants to the
peak of the graph. Therefore, it is good to
include a dotted line using a ruler.*
Energy
Reactants
Products
Enthalpy change, ( H ), representing
the difference in energy between the
reactants and the products
Progress of reaction
Initial energy stored
in the reactants
Final energy stored
in the products
An energy profile diagram like the one above could be given to you in a question. The
following are some example tasks that you may be asked to complete:
• Label the activation energy (answer shown in purple above).
• Label OR explain the enthalpy change (answer shown in orange above).
• Describe why the amount of energy increases initially in the energy profile diagram
(answer shown in green above).
• Describe why the amount of energy decreases following the top of the peak in the energy
profile diagram (answer shown in blue above).
Note, when labelling the activation energy or enthalpy change you need to be precise
with placement of arrows otherwise you will lose marks. Using a ruler to draw a dotted
horizontal line makes this labelling easier.
Another question may be: Does the energy profile diagram represent an exothermic or
an endothermic reaction? Justify your reasoning.
For this question, you should note that as this is a 50:50 choice, you do not get a mark
for making the correct selection. The term ‘justify’ means you need to provide evidence/
reasons why the energy profile diagram is exothermic or why it is not endothermic. As
such, if this was a 2-mark question, your answer should look as follows:
Exothermic (no mark)
The energy of the products is lower than the energy of the reactants (1 mark) OR the
enthalpy change (ΔH) is negative. (1 mark)
Whereas, for endothermic reactions the energy of the products is higher than the energy of
the reactants OR the enthalpy change (ΔH) is positive. (1 mark)

be poisonous if inhaled in large enough quantities. This is one reason why camp
stoves have warnings not to be used inside a tent, as the carbon monoxide

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can write and interpret the balanced equation for photosynthesis
CODE: 1B.2

WHAT (concept explanation):
The photosynthesis equation is 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(l) → C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(g), requiring light energy and chlorophyll. It shows the mole ratio of 6:6:1:6 for reactants and products.

WHY (importance):
This equation allows calculation of reactant requirements and product yields, and demonstrates the stoichiometric relationships in biological energy transformation.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
To produce 180 g of glucose (1 mol), plants require 264 g of carbon dioxide (6 mol) and 108 g of water (6 mol), releasing 192 g of oxygen (6 mol).

SUBTOPIC: Chemical Energy in Nature
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic examines how plants and animals produce and transform energy through photosynthesis and cellular respiration. It covers the chemical equations, conditions, and relationship between these complementary biological processes.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: These processes form the foundation of energy flow in ecosystems and are the basis for all biofuels. Understanding them connects light energy to usable chemical energy and explains how organisms meet their energy needs.

TOPIC: Carbon-Based Fuels
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Exploration of fossil fuels and biofuels, their production, renewability, and energy transformations. Includes photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and thermochemical analysis of combustion reactions.

CARBON-BASED FUELS
Introduction
This chapter begins your exploration of energy and some of the different types of
fuel used to generate energy for society. You will compare various types of fossil
fuels and biofuels, including how they are sourced, produced and used in society,
while understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each. You will also look
at the processes by which plants and animals convert the energy contained within
light and food into usable forms of chemical energy. You will learn about reactions that
either release or absorb heat energy, as well as how to represent these diagrammatically.
Finally, you will look at calculating the quantity of energy released from the combustion
of fuels and explore the concepts of limiting and excess reagents for these types of reactions.

ENGAGE
Australia’s first petrol-driven car
When Harley Tarrant was young, his
father owned the Clunes Gazette, the
St Kilda Chronicle and the Prahran
Chronicle. As such, Harley was
surrounded by information from overseas
publications, and from these articles he
learned about, and became obsessed
with, cars.
Later, when working on the Nullarbor
Plain as a surveyor, he determined
that steam and electric vehicles would
not be suitable to tackle the harsh
Australian outback. In 1897, he decided
to build a kerosene engine with bicycle-
maker, Howard Lewis. Due to the high

the first two-seater, two-cylinder petrol engine
automobile built and sold in Australia, by
Harley Tarrant and Howard Lewis in 1901.
temperature at which kerosene vaporises,
it was not suitable as a fuel for a car engine, but it was ideal for pumping water. His engine
sold extremely well across Australia, providing him funding to continue working on a
suitable fuel and engine for an automobile.
Following this, Tarrant and Lewis set out to build their own petrol-driven car, which
used an imported Benz engine. After successfully developing a two-cylinder petrol
motor car in 1901, they refined it further with their own locally made engine. At the
time, they decided to sacrifice speed for a car that would thrive in Australian conditions.
Since then, and especially recently, the use of different fuels has continued to evolve
from fossil fuels to biofuels, and now the push to fully electric vehicles. Fossil fuels and
biofuels, with a focus on their renewability, are discussed further in this section.

EXPLAIN
What are fuels and why do we need them?
Likely, when you hear the word ‘fuel’, you think about petrol, diesel or coal used to power
planes, trains and automobiles. However, as you will see later in this chapter, food, such as
sugar, is also used as a fuel for our bodies.
Fuels are both organic and inorganic substances capable of storing chemical energy. In this
section, we will look at only organic fuels. As you will see in Section 1C, when a fuel is
burned, the stored chemical energy is released as heat (thermal) energy, which can then be
further used to power objects.
You should be familiar with the units of energy from earlier years in science. The
International System of Units (SI) unit for energy is the joule, J.
Fossil fuels
Fossil fuels are mostly hydrocarbons, with some other minor impurities, as you learned
about in Unit 1 and will learn more about in Unit 4. They are called ‘fossil’ fuels, as they
are formed through the fossilised remains and subsequent decay of plants, animals and
microorganisms, which lived millions of years ago. The hydrocarbon remains are extracted
through mining and the drilling of wells both on land and at sea. These remains still contain
some of the chemical energy that the plants, and the plants consumed by animals at the
time, originally stored from transforming light energy from the Sun when carrying out
photosynthesis. Photosynthesis as a chemical process will be covered further in Section 1B.
Fossil fuels are non-renewable, meaning their availability is limited and they are being
consumed at a rate faster than they are being produced. As these fossil fuels are formed over
millions of years, once they are depleted, they will not be replaced any time soon.
Fossil fuels can be separated into three main categories: coal, natural gas and petroleum.

Coal
Coal is a layer of sedimentary rock formed underground, containing mostly plant remains,
that are then buried by further sediments. It is formed under low oxygen conditions at
high temperatures and pressures over millions of years. Coal formations are called ‘coal
beds’ and they exist globally. The deeper the coal bed, the higher its rank, where the
ranking is based on how much it has changed over time. Deeper underground, the plant
matter experiences higher temperatures and pressures, and so more of the plant remains
are transformed into carbon, while water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane
(CH4) escape. The methane that is produced is trapped as coal seam gas. The higher the
percentage of carbon, the better the coal fuel source.

Coal is the most abundant of the fossil fuels and is the largest fuel source used for
generating electricity in the world. Coal is Australia’s largest energy resource. It is mined in
every state in Australia, with the largest black coal resources located in New South Wales
and Queensland. As Figure 1A–3 shows, black coal is buried deeper than other layers of
coal, but because of the heat efficiency it provides, it is much more economical for mining.
Approximately 70% of the coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to eastern Asian
regions. In 2019, pre-COVID, coal exploration expenditure was $229 million, which was
an increase of 32% from 2018. In comparison, the combustion of brown coal produces
approximately 85% of Australia’s electricity.

Fracking
a process in

Natural gas
Natural gas is mostly methane (CH4), with traces of other small hydrocarbons, such as
ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10). Other substances including water,
carbon dioxide, sulfur and nitrogen can also be present in the gas reservoirs.
You will recall that in the formation of coal, the increased pressure and temperature
resulted in the physical and chemical change of the sedimentary rock, releasing methane,
carbon dioxide and water.
Likewise, this pressure causes the natural gas found in rock formations to adsorb to the
surface of the coal. When drilling wells fracture coal deposits, natural gas flows to the
surface, as shown in Figure 1A–4. This process is called fracking. A fracking fluid is injected
into the well to increase the permeability of the sediment, allowing an easier flow of gas to
the surface. The fracking fluid contains sand, water and other chemicals. A chemical once
used in fracking fluid was benzene, which you will learn about in Section 8B. However, this
has been banned in Australia because it is carcinogenic, and there is a potential risk of it
escaping and contaminating water supplies. Sand is convenient as a component of this fluid
because it is often present at the site of drilling. However, water is not, and so this has to
be transported to the drilling sites, which is environmentally unfriendly and economically
costly.
One of the environmental concerns associated with fracking is that it releases methane, a
greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. It is predicted that approximately 4–8% leaks to the
atmosphere from the well head, pipelines and storage facilities.

Petroleum
In Unit 1, you learned about crude oil as being a mixture of predominantly alkanes, which
are organic hydrocarbon molecules. Like coal and natural gas, crude oil is formed from
plant and animal remains that decay over millions of years. However, crude oil is not as
widespread or as easy to access as coal and natural gas.
Crude oil is essentially petrol (petroleum). However, because the crude oil mixture contains
many hydrocarbons with varying sizes (based on their number of carbon atoms), it is not
useful to mine and use directly once drilled and brought to the surface. The crude oil
first needs to be separated into its various hydrocarbon fractions in a process called
fractional distillation.
Fractional distillation works on the fundamental basis that different-sized hydrocarbons
can be separated from each other because of their different boiling points, something you
learned in Unit 1 and will again cover in Section 10B. Countries in the Middle East are the
main sources and exporters of crude oil, including petrol, internationally. Australia, being
one of their trade partners, imports 90% of all the crude oil it uses. Australia does have a few
small crude oil reserves off the coast of northern Western Australia, South Australia and
Bass Strait; however, these are likely to be depleted by 2100.

Biofuels
While fossil fuels take millions of years to produce, and are being used up at a faster rate
than which they are being replenished, biofuels are the opposite. Biofuels are classified
as renewable because they can be produced at the same rate at which they are consumed.
As the name suggests, they are produced from living (hence, bio) matter, called biomass.
There are three types of biofuels covered in this chapter: biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel.
Figure 1A–5 shows the proportion of feedstocks in total biofuel production. As you will see
in the following pages, different feedstocks can be used for different types of biofuel.

Biogas
Biogas is formed from the breakdown of organic biological waste, such as plant matter,
by anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria are those that thrive in the absence of oxygen.
The bacteria break down complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose and starch, as well as
proteins, into simpler molecules. The contents and percentage of these simpler molecules
will depend on the starting organic material that is being decomposed. Approximate
percentages are shown in Table 1A–1.

As you can see from the biogas cycle shown in Figure 1A–6, the original solar energy is
captured by crops and transformed into chemical energy by photosynthesis, which will
be explored in Section 1B. For large-scale production, the organic waste produced from
harvesting crops, food waste and animal by-products is placed in a large tank called a
digester. The digester is filled with anaerobic bacteria. Waste from this process can be used
as a good biofertiliser and the biogas produced is useful for heating and electricity in homes
and farms. This cycle further highlights the renewability and low impact of greenhouse
gas emissions for this process.

The Australian biogas industry is still emerging. In 2017, there were 272 biogas plants,
most of which use raw materials that would otherwise rot in landfill. In 2021, the first
large-scale biogas plant was announced for Nowra, in NSW. According to the Australian
Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), the estimated biogas potential would place Australia
on par with Germany, a leading country in the production of biogas.

Ethanol can be manufactured by the addition reaction of ethene with steam. You will
encounter this reaction again in Section 9A.
More commonly and naturally, ethanol is produced in plants and yeast that undergo
anaerobic fermentation. Typical crops grown globally for ethanol production include corn,
maize and wheat, but Australia has a long history of fermenting native plants. The Palawa
people of Tasmania have a history of using the sap of a cider gum to make the sweet
fermented drink wayalinah, and the Noongar people in south-western Australia have
fermented the fruit of the macrozamia plant (known as by-yu or kwineen) as a method of
detoxification and to enhance its nutritional value.

The main feedstock used in Australia for producing bioethanol is wheat. Facilities are
currently located in both New South Wales and Queensland, with plans for a large-scale
facility to operate in regional Victoria in the future.
In wheat and other first-generation feedstocks, biological catalysts called enzymes speed
up the breakdown of cellulose and starch to sucrose. Yeast is then added to this solution.
The yeast contains another enzyme called invertase, which helps convert the sucrose into
glucose. The glucose then binds with another enzyme in the yeast called zymase, which
assists the final step of fermentation into ethanol (bioethanol) and carbon dioxide according
to the following equation.
glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide
C6H12O6(aq) → 2CH3CH2OH(aq) + 2CO2(g)
Notice that the ethanol produced from fermentation is in an aqueous (aq) state. This
means that it is not pure and is hydrated by water molecules. These water molecules are
removed by distillation, which will be covered in more detail in Section 10B.

If you’ve got your learner permit or probationary licence and have driven to fill the car up
at the petrol station, you will have noticed the fuel pump labelled ‘E10’. It is called E10 as
it contains a blend of 90% petrol and 10% ethanol. The addition of ethanol to petrol has
several advantages, including:
• the use of petrol derived from crude oil is reduced
• the fuel is oxygenated so that it burns more completely
• the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is reduced
• the source of the bioethanol makes it a more sustainable transport fuel.
Biodiesel
Biodiesel is a mixture of organic compounds produced from vegetable oils, cooking oils
and animal fats. Because it is produced from plant and/or animal products, it is renewable
and often called ‘green diesel’. A transesterification reaction between plant and/or animal
triglycerides (fats, oils) and alcohol, typically methanol (CH3OH), results in a mixture
of methyl esters, or biodiesel. You will learn more about transesterification reactions in
Section 9B; however, an example reaction is shown in Figure 1A–8 below. Note that this
reaction also requires the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
acting as a catalyst. Biodiesel production in this way requires less energy and has less
emissions than producing bioethanol.

The other product in the transesterification reaction, glycerol, is commonly used in the
manufacture of pharmaceuticals. You will learn more about medicinal chemistry in Chapter 12.
If you look back at Figure 1A–5 on page 10, you will see that a large number of the
feedstocks used in biofuel production are vegetable oils, used for biodiesels.
There are currently three biodiesel plants operating in Australia. However, after peaking in
the mid-2010s, they now operate at less than 40% capacity. With only around 0.2% blend
rate with standard diesel, it is a fuel with very little focus in Australia. Globally, biodiesel
can be used in most existing diesel engines without them needing further modifications.
Like bioethanol, these blends are also labelled at the pump, typically as B5 or B20,
indicating a 5% or 20% blend, respectively, of biodiesel with standard diesel.

Comparing fossil fuels and biofuels
In this chapter so far, you have learned about six different types of fuels. Three of these
were fossil fuels and three were biofuels. Table 1A–3 highlights the key comparisons of
these with a focus on their renewability and societal impacts.
Table 1A–3 Advantages and disadvantages of the different types of fossil fuels and biofuels
Advantages Fuel type Disadvantages
Fossil fuels
(non-renewable)
Coal • Mined easily
• Large reserves remaining
• Cheap
• Can be converted to liquid and
gas fuel, which is more portable
if oil runs out
• Traces of sulfur and nitrogen react with
atmospheric O2 to form SO2 and NO2,
which contribute to acid rain.
• Finite supply so will eventually run out
Natural gas • Moderate cost for consumers
• Easily converted to methanol
• Produces least pollution
• Limited reserves remaining
• Economically expensive to harness
and transport
• Environmental concerns over fracking
Petrol • Easily transported
• Less pollution than coal
• Many applications
• Limited reserves remaining globally,
and availability will decline within
decades
• Expensive
• Mining is destroying ecosystems
(both on and offshore)
Biofuels
(renewable)
Biogas • Derived from plants, animals
and humans
• Utilisation of waste for heating,
electricity and fertilisers, rather
than letting it rot in landfills
• Produces a circular economy
• Good alternative for electricity
and heating in rural areas or
developing countries
• Very few technological advancements,
so additional research and government
funding required to make production
efficient
• Anaerobic digestion occurs optimally
at 37°C, so in colder climates heat
energy is required to generate biogas
continually.
• Odour is emitted from digesters used in
this process, so a need to build these
in locations away from residences
Bioethanol • Reduces greenhouse gas
emissions, as crops used for
fuel production absorb the CO2
they emit when burned
• Combining with oil extends the
longevity of limited crude oil
supplies
• Production requires large volumes of
water.
• The food vs fuel debate of growing
crops
Biodiesel • New land not required for
production
• Reduces hydrocarbon
emissions and the lifecycle of
greenhouse gases
• Reduces smog thereby
reducing atmospheric pollution
• Farmland used for growing fuel instead
of food
• Large volumes of water (or availability)
and fertilisers required

1A TYPES OF FUELS

While biofuels might seem like a better alternative to fossil fuels, their increasing use in
the immediate future raises a number of other important implications that need to be
considered and managed, including:
• how much land degradation and forest destruction occurs to grow crops
• the percentage of crops grown for fuel versus that grown for food to meet the needs of
increasing population sizes.
Research is underway to look at the potential for either algae or agave crops to be used as a
feedstock for biodiesel production. The latter thrives in dry, arid desert environments with
little water and produces a high oil yield. Therefore, land required for growing food would
not be compromised.

QUESTIONS
Comparison-based questions
In this section, you were presented with six different types of fuels. You learned
about how and where each was sourced from, the chemical processes used in their
production and their respective advantages and disadvantages. As such, it is predictable
that assessment questions will require you to compare various aspects of different
combinations of these fuels. In comparison or contrast questions, you are required to
explain both the similarities and differences of each item in the question. Let’s look at an
example question, which has been adapted from the 2021 VCAA Exam and solution.
Question
Digesters use bacteria to convert organic waste into biogas. Both biogas and coal seam
gas have the same hydrocarbon as their main component. Referring specifically to this
hydrocarbon, compare biogas and coal seam gas.
VCAA 2021
Answer
Similarities:
Both are types of fuels that contain mainly methane, CH4.
Differences:
• Coal seam gas is non-renewable as it originally comes from the increased
temperature and pressure experienced by sedimentary rock deeper below Earth’s
surface and is not produced at a rate equal to or faster than it is consumed.
• On the other hand, biogas is renewable, as it is produced from the breakdown of plant
matter, in particular cellulose and starch, by bacteria under anaerobic conditions.
Notice that in this answer, the comparison word ‘whereas’ was used to differentiate
between the difference of the two fuels.
This was just one example for two fuels covered in this chapter, but other examples
may require you to compare two different types of fossil fuels or two different types of
biofuels, the advantages and/or disadvantages of different fuels or their renewability.
Developing a clear set of notes with what makes each distinct from the other will be
important for this section.

The carbon economy
Have you heard of the carbon economy? Perhaps you’re more familiar with the term
‘carbon footprint’. Both of these relate to carbon dioxide emissions. As you learned in
Unit 2, carbon dioxide emissions (a type of greenhouse gas) are primarily responsible
for global warming and climate change. Carbon dioxide is released naturally through
processes like cellular respiration, which you will learn more about in this chapter,
and fermentation. However, other human activities, such as deforestation and the
burning of fossil fuels, which you will learn more about in Section 1C, have been the
main producers of the gas. For decades, efforts have been made to monitor and lower
these emissions. Governments and industries are continually improving the efficiency
of photosynthesis, which is the way carbon dioxide is naturally removed from the
atmosphere. The benefits of this improvement will be twofold. The world’s population
is growing rapidly and greater quantities of food will be needed to support future
generations. Not only will there be less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but it is
thought that increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis will mean more nutrient-rich
crops and increased crop yields. Governments and industries also want to increase
the production of biomass, a sustainable and renewable energy resource, in the hope
that this will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and again reduce the volume of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.

Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is an anabolic chemical reaction in which the Sun’s light energy is used to
convert the inorganic compounds carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into the organic
compound glucose (C6H12O6). Glucose can then be used as a source of energy by the cells
of living organisms, enabling growth and reproduction.
Photosynthesis consists of a series of steps (a biochemical pathway), with each step
controlled by a different enzyme. The overall process of photosynthesis can be written as
both a word equation and a balanced chemical equation:

The oxygen released is

is a very important reactant
for cellular respiration in both
plants and animals. The glucose
produced from photosynthesis
in plants is the key reactant
required for cellular respiration
in living organisms, as you
will see later in this chapter.
As you learned in Section 1A,
glucose is also the key input for
fermentation in the production
of bioethanol from plants
and yeast.
Photosynthesis is an example
of an endothermic reaction,
which you will learn about in

2 a Write the word equation for photosynthesis.
b Write the simplified balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis.
Cellular respiration
Like photosynthesis, cellular respiration occurs as a series of steps in a biochemical
pathway, with each step controlled by a different enzyme. You do not need to be familiar
with any of these steps in this chemistry course. The purpose of cellular respiration is the
catabolic breakdown of glucose, which releases the chemical energy in a form more usable
for cells, as a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
There are two types of cellular respiration. The first occurs in the absence of oxygen
(anaerobic) and is commonly referred to as fermentation. You learned about this in
Section 1A. This occurs in certain plants and yeast, resulting in the production of ethanol
(bioethanol) and carbon dioxide, according to the following equation:
glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide
C6H12O6(aq) → 2CH3CH2OH(aq) + 2CO2(g)
In animals, a slightly different form of anaerobic cellular respiration takes place. It is often
called lactic acid fermentation and results in the production of lactic acid (lactate ions),
which is associated with muscle cramping. This chemical reaction is represented according
to the following equation:

The second form of cellular respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen (aerobic). This
occurs in many plant and animal cells with some steps occurring inside the mitochondria,
the energy powerhouse of the cell. Aerobic cellular respiration results in a much greater
yield of energy per mole of glucose than that yielded by anaerobic cellular respiration.

You will recall from Unit 2, and this will again be covered in Section 3A, that oxidation
means a loss of electrons. If you look at the oxidation numbers, in red, shown above the
balanced chemical equation, you will see that the carbon changes from a ‘0’ to a ‘+4’
oxidation number. This means it is losing electrons. Conversely, the oxygen gas reactant is
being reduced, as it changes oxidation number from ‘0’ to ‘+2’.
As glucose can be broken down to release the energy required for all metabolic reactions
occurring in our bodies’ cells, it is a type of fuel. Like the other fuels you learned about in
Section 1A, it undergoes a combustion reaction that releases energy, which means it is an
exothermic reaction. Exothermic combustion reactions will be discussed in more detail in
Section 1C.
As in photosynthesis, there are many factors which affect the rate of cellular respiration
reactions, such as temperature, glucose availability, oxygen concentration and enzyme
(catalyst) concentration. Factors affecting the frequency and success of collisions between
reactants, and the subsequent rate of chemical reactions, are explored further in Section 5B.

Figure 1B–4 The complementary nature of the photosynthesis and cellular respiration reactions
means that carbon, hydrogen and oxygen cycle through organisms and their environments continually.
Referring to Figure 1B–4, note the following key points.
• Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, an organelle found only in the cells of green
plants and algae.
• The products of photosynthesis (oxygen and glucose) are used as reactants in the
process of aerobic cellular respiration.
• Aerobic cellular respiration occurs mostly in mitochondria, organelles found in
animal, plant and fungal cells, and protists.
• Aerobic cellular respiration uses the products of photosynthesis to produce ATP,
an energy storage molecule, which can then release energy to meet the cell’s
requirements.
• In plants, the products of aerobic cellular respiration (water and carbon dioxide) can
then be used as reactants in the process of photosynthesis.
• Although photosynthesis appears to be the reverse of cellular respiration, the
processes are different and use different enzymes. (You will learn in general about
enzymes in Section 12B.)
Using the Study Design to guide your preparation
The most important way of determining the detail you need to know is by looking at
the Study Design and completing many practice questions. Keep focused on the terms
used in the Study Design dot points and, when making notes, always use the dot points,
or part of the dot points, as your headings. The Study Design was written specifically to
cover what you need to know, and the success criteria have been written to guide you
through the necessary material.
For example, the Study Design requires you to know that photosynthesis is a source of
both glucose and oxygen, which are required for respiration in living things, and that it is
in these living things where the glucose is oxidised as the primary energy source.

ENGAGE
It’s getting hot!
What do composting vegetable waste and burning a candle have in common? While
it may seem like the answer should be ‘not much at all’, they are in fact linked as they
both involve chemical reactions that release heat into the environment! In this section,
you are going to gain an understanding of two different types of reactions and how they
either release or absorb heat from the environment. You will also investigate a specific
type of exothermic reaction, called combustion reactions, as a way of obtaining energy
from fuels. Lastly, you will learn how to draw energy profile diagrams to represent the
reactions occurring during these processes.

EXPLAIN
Exothermic and endothermic reactions
For a chemical reaction to occur, the bonds within the reactants must first be broken.
This requires energy and the exact quantity of energy is specific for each reaction. Every
reaction has a minimum amount of energy that is needed for the reaction to occur –
this is known as the activation energy and is represented by the symbol E
. As a reaction
a
proceeds, new bonds must be formed to generate the products. Unlike breaking bonds,
this process releases energy. This can be summarised by the following statements:
Breaking bonds: requires energy from the environment
Forming bonds: releases energy to the environment
The chemical energy of a substance is called its enthalpy or heat content and has the
symbol H. The overall change in energy from reactants to products is known as the
enthalpy change (ΔH). The enthalpy change indicates whether more energy was required
to break the reactant bonds than was released forming the product bonds or vice versa. It
can be represented by the equation:
Δ H(reaction) = Σ H(reactant bonds broken) – Σ H(product bonds formed)
From this equation, we can see that there are two possible outcomes.
1 The energy required to break the bonds of the reactants is greater than the energy
released from forming the bonds in the products. In this instance, the ΔH will be
positive, and the reaction is referred to as an endothermic reaction.
2 The energy required to break the bonds of the reactants is less than the energy released
from forming the bonds in the products. In this instance, the ΔH will be negative, and
the reaction is referred to as an exothermic reaction.
Exothermic and endothermic reactions can be illustrated using energy profile diagrams
(Figure 1C–1).

Calculating the value for the enthalpy change of a reaction can be important in
understanding the energy content of fuels and foods. This will be covered in more depth
in Section 2B.
It is important to note that in an exothermic reaction, where the ΔH is negative, the
products are at a lower energy level than the reactants. This means that in an exothermic
reaction the products are more stable than the reactants.
It is the opposite when considering an endothermic reaction, where the ΔH is positive.
In these reactions, the reactants, which are at a lower energy level than the products, are
more stable.
Key points and differences between exothermic and endothermic reactions are summarised
in Table 1C–2.

Combustion of fuels
Earlier in this chapter, we discussed fuels as sources of energy. To obtain energy from these
types of fuels, they must undergo combustion reactions. Combustion reactions involve
reacting an organic fuel in the presence of oxygen gas, and produce carbon dioxide, water
and heat energy. As heat energy is released as part of these reactions, all combustion
reactions are exothermic.
Knowledge of combustion reactions means they can be employed in society’s favour. This
can allow for more efficient consumption of petrol in a car or to maximise the energy
produced in thermal power plants. With the increasing severity of bushfires in Australia,
there has been a growing resurgence of interest in examining the techniques of First
Nations cultural (or cool) burning, the oldest known farming practice in the world. First
Nations rangers and traditional owners in the Kimberley region in northern Western
Australia perform targeted burnings during the early dry season (March to July) to
minimise the most dangerous season for bushfires (August to November).
Combustion reactions can be represented by thermochemical equations, which not only
show the reactants and products of the reaction, but also the energy released.
Let’s start by writing the balanced equation for the complete combustion of methane:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
The first thing that you might notice in the above equation is that water is present in
the gaseous state (that is, as water vapour), rather than as a liquid. This is because all
combustion reactions occur at high temperatures that are above the boiling point of water.
This equation, however, is not a thermochemical equation. For this, we need to add in the
enthalpy change data for the combustion of methane. For many common fuels, the heat of
combustion has been determined experimentally, and the values are provided in the VCAA
Data Book. Using this, we see that the heat of combustion for methane is given as 55.6 kJ g–1
or 890 kJ mol–1. This can then be added to our balanced equation to give us a complete
thermochemical equation as follows:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) ΔH = –890 kJ mol–1

NOTE
You will notice that in the thermochemical equation, the state for the water produced is now
liquid (l). This is because all reactants and products must be in their standard states at SLC
(standard laboratory conditions; 25ºC, 100 kPa).
With this information, it is possible to calculate the quantity of heat released from
the combustion of methane in almost any given situation at 25ºC and 100 kPa. This
thermochemical equation tells us that the combustion of one mole of methane releases
890 kJ of energy. If two moles of methane underwent combustion, 1780 kJ of energy (that is,
2 × 890) would be released. You will learn more about how to perform these calculations
in Section 2A. In these instances, we are assuming that the fuel continues to react until
it is all gone. This is true if the reaction takes place with an abundance of oxygen gas;
however, this isn’t always the case. If the oxygen is depleted before the fuel, the reaction
is known as incomplete combustion. Due to the lack of oxygen present, different carbon-
containing products are formed from this reaction: solid carbon, carbon monoxide gas

and carbon dioxide gas. Shown below is one possible equation for the incomplete
combustion of methane, where carbon monoxide, rather than carbon dioxide, is the only
carbon-containing product generated:
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(l)
If incomplete combustion occurs, the energy released will be less than if complete
combustion occurs. To determine whether complete or incomplete combustion will occur in
certain circumstances, we need to understand the concept of limiting and excess reagents.
NOTE
In some cases of incomplete combustion, solid carbon, C(s), is also produced as a product. This
can be observed as soot.
Limiting and excess reagents
In Unit 2, you learned about a variety of different applications where you may be required

to perform stoichiometric calculations. As part of this, you were introduced to the concept
of mole ratios, which are represented by the coefficients in a chemical equation and provide

LIMITING
AND EXCESS
REAGENTS
information about the relative amounts of each compound needed for the reaction to occur.
In a way, this is similar to how a recipe provides instructions on the different quantities of
ingredients required to make a meal or bake a cake.
Let’s look at part of a hypothetical recipe for a banana cake. As well as other ingredients, the
recipe says that to make one cake we need:
• 3 bananas
• 2 eggs
• 1 cup of milk.
Pantry 1 Pantry 2 Pantry 3
Figure 1C–2 Using cake ingredients to model
mole ratios
We can essentially express this in the same way that we would a
balanced chemical reaction:
3 bananas + 2 eggs + 1 cup of milk → 1 banana cake
This shows us that the numbers (or coefficients) in front of each
ingredient provide the ratio required to make our product, the
banana cake. Now let’s look at the ingredients contained within
three potential pantries (Figure 1C–2).
Referring to our original recipe equation, we need: 3 bananas,
2 eggs and 1 cup of milk.
For each pantry, our equation looks like this:
Pantry 1: 3 bananas + 2 eggs + 1 cup of milk → ? banana cakes
Pantry 2: 3 bananas + 4 eggs + 2 cups of milk → ? banana cakes
Pantry 3: 6 bananas + 3 eggs + 2 cups of milk → ? banana cakes
In each instance, you can see that we need to work out the total
number of banana cakes that we can make from the ingredients
that we have.
In pantry 1, we have the exact number of each ingredient required by the original recipe to
make a single banana cake.

In pantry 2, we can see that we have double the number of eggs and double the number
of cups of milk required to make a single banana cake. However, if we wanted to make
two banana cakes, we would also need 6 bananas. We only have 3 bananas in this pantry,
which is only enough to make 1 banana cake. In this instance, the bananas are our limiting
ingredient (or reagent). In contrast, the eggs and milk will both be present in excess.
In pantry 3, we can see that we have double the number of bananas and double the
number of cups of milk required to make a single banana cake. However, if we wanted to
make 2 banana cakes, we would also need 4 eggs. While we have more eggs than we need
to make a single cake (2 eggs), we still have less than we need to make 2 cakes (4 eggs).
This means that in this pantry, the eggs are our limiting ingredient and the bananas and
milk will both be present in excess.
From this example, it should be clear that we can only make as many cakes as our limiting
ingredient allows. By applying our ingredient ratios to pantry 3 and only focusing on the
limiting ingredient, we can calculate the following:
2 eggs: 1 cake
3 eggs: 1.5 cakes
While this example may have just made you crave banana cake, it also illustrates perfectly
the concept of limiting and excess reagents and how they can be used to calculate the
theoretical amount of product that can be generated from a chemical reaction.
Let’s now look at a specific worked example using the combustion of methane.

EXAMPLE 1C–1
A 2.0 mol sample of methane (CH4) reacts in the presence of 6.0 mol of oxygen (O2) to
produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). Determine the limiting reagent in this
reaction.
Solution
Logic Process
Step 1 Write a balanced equation for the
reaction.
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
Step 2 Write the relevant information provided
in the question under the equation.
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
n(CH4) = 2.0 mol; n(O2) = 6.0 mol
Step 3 Calculate the number of moles of
each reactant using coefficients in the
equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 1 : 2
So, 2 mol of CH4 would react with
4 mol of O2.
Step 4 Based on the moles present of one
reactant, work out how much would
be required of the other, based on the
mole ratio in the equation.
4 mol of O2 required
6 mol of O2 present
O2 present > O2 required
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the second
reagent is more or less than what is
required from Step 3.
There is more oxygen present than
required.
Step 6 State the limiting reagent. Methane is the limiting reagent.

30 CHAPTER 1 CARBON-BASED FUELS
As you can see in Worked example 1C–1, the oxygen is in excess and so this will lead to
complete combustion. You can also see from this example that we need to know the moles
of each reactant to determine the limiting and excess reagents. However, if you are given a
mass, as in the following example, you need to complete an extra step.

WORKED
EXAMPLE 1C–2
Worked example 1C–2: Determining the limiting reagent in moles
Methane (CH4) reacts in the presence of oxygen (O2) to produce carbon monoxide (CO)
and water (H2O). Initially, 8.0 g of methane and 16.0 g of oxygen are present. Determine
the limiting reagent in this reaction.
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write a balanced equation for
the reaction.
Process
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
Step 2 Write the relevant information
provided in the question under
the equation.
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
m = 8.0 g m = 16.0 g
Step 3 Calculate the amount, in mol,
of each reactant.
n(CH4) = m
M
n(CH4) = 8.0 g
16.0 g mol–1
n(CH4) = 0.50 mol
n(O2) = m
M
n(O2) = 16.0 g
32.0 g mol–1
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
Step 4 Based on the moles present
of one reactant, work out how
much would be required of the
other, based on the mole ratio
in the equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 2 : 3
0.50 mol of O2 would react with 0.33 mol
of CH4.
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the
second reagent is more or less
than what is required from
Step 3.
0.33 mol of CH4 required
0.50 mol of CH4 present
CH4 present > CH4 required
Step 6 State the limiting reagent. As there is more CH4 present than required,
CH4 is the excess reagent, making O2 the
limiting reagent.
Lastly, once we have determined the limiting reagent, we can also use this information
to calculate the amount or mass of a product, or the quantity of heat in the case of
combustion, that is generated from the reaction. This type of question is illustrated in
Worked example 1C–3.

WORKED
EXAMPLE 1C–3
Using the reaction from Worked example 1C–2, determine the mass of carbon
monoxide that would be produced. We will start from the beginning and add extra steps
at the end to show how this question could be done in its entirety.
Solution
Logic Write a balanced equation for
the reaction.
Process
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
Step 1 Step 2 Write the relevant information
provided in the question under
the equation.
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
m = 8.0 g m = 16.0 g
Step 3 Calculate the amount, in mol,
of each reactant.
n(CH4) = m
M
n(CH4) = 8.0 g
16.0 g mol–1
n(CH4) = 0.50 mol
n(O2) = m
M
n(O2) = 16.0 g
32.0 g mol–1
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
Step 4 Based on the moles present
of one reactant, work out how
much would be required of the
other, based on the mole ratio
in the equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 2 : 3
0.50 mol of O2 would react with 0.33 mol
of CH4.
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the
second reagent is more or less
than what is required from
Step 3.
0.33 mol of CH4 required
0.50 mol of CH4 present
CH4 present > CH4 required
Step 6 State the limiting reagent. Step 7 Use the number of moles of the
limiting reagent and the mole
ratio to calculate the number of
moles of the desired product.
As there is more CH4 present than required,
CH4 is the excess reagent, making O2 the
limiting reagent.
n(O2) : n(CO) = 3 : 2
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
n(C0 produced) = 2
× 0.50 = 0.33 mol
3
Step 8 Use n =
m
to calculate the
M
mass in grams produced.
n(CO) = m
M
m(CO) = n × M
m(CO) = 0.33 mol × 28.0 g mol–1
m(CO produced) = 9.3 g
Linking this back to combustion reactions, we can now understand the main difference
between complete and incomplete combustion and summarise it as follows:
• complete combustion: the fuel is the limiting reagent, oxygen is the excess reagent
• incomplete combustion: the fuel is the excess reagent, oxygen is the limiting reagent.

Representing and analysing energy profile diagrams
Being able to draw fully labelled energy profile diagrams is an important skill for
assessments. However, you also need to be able to explain what each part of the energy
profile diagram represents, as well as connect this to key chemistry terms for this topic.
Consider the example shown below.
Energy from the environment
required to break bonds in
the reactant(s)
Energy released to the
environment in the forming
of bonds in the product(s)
Activation energy (Ea)
*The double-headed arrow must extend
from the base energy of the reactants to the
peak of the graph. Therefore, it is good to
include a dotted line using a ruler.*
Energy

Products
Enthalpy change, ( H ), representing
the difference in energy between the
reactants and the products
Progress of reaction
Initial energy stored
in the reactants
Final energy stored
in the products
An energy profile diagram like the one above could be given to you in a question. The
following are some example tasks that you may be asked to complete:
• Label the activation energy (answer shown in purple above).
• Label OR explain the enthalpy change (answer shown in orange above).
• Describe why the amount of energy increases initially in the energy profile diagram
(answer shown in green above).
• Describe why the amount of energy decreases following the top of the peak in the energy
profile diagram (answer shown in blue above).
Note, when labelling the activation energy or enthalpy change you need to be precise
with placement of arrows otherwise you will lose marks. Using a ruler to draw a dotted
horizontal line makes this labelling easier.
Another question may be: Does the energy profile diagram represent an exothermic or
an endothermic reaction? Justify your reasoning.
For this question, you should note that as this is a 50:50 choice, you do not get a mark
for making the correct selection. The term ‘justify’ means you need to provide evidence/
reasons why the energy profile diagram is exothermic or why it is not endothermic. As
such, if this was a 2-mark question, your answer should look as follows:
Exothermic (no mark)
The energy of the products is lower than the energy of the reactants (1 mark) OR the
enthalpy change (ΔH) is negative. (1 mark)
Whereas, for endothermic reactions the energy of the products is higher than the energy of
the reactants OR the enthalpy change (ΔH) is positive. (1 mark)

Short-answer questions
11 Concerns from society about the rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions are continuing
to drive our focus on aspects of different types of fuels. Coal is one of Australia’s largest
exports; however, the mining and burning of coal is a major contributor to our greenhouse
gas emissions.
a List the two forms of greenhouse gases that are released from the plant remains
during the formation of coal. (1 mark)
b What conditions help to cause the release of these greenhouse gas emissions
from the coal beds? c Coal is an example of a fossil fuel. Explain why, by comparing this to biofuels. (1 mark)
(2 marks)
In the Latrobe Valley, east of Melbourne, an electricity generation company is
planning to replace a thermal power station fired by brown coal with a thermal
plant fired by natural gas. Natural gas offers many potential benefits because it
results in the release of less greenhouse gases.
d Using your knowledge of natural gas, explain why less greenhouse gases
are emitted. (2 marks)
e Would you say that natural gas is renewable? Explain. (1 mark)
f Is the burning of natural gas an example of an exothermic or an endothermic
reaction? Explain. (2 marks)

g One issue with the location of the natural gas plant further from Melbourne
is that more energy is lost in the transmission of electricity through power lines
than the amount of energy lost by the flow of gas in pipelines. What is one
potential solution to this problem for the electricity company? h Outline why biogas is considered an example of a renewable energy resource. (1 mark)

12 Bioethanol is primarily produced by the fermentation of glucose and sucrose
by yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or bacteria, such as Escherichia coli.
a Define ‘fermentation’ and include both a word equation and a balanced
chemical equation illustrating the type of fermentation Saccharomyces
cerevisiae would carry out. (3 marks)
b Bioethanol production can also use starch from corn. However, biomass
of this sort must be pretreated prior to fermentation. Define ‘biomass’. (1 mark)
c Outline one advantage and one disadvantage with the use of bioethanol
compared with petrol. (2 marks)
13 In the presence of oxygen, plants and animals can perform aerobic cellular respiration.
Writing balanced chemical equations, explain how the processes of aerobic cellular
respiration and photosynthesis are linked. (3 marks)
14 Propane is a common fuel used in portable burners, such as those found in
camp stoves. In certain situations, there is not enough ventilation for the fuel
to burn completely. This can be quite dangerous, as it leads to the production
of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that can
be poisonous if inhaled in large enough quantities. This is one reason why camp
stoves have warnings not to be used inside a tent, as the carbon monoxide
can build up quite quickly and lead to unconsciousness and death.
a Write a balanced chemical equation for the incomplete combustion reaction of
propane occurring at 25°C and 100 kPa, assuming that carbon monoxide is
the only carbon-based product formed. (2 marks)
b Describe how you know that oxygen will be the limiting reactant in this
reaction. (1 mark)
c A standard camping stove comes with 468 g of propane gas in a canister.
If this is burned in the presence of 1050 g of oxygen gas, determine the
mass (in g) of carbon monoxide that will be produced. d Determine the mass of fuel that remains following the reaction. e Calculate the energy released in MJ. f Draw a fully labelled energy profile diagram for this reaction. (2 marks)

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can write and interpret the balanced equation for photosynthesis
CODE: 1B.2

WHAT (concept explanation):
The photosynthesis equation is 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(l) → C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(g), requiring light energy and chlorophyll. It shows the mole ratio of 6:6:1:6 for reactants and products.

WHY (importance):
This equation allows calculation of reactant requirements and product yields, and demonstrates the stoichiometric relationships in biological energy transformation.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
To produce 180 g of glucose (1 mol), plants require 264 g of carbon dioxide (6 mol) and 108 g of water (6 mol), releasing 192 g of oxygen (6 mol).

SUBTOPIC: Chemical Energy in Nature
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic examines how plants and animals produce and transform energy through photosynthesis and cellular respiration. It covers the chemical equations, conditions, and relationship between these complementary biological processes.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: These processes form the foundation of energy flow in ecosystems and are the basis for all biofuels. Understanding them connects light energy to usable chemical energy and explains how organisms meet their energy needs.

TOPIC: Carbon-Based Fuels
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Exploration of fossil fuels and biofuels, their production, renewability, and energy transformations. Includes photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and thermochemical analysis of combustion reactions.

CARBON-BASED FUELS
Introduction
This chapter begins your exploration of energy and some of the different types of
fuel used to generate energy for society. You will compare various types of fossil
fuels and biofuels, including how they are sourced, produced and used in society,
while understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each. You will also look
at the processes by which plants and animals convert the energy contained within
light and food into usable forms of chemical energy. You will learn about reactions that
either release or absorb heat energy, as well as how to represent these diagrammatically.
Finally, you will look at calculating the quantity of energy released from the combustion
of fuels and explore the concepts of limiting and excess reagents for these types of reactions.

ENGAGE
Australia’s first petrol-driven car
When Harley Tarrant was young, his
father owned the Clunes Gazette, the
St Kilda Chronicle and the Prahran
Chronicle. As such, Harley was
surrounded by information from overseas
publications, and from these articles he
learned about, and became obsessed
with, cars.
Later, when working on the Nullarbor
Plain as a surveyor, he determined
that steam and electric vehicles would
not be suitable to tackle the harsh
Australian outback. In 1897, he decided
to build a kerosene engine with bicycle-
maker, Howard Lewis. Due to the high
Figure 1A–1 The vehicle shown in this photo is
the first two-seater, two-cylinder petrol engine
automobile built and sold in Australia, by
Harley Tarrant and Howard Lewis in 1901.
temperature at which kerosene vaporises,
it was not suitable as a fuel for a car engine, but it was ideal for pumping water. His engine
sold extremely well across Australia, providing him funding to continue working on a
suitable fuel and engine for an automobile.
Following this, Tarrant and Lewis set out to build their own petrol-driven car, which
used an imported Benz engine. After successfully developing a two-cylinder petrol
motor car in 1901, they refined it further with their own locally made engine. At the
time, they decided to sacrifice speed for a car that would thrive in Australian conditions.
Since then, and especially recently, the use of different fuels has continued to evolve
from fossil fuels to biofuels, and now the push to fully electric vehicles. Fossil fuels and
biofuels, with a focus on their renewability, are discussed further in this section.

EXPLAIN
What are fuels and why do we need them?
Likely, when you hear the word ‘fuel’, you think about petrol, diesel or coal used to power
planes, trains and automobiles. However, as you will see later in this chapter, food, such as
sugar, is also used as a fuel for our bodies.
Fuels are both organic and inorganic substances capable of storing chemical energy. In this
section, we will look at only organic fuels. As you will see in Section 1C, when a fuel is
burned, the stored chemical energy is released as heat (thermal) energy, which can then be
further used to power objects.
You should be familiar with the units of energy from earlier years in science. The
International System of Units (SI) unit for energy is the joule, J.
Fossil fuels
Fossil fuels are mostly hydrocarbons, with some other minor impurities, as you learned
about in Unit 1 and will learn more about in Unit 4. They are called ‘fossil’ fuels, as they
are formed through the fossilised remains and subsequent decay of plants, animals and
microorganisms, which lived millions of years ago. The hydrocarbon remains are extracted
through mining and the drilling of wells both on land and at sea. These remains still contain
some of the chemical energy that the plants, and the plants consumed by animals at the
time, originally stored from transforming light energy from the Sun when carrying out
photosynthesis. Photosynthesis as a chemical process will be covered further in Section 1B.
Fossil fuels are non-renewable, meaning their availability is limited and they are being
consumed at a rate faster than they are being produced. As these fossil fuels are formed over
millions of years, once they are depleted, they will not be replaced any time soon.
Fossil fuels can be separated into three main categories: coal, natural gas and petroleum.

Coal
Coal is a layer of sedimentary rock formed underground, containing mostly plant remains,
that are then buried by further sediments. It is formed under low oxygen conditions at
high temperatures and pressures over millions of years. Coal formations are called ‘coal
beds’ and they exist globally. The deeper the coal bed, the higher its rank, where the
ranking is based on how much it has changed over time. Deeper underground, the plant
matter experiences higher temperatures and pressures, and so more of the plant remains
are transformed into carbon, while water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane
(CH4) escape. The methane that is produced is trapped as coal seam gas. The higher the
percentage of carbon, the better the coal fuel source.
Flooding led to the
burial of plant matter
beneath soil
Dead plant matter was

pressures and temperatures

Figure 1A–3 The formation and existence of different coal layers
Coal is the most abundant of the fossil fuels and is the largest fuel source used for
generating electricity in the world. Coal is Australia’s largest energy resource. It is mined in
every state in Australia, with the largest black coal resources located in New South Wales
and Queensland. As Figure 1A–3 shows, black coal is buried deeper than other layers of
coal, but because of the heat efficiency it provides, it is much more economical for mining.
Approximately 70% of the coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to eastern Asian
regions. In 2019, pre-COVID, coal exploration expenditure was $229 million, which was

Natural gas
Natural gas is mostly methane (CH4), with traces of other small hydrocarbons, such as
ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10). Other substances including water,
carbon dioxide, sulfur and nitrogen can also be present in the gas reservoirs.
You will recall that in the formation of coal, the increased pressure and temperature
resulted in the physical and chemical change of the sedimentary rock, releasing methane,
carbon dioxide and water.
Likewise, this pressure causes the natural gas found in rock formations to adsorb to the
surface of the coal. When drilling wells fracture coal deposits, natural gas flows to the
surface, as shown in Figure 1A–4. This process is called fracking. A fracking fluid is injected
into the well to increase the permeability of the sediment, allowing an easier flow of gas to
the surface. The fracking fluid contains sand, water and other chemicals. A chemical once
used in fracking fluid was benzene, which you will learn about in Section 8B. However, this
has been banned in Australia because it is carcinogenic, and there is a potential risk of it
escaping and contaminating water supplies. Sand is convenient as a component of this fluid
because it is often present at the site of drilling. However, water is not, and so this has to
be transported to the drilling sites, which is environmentally unfriendly and economically
costly.
One of the environmental concerns associated with fracking is that it releases methane, a
greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. It is predicted that approximately 4–8% leaks to the
atmosphere from the well head, pipelines and storage facilities.

Petroleum
In Unit 1, you learned about crude oil as being a mixture of predominantly alkanes, which
are organic hydrocarbon molecules. Like coal and natural gas, crude oil is formed from
plant and animal remains that decay over millions of years. However, crude oil is not as
widespread or as easy to access as coal and natural gas.
Crude oil is essentially petrol (petroleum). However, because the crude oil mixture contains
many hydrocarbons with varying sizes (based on their number of carbon atoms), it is not
useful to mine and use directly once drilled and brought to the surface. The crude oil
first needs to be separated into its various hydrocarbon fractions in a process called
fractional distillation.
Fractional distillation works on the fundamental basis that different-sized hydrocarbons
can be separated from each other because of their different boiling points, something you
learned in Unit 1 and will again cover in Section 10B. Countries in the Middle East are the
main sources and exporters of crude oil, including petrol, internationally. Australia, being
one of their trade partners, imports 90% of all the crude oil it uses. Australia does have a few
small crude oil reserves off the coast of northern Western Australia, South Australia and
Bass Strait; however, these are likely to be depleted by 2100.

Biofuels
While fossil fuels take millions of years to produce, and are being used up at a faster rate
than which they are being replenished, biofuels are the opposite. Biofuels are classified
as renewable because they can be produced at the same rate at which they are consumed.
As the name suggests, they are produced from living (hence, bio) matter, called biomass.
There are three types of biofuels covered in this chapter: biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel.
Figure 1A–5 shows the proportion of feedstocks in total biofuel production. As you will see

Biogas
Biogas is formed from the breakdown of organic biological waste, such as plant matter,
by anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria are those that thrive in the absence of oxygen.
The bacteria break down complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose and starch, as well as
proteins, into simpler molecules. The contents and percentage of these simpler molecules
will depend on the starting organic material that is being decomposed. Approximate
percentages are shown in Table 1A–1.

As you can see from the biogas cycle shown in Figure 1A–6, the original solar energy is
captured by crops and transformed into chemical energy by photosynthesis, which will
be explored in Section 1B. For large-scale production, the organic waste produced from
harvesting crops, food waste and animal by-products is placed in a large tank called a
digester. The digester is filled with anaerobic bacteria. Waste from this process can be used
as a good biofertiliser and the biogas produced is useful for heating and electricity in homes
and farms. This cycle further highlights the renewability and low impact of greenhouse
gas emissions for this process.

large-scale biogas plant was announced for Nowra, in NSW. According to the Australian
Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), the estimated biogas potential would place Australia
on par with Germany, a leading country in the production of biogas.

Ethanol can be manufactured by the addition reaction of ethene with steam. You will
encounter this reaction again in Section 9A.
More commonly and naturally, ethanol is produced in plants and yeast that undergo
anaerobic fermentation. Typical crops grown globally for ethanol production include corn,
maize and wheat, but Australia has a long history of fermenting native plants. The Palawa
people of Tasmania have a history of using the sap of a cider gum to make the sweet
fermented drink wayalinah, and the Noongar people in south-western Australia have
fermented the fruit of the macrozamia plant (known as by-yu or kwineen) as a method of
detoxification and to enhance its nutritional value.

The main feedstock used in Australia for producing bioethanol is wheat. Facilities are
currently located in both New South Wales and Queensland, with plans for a large-scale
facility to operate in regional Victoria in the future.
In wheat and other first-generation feedstocks, biological catalysts called enzymes speed
up the breakdown of cellulose and starch to sucrose. Yeast is then added to this solution.
The yeast contains another enzyme called invertase, which helps convert the sucrose into
glucose. The glucose then binds with another enzyme in the yeast called zymase, which
assists the final step of fermentation into ethanol (bioethanol) and carbon dioxide according
to the following equation.
glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide
C6H12O6(aq) → 2CH3CH2OH(aq) + 2CO2(g)
Notice that the ethanol produced from fermentation is in an aqueous (aq) state. This
means that it is not pure and is hydrated by water molecules. These water molecules are
removed by distillation, which will be covered in more detail in Section 10B.

If you’ve got your learner permit or probationary licence and have driven to fill the car up
at the petrol station, you will have noticed the fuel pump labelled ‘E10’. It is called E10 as
it contains a blend of 90% petrol and 10% ethanol. The addition of ethanol to petrol has
several advantages, including:
• the use of petrol derived from crude oil is reduced
• the fuel is oxygenated so that it burns more completely
• the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is reduced
• the source of the bioethanol makes it a more sustainable transport fuel.
Biodiesel
Biodiesel is a mixture of organic compounds produced from vegetable oils, cooking oils
and animal fats. Because it is produced from plant and/or animal products, it is renewable
and often called ‘green diesel’. A transesterification reaction between plant and/or animal
triglycerides (fats, oils) and alcohol, typically methanol (CH3OH), results in a mixture
of methyl esters, or biodiesel. You will learn more about transesterification reactions in
Section 9B; however, an example reaction is shown in Figure 1A–8 below. Note that this
reaction also requires the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
acting as a catalyst. Biodiesel production in this way requires less energy and has less
emissions than producing bioethanol.

The other product in the transesterification reaction, glycerol, is commonly used in the
manufacture of pharmaceuticals. You will learn more about medicinal chemistry in Chapter 12.
If you look back at Figure 1A–5 on page 10, you will see that a large number of the
feedstocks used in biofuel production are vegetable oils, used for biodiesels.
There are currently three biodiesel plants operating in Australia. However, after peaking in
the mid-2010s, they now operate at less than 40% capacity. With only around 0.2% blend
rate with standard diesel, it is a fuel with very little focus in Australia. Globally, biodiesel
can be used in most existing diesel engines without them needing further modifications.
Like bioethanol, these blends are also labelled at the pump, typically as B5 or B20,
indicating a 5% or 20% blend, respectively, of biodiesel with standard diesel.

Coal • Mined easily
• Large reserves remaining
• Cheap
• Can be converted to liquid and

While biofuels might seem like a better alternative to fossil fuels, their increasing use in
the immediate future raises a number of other important implications that need to be
considered and managed, including:
• how much land degradation and forest destruction occurs to grow crops
• the percentage of crops grown for fuel versus that grown for food to meet the needs of
increasing population sizes.
Research is underway to look at the potential for either algae or agave crops to be used as a
feedstock for biodiesel production. The latter thrives in dry, arid desert environments with
little water and produces a high oil yield. Therefore, land required for growing food would
not be compromised.

QUESTIONS
Comparison-based questions
In this section, you were presented with six different types of fuels. You learned
about how and where each was sourced from, the chemical processes used in their
production and their respective advantages and disadvantages. As such, it is predictable
that assessment questions will require you to compare various aspects of different
combinations of these fuels. In comparison or contrast questions, you are required to
explain both the similarities and differences of each item in the question. Let’s look at an
example question, which has been adapted from the 2021 VCAA Exam and solution.
Question
Digesters use bacteria to convert organic waste into biogas. Both biogas and coal seam
gas have the same hydrocarbon as their main component. Referring specifically to this
hydrocarbon, compare biogas and coal seam gas.
VCAA 2021
Answer
Similarities:
Both are types of fuels that contain mainly methane, CH4.
Differences:
• Coal seam gas is non-renewable as it originally comes from the increased
temperature and pressure experienced by sedimentary rock deeper below Earth’s
surface and is not produced at a rate equal to or faster than it is consumed.
• On the other hand, biogas is renewable, as it is produced from the breakdown of plant
matter, in particular cellulose and starch, by bacteria under anaerobic conditions.
Notice that in this answer, the comparison word ‘whereas’ was used to differentiate
between the difference of the two fuels.
This was just one example for two fuels covered in this chapter, but other examples
may require you to compare two different types of fossil fuels or two different types of
biofuels, the advantages and/or disadvantages of different fuels or their renewability.
Developing a clear set of notes with what makes each distinct from the other will be
important for this section.

The carbon economy
Have you heard of the carbon economy? Perhaps you’re more familiar with the term
‘carbon footprint’. Both of these relate to carbon dioxide emissions. As you learned in
Unit 2, carbon dioxide emissions (a type of greenhouse gas) are primarily responsible
for global warming and climate change. Carbon dioxide is released naturally through
processes like cellular respiration, which you will learn more about in this chapter,
and fermentation. However, other human activities, such as deforestation and the
burning of fossil fuels, which you will learn more about in Section 1C, have been the
main producers of the gas. For decades, efforts have been made to monitor and lower
these emissions. Governments and industries are continually improving the efficiency
of photosynthesis, which is the way carbon dioxide is naturally removed from the
atmosphere. The benefits of this improvement will be twofold. The world’s population
is growing rapidly and greater quantities of food will be needed to support future
generations. Not only will there be less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but it is
thought that increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis will mean more nutrient-rich
crops and increased crop yields. Governments and industries also want to increase
the production of biomass, a sustainable and renewable energy resource, in the hope
that this will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and again reduce the volume of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.

EXPLAIN
Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is an anabolic chemical reaction in which the Sun’s light energy is used to
convert the inorganic compounds carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into the organic
compound glucose (C6H12O6). Glucose can then be used as a source of energy by the cells
of living organisms, enabling growth and reproduction.
Photosynthesis consists of a series of steps (a biochemical pathway), with each step
controlled by a different enzyme. The overall process of photosynthesis can be written as
both a word equation and a balanced chemical equation:

The oxygen released is

for cellular respiration in both
plants and animals. The glucose
produced from photosynthesis
in plants is the key reactant
required for cellular respiration
in living organisms, as you
will see later in this chapter.
As you learned in Section 1A,
glucose is also the key input for
fermentation in the production
of bioethanol from plants
and yeast.
Photosynthesis is an example
of an endothermic reaction,
which you will learn about in

2 a Write the word equation for photosynthesis.
b Write the simplified balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis.
Cellular respiration
Like photosynthesis, cellular respiration occurs as a series of steps in a biochemical
pathway, with each step controlled by a different enzyme. You do not need to be familiar
with any of these steps in this chemistry course. The purpose of cellular respiration is the
catabolic breakdown of glucose, which releases the chemical energy in a form more usable
for cells, as a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
There are two types of cellular respiration. The first occurs in the absence of oxygen
(anaerobic) and is commonly referred to as fermentation. You learned about this in
Section 1A. This occurs in certain plants and yeast, resulting in the production of ethanol
(bioethanol) and carbon dioxide, according to the following equation:
glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide
C6H12O6(aq) → 2CH3CH2OH(aq) + 2CO2(g)
In animals, a slightly different form of anaerobic cellular respiration takes place. It is often
called lactic acid fermentation and results in the production of lactic acid (lactate ions),
which is associated with muscle cramping. This chemical reaction is represented according
to the following equation:

The second form of cellular respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen (aerobic). This
occurs in many plant and animal cells with some steps occurring inside the mitochondria,
the energy powerhouse of the cell. Aerobic cellular respiration results in a much greater
yield of energy per mole of glucose than that yielded by anaerobic cellular respiration.

You will recall from Unit 2, and this will again be covered in Section 3A, that oxidation
means a loss of electrons. If you look at the oxidation numbers, in red, shown above the
balanced chemical equation, you will see that the carbon changes from a ‘0’ to a ‘+4’
oxidation number. This means it is losing electrons. Conversely, the oxygen gas reactant is
being reduced, as it changes oxidation number from ‘0’ to ‘+2’.
As glucose can be broken down to release the energy required for all metabolic reactions
occurring in our bodies’ cells, it is a type of fuel. Like the other fuels you learned about in
Section 1A, it undergoes a combustion reaction that releases energy, which means it is an
exothermic reaction. Exothermic combustion reactions will be discussed in more detail in
Section 1C.
As in photosynthesis, there are many factors which affect the rate of cellular respiration
reactions, such as temperature, glucose availability, oxygen concentration and enzyme
(catalyst) concentration. Factors affecting the frequency and success of collisions between
reactants, and the subsequent rate of chemical reactions, are explored further in Section 5B.

Figure 1B–4 The complementary nature of the photosynthesis and cellular respiration reactions
means that carbon, hydrogen and oxygen cycle through organisms and their environments continually.
Referring to Figure 1B–4, note the following key points.
• Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, an organelle found only in the cells of green
plants and algae.
• The products of photosynthesis (oxygen and glucose) are used as reactants in the
process of aerobic cellular respiration.
• Aerobic cellular respiration occurs mostly in mitochondria, organelles found in
animal, plant and fungal cells, and protists.
• Aerobic cellular respiration uses the products of photosynthesis to produce ATP,
an energy storage molecule, which can then release energy to meet the cell’s
requirements.
• In plants, the products of aerobic cellular respiration (water and carbon dioxide) can
then be used as reactants in the process of photosynthesis.
• Although photosynthesis appears to be the reverse of cellular respiration, the
processes are different and use different enzymes. (You will learn in general about
enzymes in Section 12B.)
Using the Study Design to guide your preparation
The most important way of determining the detail you need to know is by looking at
the Study Design and completing many practice questions. Keep focused on the terms
used in the Study Design dot points and, when making notes, always use the dot points,
or part of the dot points, as your headings. The Study Design was written specifically to
cover what you need to know, and the success criteria have been written to guide you
through the necessary material.
For example, the Study Design requires you to know that photosynthesis is a source of
both glucose and oxygen, which are required for respiration in living things, and that it is
in these living things where the glucose is oxidised as the primary energy source.

What do composting vegetable waste and burning a candle have in common? While
it may seem like the answer should be ‘not much at all’, they are in fact linked as they
both involve chemical reactions that release heat into the environment! In this section,
you are going to gain an understanding of two different types of reactions and how they
either release or absorb heat from the environment. You will also investigate a specific
type of exothermic reaction, called combustion reactions, as a way of obtaining energy
from fuels. Lastly, you will learn how to draw energy profile diagrams to represent the
reactions occurring during these processes.

1C EXOTHERMIC AND ENDOTHERMIC REACTIONS

EXPLAIN
Exothermic and endothermic reactions
For a chemical reaction to occur, the bonds within the reactants must first be broken.
This requires energy and the exact quantity of energy is specific for each reaction. Every
reaction has a minimum amount of energy that is needed for the reaction to occur –
this is known as the activation energy and is represented by the symbol E
. As a reaction
a
proceeds, new bonds must be formed to generate the products. Unlike breaking bonds,
this process releases energy. This can be summarised by the following statements:
Breaking bonds: requires energy from the environment
Forming bonds: releases energy to the environment
The chemical energy of a substance is called its enthalpy or heat content and has the
symbol H. The overall change in energy from reactants to products is known as the
enthalpy change (ΔH). The enthalpy change indicates whether more energy was required
to break the reactant bonds than was released forming the product bonds or vice versa. It
can be represented by the equation:
Δ H(reaction) = Σ H(reactant bonds broken) – Σ H(product bonds formed)
From this equation, we can see that there are two possible outcomes.
1 The energy required to break the bonds of the reactants is greater than the energy
released from forming the bonds in the products. In this instance, the ΔH will be
positive, and the reaction is referred to as an endothermic reaction.
2 The energy required to break the bonds of the reactants is less than the energy released
from forming the bonds in the products. In this instance, the ΔH will be negative, and
the reaction is referred to as an exothermic reaction.
Exothermic and endothermic reactions can be illustrated using energy profile diagrams
(Figure 1C–1).

Calculating the value for the enthalpy change of a reaction can be important in
understanding the energy content of fuels and foods. This will be covered in more depth
in Section 2B.
It is important to note that in an exothermic reaction, where the ΔH is negative, the
products are at a lower energy level than the reactants. This means that in an exothermic
reaction the products are more stable than the reactants.
It is the opposite when considering an endothermic reaction, where the ΔH is positive.
In these reactions, the reactants, which are at a lower energy level than the products, are
more stable.
Key points and differences between exothermic and endothermic reactions are summarised
in Table 1C–2.

Combustion of fuels
Earlier in this chapter, we discussed fuels as sources of energy. To obtain energy from these
types of fuels, they must undergo combustion reactions. Combustion reactions involve
reacting an organic fuel in the presence of oxygen gas, and produce carbon dioxide, water
and heat energy. As heat energy is released as part of these reactions, all combustion
reactions are exothermic.
Knowledge of combustion reactions means they can be employed in society’s favour. This
can allow for more efficient consumption of petrol in a car or to maximise the energy
produced in thermal power plants. With the increasing severity of bushfires in Australia,
there has been a growing resurgence of interest in examining the techniques of First
Nations cultural (or cool) burning, the oldest known farming practice in the world. First
Nations rangers and traditional owners in the Kimberley region in northern Western
Australia perform targeted burnings during the early dry season (March to July) to
minimise the most dangerous season for bushfires (August to November).
Combustion reactions can be represented by thermochemical equations, which not only
show the reactants and products of the reaction, but also the energy released.
Let’s start by writing the balanced equation for the complete combustion of methane:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
The first thing that you might notice in the above equation is that water is present in
the gaseous state (that is, as water vapour), rather than as a liquid. This is because all
combustion reactions occur at high temperatures that are above the boiling point of water.
This equation, however, is not a thermochemical equation. For this, we need to add in the
enthalpy change data for the combustion of methane. For many common fuels, the heat of
combustion has been determined experimentally, and the values are provided in the VCAA
Data Book. Using this, we see that the heat of combustion for methane is given as 55.6 kJ g–1
or 890 kJ mol–1. This can then be added to our balanced equation to give us a complete
thermochemical equation as follows:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) ΔH = –890 kJ mol–1

NOTE
You will notice that in the thermochemical equation, the state for the water produced is now
liquid (l). This is because all reactants and products must be in their standard states at SLC
(standard laboratory conditions; 25ºC, 100 kPa).
With this information, it is possible to calculate the quantity of heat released from
the combustion of methane in almost any given situation at 25ºC and 100 kPa. This
thermochemical equation tells us that the combustion of one mole of methane releases
890 kJ of energy. If two moles of methane underwent combustion, 1780 kJ of energy (that is,
2 × 890) would be released. You will learn more about how to perform these calculations
in Section 2A. In these instances, we are assuming that the fuel continues to react until
it is all gone. This is true if the reaction takes place with an abundance of oxygen gas;
however, this isn’t always the case. If the oxygen is depleted before the fuel, the reaction
is known as incomplete combustion. Due to the lack of oxygen present, different carbon-
containing products are formed from this reaction: solid carbon, carbon monoxide gas

and carbon dioxide gas. Shown below is one possible equation for the incomplete
combustion of methane, where carbon monoxide, rather than carbon dioxide, is the only
carbon-containing product generated:
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(l)
If incomplete combustion occurs, the energy released will be less than if complete
combustion occurs. To determine whether complete or incomplete combustion will occur in
certain circumstances, we need to understand the concept of limiting and excess reagents.
NOTE
In some cases of incomplete combustion, solid carbon, C(s), is also produced as a product. This
can be observed as soot.
Limiting and excess reagents
In Unit 2, you learned about a variety of different applications where you may be required

of mole ratios, which are represented by the coefficients in a chemical equation and provide

information about the relative amounts of each compound needed for the reaction to occur.
In a way, this is similar to how a recipe provides instructions on the different quantities of
ingredients required to make a meal or bake a cake.
Let’s look at part of a hypothetical recipe for a banana cake. As well as other ingredients, the
recipe says that to make one cake we need:
• 3 bananas
• 2 eggs
• 1 cup of milk.
Pantry 1 Pantry 2 Pantry 3
Figure 1C–2 Using cake ingredients to model
mole ratios
We can essentially express this in the same way that we would a
balanced chemical reaction:
3 bananas + 2 eggs + 1 cup of milk → 1 banana cake
This shows us that the numbers (or coefficients) in front of each
ingredient provide the ratio required to make our product, the
banana cake. Now let’s look at the ingredients contained within
three potential pantries (Figure 1C–2).
Referring to our original recipe equation, we need: 3 bananas,
2 eggs and 1 cup of milk.
For each pantry, our equation looks like this:
Pantry 1: 3 bananas + 2 eggs + 1 cup of milk → ? banana cakes
Pantry 2: 3 bananas + 4 eggs + 2 cups of milk → ? banana cakes
Pantry 3: 6 bananas + 3 eggs + 2 cups of milk → ? banana cakes
In each instance, you can see that we need to work out the total
number of banana cakes that we can make from the ingredients
that we have.
In pantry 1, we have the exact number of each ingredient required by the original recipe to
make a single banana cake.

In pantry 2, we can see that we have double the number of eggs and double the number
of cups of milk required to make a single banana cake. However, if we wanted to make
two banana cakes, we would also need 6 bananas. We only have 3 bananas in this pantry,
which is only enough to make 1 banana cake. In this instance, the bananas are our limiting
ingredient (or reagent). In contrast, the eggs and milk will both be present in excess.
In pantry 3, we can see that we have double the number of bananas and double the
number of cups of milk required to make a single banana cake. However, if we wanted to
make 2 banana cakes, we would also need 4 eggs. While we have more eggs than we need
to make a single cake (2 eggs), we still have less than we need to make 2 cakes (4 eggs).
This means that in this pantry, the eggs are our limiting ingredient and the bananas and
milk will both be present in excess.
From this example, it should be clear that we can only make as many cakes as our limiting
ingredient allows. By applying our ingredient ratios to pantry 3 and only focusing on the
limiting ingredient, we can calculate the following:
2 eggs: 1 cake
3 eggs: 1.5 cakes
While this example may have just made you crave banana cake, it also illustrates perfectly
the concept of limiting and excess reagents and how they can be used to calculate the
theoretical amount of product that can be generated from a chemical reaction.
Let’s now look at a specific worked example using the combustion of methane.

reaction.
Solution
Logic Process
Step 1 Write a balanced equation for the
reaction.
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
Step 2 Write the relevant information provided
in the question under the equation.
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
n(CH4) = 2.0 mol; n(O2) = 6.0 mol
Step 3 Calculate the number of moles of
each reactant using coefficients in the
equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 1 : 2
So, 2 mol of CH4 would react with
4 mol of O2.
Step 4 Based on the moles present of one
reactant, work out how much would
be required of the other, based on the
mole ratio in the equation.
4 mol of O2 required

As you can see in Worked example 1C–1, the oxygen is in excess and so this will lead to
complete combustion. You can also see from this example that we need to know the moles
of each reactant to determine the limiting and excess reagents. However, if you are given a
mass, as in the following example, you need to complete an extra step.

EXAMPLE 1C–2
Worked example 1C–2: Determining the limiting reagent in moles
Methane (CH4) reacts in the presence of oxygen (O2) to produce carbon monoxide (CO)
and water (H2O). Initially, 8.0 g of methane and 16.0 g of oxygen are present. Determine
the limiting reagent in this reaction.
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write a balanced equation for
the reaction.
Process
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
Step 2 Write the relevant information
provided in the question under
the equation.
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
m = 8.0 g m = 16.0 g
Step 3 Calculate the amount, in mol,
of each reactant.
n(CH4) = m
M
n(CH4) = 8.0 g
16.0 g mol–1
n(CH4) = 0.50 mol
n(O2) = m
M
n(O2) = 16.0 g
32.0 g mol–1
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
Step 4 Based on the moles present
of one reactant, work out how
much would be required of the
other, based on the mole ratio
in the equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 2 : 3
0.50 mol of O2 would react with 0.33 mol
of CH4.
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the
second reagent is more or less
than what is required from
Step 3.
0.33 mol of CH4 required
0.50 mol of CH4 present
CH4 present > CH4 required
Step 6 State the limiting reagent. As there is more CH4 present than required,
CH4 is the excess reagent, making O2 the
limiting reagent.
Lastly, once we have determined the limiting reagent, we can also use this information
to calculate the amount or mass of a product, or the quantity of heat in the case of
combustion, that is generated from the reaction. This type of question is illustrated in
Worked example 1C–3.

EXAMPLE 1C–3
Using the reaction from Worked example 1C–2, determine the mass of carbon

at the end to show how this question could be done in its entirety.
Solution
Logic Write a balanced equation for
the reaction.
Process
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
Step 1 Step 2 Write the relevant information
provided in the question under
the equation.
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
m = 8.0 g m = 16.0 g
Step 3 Calculate the amount, in mol,
of each reactant.
n(CH4) = m
M
n(CH4) = 8.0 g
16.0 g mol–1
n(CH4) = 0.50 mol
n(O2) = m
M
n(O2) = 16.0 g
32.0 g mol–1
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
Step 4 Based on the moles present
of one reactant, work out how
much would be required of the
other, based on the mole ratio
in the equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 2 : 3
0.50 mol of O2 would react with 0.33 mol
of CH4.
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the
second reagent is more or less
than what is required from
Step 3.
0.33 mol of CH4 required
0.50 mol of CH4 present
CH4 present > CH4 required
Step 6 State the limiting reagent. Step 7 Use the number of moles of the
limiting reagent and the mole
ratio to calculate the number of
moles of the desired product.
As there is more CH4 present than required,
CH4 is the excess reagent, making O2 the
limiting reagent.
n(O2) : n(CO) = 3 : 2
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
n(C0 produced) = 2
× 0.50 = 0.33 mol
3
Step 8 Use n =
m
to calculate the
M
mass in grams produced.
n(CO) = m
M
m(CO) = n × M
m(CO) = 0.33 mol × 28.0 g mol–1
m(CO produced) = 9.3 g
Linking this back to combustion reactions, we can now understand the main difference
between complete and incomplete combustion and summarise it as follows:
• complete combustion: the fuel is the limiting reagent, oxygen is the excess reagent
• incomplete combustion: the fuel is the excess reagent, oxygen is the limiting reagent.

1C SKILLS
Representing and analysing energy profile diagrams
Being able to draw fully labelled energy profile diagrams is an important skill for
assessments. However, you also need to be able to explain what each part of the energy
profile diagram represents, as well as connect this to key chemistry terms for this topic.
Consider the example shown below.
Energy from the environment
required to break bonds in
the reactant(s)
Energy released to the
environment in the forming
of bonds in the product(s)
Activation energy (Ea)
*The double-headed arrow must extend
from the base energy of the reactants to the
peak of the graph. Therefore, it is good to
include a dotted line using a ruler.*
Energy
Reactants
Products
Enthalpy change, ( H ), representing
the difference in energy between the
reactants and the products
Progress of reaction
Initial energy stored
in the reactants
Final energy stored
in the products
An energy profile diagram like the one above could be given to you in a question. The
following are some example tasks that you may be asked to complete:
• Label the activation energy (answer shown in purple above).
• Label OR explain the enthalpy change (answer shown in orange above).
• Describe why the amount of energy increases initially in the energy profile diagram
(answer shown in green above).
• Describe why the amount of energy decreases following the top of the peak in the energy
profile diagram (answer shown in blue above).
Note, when labelling the activation energy or enthalpy change you need to be precise
with placement of arrows otherwise you will lose marks. Using a ruler to draw a dotted
horizontal line makes this labelling easier.
Another question may be: Does the energy profile diagram represent an exothermic or
an endothermic reaction? Justify your reasoning.
For this question, you should note that as this is a 50:50 choice, you do not get a mark
for making the correct selection. The term ‘justify’ means you need to provide evidence/
reasons why the energy profile diagram is exothermic or why it is not endothermic. As
such, if this was a 2-mark question, your answer should look as follows:
Exothermic (no mark)
The energy of the products is lower than the energy of the reactants (1 mark) OR the
enthalpy change (ΔH) is negative. (1 mark)
Whereas, for endothermic reactions the energy of the products is higher than the energy of
the reactants OR the enthalpy change (ΔH) is positive. (1 mark)

Short-answer questions
11 Concerns from society about the rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions are continuing
to drive our focus on aspects of different types of fuels. Coal is one of Australia’s largest
exports; however, the mining and burning of coal is a major contributor to our greenhouse
gas emissions.
a List the two forms of greenhouse gases that are released from the plant remains
during the formation of coal. (1 mark)
b What conditions help to cause the release of these greenhouse gas emissions
from the coal beds? c Coal is an example of a fossil fuel. Explain why, by comparing this to biofuels. (1 mark)
(2 marks)
In the Latrobe Valley, east of Melbourne, an electricity generation company is
planning to replace a thermal power station fired by brown coal with a thermal
plant fired by natural gas. Natural gas offers many potential benefits because it
results in the release of less greenhouse gases.
d Using your knowledge of natural gas, explain why less greenhouse gases
are emitted. (2 marks)
e Would you say that natural gas is renewable? Explain. (1 mark)
f Is the burning of natural gas an example of an exothermic or an endothermic
reaction? Explain. (2 marks)

g One issue with the location of the natural gas plant further from Melbourne
is that more energy is lost in the transmission of electricity through power lines
than the amount of energy lost by the flow of gas in pipelines. What is one
potential solution to this problem for the electricity company? h Outline why biogas is considered an example of a renewable energy resource. (1 mark)
(2 marks)
12 Bioethanol is primarily produced by the fermentation of glucose and sucrose
by yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or bacteria, such as Escherichia coli.
a Define ‘fermentation’ and include both a word equation and a balanced
chemical equation illustrating the type of fermentation Saccharomyces
cerevisiae would carry out. (3 marks)
b Bioethanol production can also use starch from corn. However, biomass
of this sort must be pretreated prior to fermentation. Define ‘biomass’. (1 mark)
c Outline one advantage and one disadvantage with the use of bioethanol
compared with petrol. (2 marks)
13 In the presence of oxygen, plants and animals can perform aerobic cellular respiration.
Writing balanced chemical equations, explain how the processes of aerobic cellular
respiration and photosynthesis are linked. (3 marks)
14 Propane is a common fuel used in portable burners, such as those found in
camp stoves. In certain situations, there is not enough ventilation for the fuel
to burn completely. This can be quite dangerous, as it leads to the production
of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that can
be poisonous if inhaled in large enough quantities. This is one reason why camp
stoves have warnings not to be used inside a tent, as the carbon monoxide
can build up quite quickly and lead to unconsciousness and death.
a Write a balanced chemical equation for the incomplete combustion reaction of
propane occurring at 25°C and 100 kPa, assuming that carbon monoxide is
the only carbon-based product formed. (2 marks)
b Describe how you know that oxygen will be the limiting reactant in this
reaction. (1 mark)
c A standard camping stove comes with 468 g of propane gas in a canister.
If this is burned in the presence of 1050 g of oxygen gas, determine the
mass (in g) of carbon monoxide that will be produced. d Determine the mass of fuel that remains following the reaction. e Calculate the energy released in MJ. f Draw a fully labelled energy profile diagram for this reaction. (2 marks)

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can write and interpret the balanced equation for photosynthesis
CODE: 1B.2

WHAT (concept explanation):
The photosynthesis equation is 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(l) → C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(g), requiring light energy and chlorophyll. It shows the mole ratio of 6:6:1:6 for reactants and products.

WHY (importance):
This equation allows calculation of reactant requirements and product yields, and demonstrates the stoichiometric relationships in biological energy transformation.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
To produce 180 g of glucose (1 mol), plants require 264 g of carbon dioxide (6 mol) and 108 g of water (6 mol), releasing 192 g of oxygen (6 mol).

SUBTOPIC: Chemical Energy in Nature
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic examines how plants and animals produce and transform energy through photosynthesis and cellular respiration. It covers the chemical equations, conditions, and relationship between these complementary biological processes.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: These processes form the foundation of energy flow in ecosystems and are the basis for all biofuels. Understanding them connects light energy to usable chemical energy and explains how organisms meet their energy needs.

TOPIC: Carbon-Based Fuels
SUBJECT: Chemistry | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Exploration of fossil fuels and biofuels, their production, renewability, and energy transformations. Includes photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and thermochemical analysis of combustion reactions.

CARBON-BASED FUELS
Introduction
This chapter begins your exploration of energy and some of the different types of
fuel used to generate energy for society. You will compare various types of fossil
fuels and biofuels, including how they are sourced, produced and used in society,
while understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each. You will also look
at the processes by which plants and animals convert the energy contained within
light and food into usable forms of chemical energy. You will learn about reactions that
either release or absorb heat energy, as well as how to represent these diagrammatically.
Finally, you will look at calculating the quantity of energy released from the combustion
of fuels and explore the concepts of limiting and excess reagents for these types of reactions.

Australia’s first petrol-driven car
When Harley Tarrant was young, his
father owned the Clunes Gazette, the
St Kilda Chronicle and the Prahran
Chronicle. As such, Harley was
surrounded by information from overseas
publications, and from these articles he
learned about, and became obsessed
with, cars.
Later, when working on the Nullarbor
Plain as a surveyor, he determined
that steam and electric vehicles would
not be suitable to tackle the harsh
Australian outback. In 1897, he decided
to build a kerosene engine with bicycle-
maker, Howard Lewis. Due to the high

Harley Tarrant and Howard Lewis in 1901.
temperature at which kerosene vaporises,
it was not suitable as a fuel for a car engine, but it was ideal for pumping water. His engine
sold extremely well across Australia, providing him funding to continue working on a
suitable fuel and engine for an automobile.
Following this, Tarrant and Lewis set out to build their own petrol-driven car, which
used an imported Benz engine. After successfully developing a two-cylinder petrol
motor car in 1901, they refined it further with their own locally made engine. At the
time, they decided to sacrifice speed for a car that would thrive in Australian conditions.
Since then, and especially recently, the use of different fuels has continued to evolve
from fossil fuels to biofuels, and now the push to fully electric vehicles. Fossil fuels and
biofuels, with a focus on their renewability, are discussed further in this section.

EXPLAIN
What are fuels and why do we need them?
Likely, when you hear the word ‘fuel’, you think about petrol, diesel or coal used to power
planes, trains and automobiles. However, as you will see later in this chapter, food, such as
sugar, is also used as a fuel for our bodies.
Fuels are both organic and inorganic substances capable of storing chemical energy. In this
section, we will look at only organic fuels. As you will see in Section 1C, when a fuel is
burned, the stored chemical energy is released as heat (thermal) energy, which can then be
further used to power objects.
You should be familiar with the units of energy from earlier years in science. The
International System of Units (SI) unit for energy is the joule, J.
Fossil fuels
Fossil fuels are mostly hydrocarbons, with some other minor impurities, as you learned
about in Unit 1 and will learn more about in Unit 4. They are called ‘fossil’ fuels, as they
are formed through the fossilised remains and subsequent decay of plants, animals and
microorganisms, which lived millions of years ago. The hydrocarbon remains are extracted
through mining and the drilling of wells both on land and at sea. These remains still contain
some of the chemical energy that the plants, and the plants consumed by animals at the
time, originally stored from transforming light energy from the Sun when carrying out
photosynthesis. Photosynthesis as a chemical process will be covered further in Section 1B.
Fossil fuels are non-renewable, meaning their availability is limited and they are being
consumed at a rate faster than they are being produced. As these fossil fuels are formed over
millions of years, once they are depleted, they will not be replaced any time soon.
Fossil fuels can be separated into three main categories: coal, natural gas and petroleum.

Coal
Coal is a layer of sedimentary rock formed underground, containing mostly plant remains,
that are then buried by further sediments. It is formed under low oxygen conditions at
high temperatures and pressures over millions of years. Coal formations are called ‘coal
beds’ and they exist globally. The deeper the coal bed, the higher its rank, where the
ranking is based on how much it has changed over time. Deeper underground, the plant
matter experiences higher temperatures and pressures, and so more of the plant remains
are transformed into carbon, while water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane
(CH4) escape. The methane that is produced is trapped as coal seam gas. The higher the
percentage of carbon, the better the coal fuel source.

Coal is the most abundant of the fossil fuels and is the largest fuel source used for
generating electricity in the world. Coal is Australia’s largest energy resource. It is mined in
every state in Australia, with the largest black coal resources located in New South Wales
and Queensland. As Figure 1A–3 shows, black coal is buried deeper than other layers of
coal, but because of the heat efficiency it provides, it is much more economical for mining.
Approximately 70% of the coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to eastern Asian
regions. In 2019, pre-COVID, coal exploration expenditure was $229 million, which was
an increase of 32% from 2018. In comparison, the combustion of brown coal produces
approximately 85% of Australia’s electricity.

Fracking

Natural gas
Natural gas is mostly methane (CH4), with traces of other small hydrocarbons, such as
ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10). Other substances including water,
carbon dioxide, sulfur and nitrogen can also be present in the gas reservoirs.
You will recall that in the formation of coal, the increased pressure and temperature
resulted in the physical and chemical change of the sedimentary rock, releasing methane,
carbon dioxide and water.
Likewise, this pressure causes the natural gas found in rock formations to adsorb to the
surface of the coal. When drilling wells fracture coal deposits, natural gas flows to the
surface, as shown in Figure 1A–4. This process is called fracking. A fracking fluid is injected
into the well to increase the permeability of the sediment, allowing an easier flow of gas to
the surface. The fracking fluid contains sand, water and other chemicals. A chemical once
used in fracking fluid was benzene, which you will learn about in Section 8B. However, this
has been banned in Australia because it is carcinogenic, and there is a potential risk of it
escaping and contaminating water supplies. Sand is convenient as a component of this fluid
because it is often present at the site of drilling. However, water is not, and so this has to
be transported to the drilling sites, which is environmentally unfriendly and economically
costly.
One of the environmental concerns associated with fracking is that it releases methane, a
greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. It is predicted that approximately 4–8% leaks to the
atmosphere from the well head, pipelines and storage facilities.

Petroleum
In Unit 1, you learned about crude oil as being a mixture of predominantly alkanes, which
are organic hydrocarbon molecules. Like coal and natural gas, crude oil is formed from
plant and animal remains that decay over millions of years. However, crude oil is not as
widespread or as easy to access as coal and natural gas.
Crude oil is essentially petrol (petroleum). However, because the crude oil mixture contains
many hydrocarbons with varying sizes (based on their number of carbon atoms), it is not
useful to mine and use directly once drilled and brought to the surface. The crude oil
first needs to be separated into its various hydrocarbon fractions in a process called
fractional distillation.
Fractional distillation works on the fundamental basis that different-sized hydrocarbons
can be separated from each other because of their different boiling points, something you
learned in Unit 1 and will again cover in Section 10B. Countries in the Middle East are the
main sources and exporters of crude oil, including petrol, internationally. Australia, being
one of their trade partners, imports 90% of all the crude oil it uses. Australia does have a few
small crude oil reserves off the coast of northern Western Australia, South Australia and
Bass Strait; however, these are likely to be depleted by 2100.

Biofuels
While fossil fuels take millions of years to produce, and are being used up at a faster rate
than which they are being replenished, biofuels are the opposite. Biofuels are classified
as renewable because they can be produced at the same rate at which they are consumed.
As the name suggests, they are produced from living (hence, bio) matter, called biomass.
There are three types of biofuels covered in this chapter: biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel.
Figure 1A–5 shows the proportion of feedstocks in total biofuel production. As you will see

Biogas
Biogas is formed from the breakdown of organic biological waste, such as plant matter,
by anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria are those that thrive in the absence of oxygen.
The bacteria break down complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose and starch, as well as
proteins, into simpler molecules. The contents and percentage of these simpler molecules
will depend on the starting organic material that is being decomposed. Approximate
percentages are shown in Table 1A–1.

As you can see from the biogas cycle shown in Figure 1A–6, the original solar energy is
captured by crops and transformed into chemical energy by photosynthesis, which will
be explored in Section 1B. For large-scale production, the organic waste produced from
harvesting crops, food waste and animal by-products is placed in a large tank called a
digester. The digester is filled with anaerobic bacteria. Waste from this process can be used
as a good biofertiliser and the biogas produced is useful for heating and electricity in homes
and farms. This cycle further highlights the renewability and low impact of greenhouse
gas emissions for this process.

large-scale biogas plant was announced for Nowra, in NSW. According to the Australian
Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), the estimated biogas potential would place Australia
on par with Germany, a leading country in the production of biogas.

Ethanol can be manufactured by the addition reaction of ethene with steam. You will
encounter this reaction again in Section 9A.
More commonly and naturally, ethanol is produced in plants and yeast that undergo
anaerobic fermentation. Typical crops grown globally for ethanol production include corn,
maize and wheat, but Australia has a long history of fermenting native plants. The Palawa
people of Tasmania have a history of using the sap of a cider gum to make the sweet
fermented drink wayalinah, and the Noongar people in south-western Australia have
fermented the fruit of the macrozamia plant (known as by-yu or kwineen) as a method of
detoxification and to enhance its nutritional value.

The main feedstock used in Australia for producing bioethanol is wheat. Facilities are
currently located in both New South Wales and Queensland, with plans for a large-scale
facility to operate in regional Victoria in the future.
In wheat and other first-generation feedstocks, biological catalysts called enzymes speed
up the breakdown of cellulose and starch to sucrose. Yeast is then added to this solution.
The yeast contains another enzyme called invertase, which helps convert the sucrose into
glucose. The glucose then binds with another enzyme in the yeast called zymase, which
assists the final step of fermentation into ethanol (bioethanol) and carbon dioxide according
to the following equation.
glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide
C6H12O6(aq) → 2CH3CH2OH(aq) + 2CO2(g)
Notice that the ethanol produced from fermentation is in an aqueous (aq) state. This
means that it is not pure and is hydrated by water molecules. These water molecules are
removed by distillation, which will be covered in more detail in Section 10B.

If you’ve got your learner permit or probationary licence and have driven to fill the car up
at the petrol station, you will have noticed the fuel pump labelled ‘E10’. It is called E10 as
it contains a blend of 90% petrol and 10% ethanol. The addition of ethanol to petrol has
several advantages, including:
• the use of petrol derived from crude oil is reduced
• the fuel is oxygenated so that it burns more completely
• the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is reduced
• the source of the bioethanol makes it a more sustainable transport fuel.
Biodiesel
Biodiesel is a mixture of organic compounds produced from vegetable oils, cooking oils
and animal fats. Because it is produced from plant and/or animal products, it is renewable
and often called ‘green diesel’. A transesterification reaction between plant and/or animal
triglycerides (fats, oils) and alcohol, typically methanol (CH3OH), results in a mixture
of methyl esters, or biodiesel. You will learn more about transesterification reactions in
Section 9B; however, an example reaction is shown in Figure 1A–8 below. Note that this
reaction also requires the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
acting as a catalyst. Biodiesel production in this way requires less energy and has less
emissions than producing bioethanol.

The other product in the transesterification reaction, glycerol, is commonly used in the
manufacture of pharmaceuticals. You will learn more about medicinal chemistry in Chapter 12.
If you look back at Figure 1A–5 on page 10, you will see that a large number of the
feedstocks used in biofuel production are vegetable oils, used for biodiesels.
There are currently three biodiesel plants operating in Australia. However, after peaking in
the mid-2010s, they now operate at less than 40% capacity. With only around 0.2% blend
rate with standard diesel, it is a fuel with very little focus in Australia. Globally, biodiesel
can be used in most existing diesel engines without them needing further modifications.
Like bioethanol, these blends are also labelled at the pump, typically as B5 or B20,
indicating a 5% or 20% blend, respectively, of biodiesel with standard diesel.

While biofuels might seem like a better alternative to fossil fuels, their increasing use in
the immediate future raises a number of other important implications that need to be
considered and managed, including:
• how much land degradation and forest destruction occurs to grow crops
• the percentage of crops grown for fuel versus that grown for food to meet the needs of
increasing population sizes.
Research is underway to look at the potential for either algae or agave crops to be used as a
feedstock for biodiesel production. The latter thrives in dry, arid desert environments with
little water and produces a high oil yield. Therefore, land required for growing food would
not be compromised.

QUESTIONS
Comparison-based questions
In this section, you were presented with six different types of fuels. You learned
about how and where each was sourced from, the chemical processes used in their
production and their respective advantages and disadvantages. As such, it is predictable
that assessment questions will require you to compare various aspects of different
combinations of these fuels. In comparison or contrast questions, you are required to
explain both the similarities and differences of each item in the question. Let’s look at an
example question, which has been adapted from the 2021 VCAA Exam and solution.
Question
Digesters use bacteria to convert organic waste into biogas. Both biogas and coal seam
gas have the same hydrocarbon as their main component. Referring specifically to this
hydrocarbon, compare biogas and coal seam gas.
VCAA 2021
Answer
Similarities:
Both are types of fuels that contain mainly methane, CH4.
Differences:
• Coal seam gas is non-renewable as it originally comes from the increased
temperature and pressure experienced by sedimentary rock deeper below Earth’s
surface and is not produced at a rate equal to or faster than it is consumed.
• On the other hand, biogas is renewable, as it is produced from the breakdown of plant
matter, in particular cellulose and starch, by bacteria under anaerobic conditions.
Notice that in this answer, the comparison word ‘whereas’ was used to differentiate
between the difference of the two fuels.
This was just one example for two fuels covered in this chapter, but other examples
may require you to compare two different types of fossil fuels or two different types of
biofuels, the advantages and/or disadvantages of different fuels or their renewability.
Developing a clear set of notes with what makes each distinct from the other will be
important for this section.

The carbon economy
Have you heard of the carbon economy? Perhaps you’re more familiar with the term
‘carbon footprint’. Both of these relate to carbon dioxide emissions. As you learned in
Unit 2, carbon dioxide emissions (a type of greenhouse gas) are primarily responsible
for global warming and climate change. Carbon dioxide is released naturally through
processes like cellular respiration, which you will learn more about in this chapter,
and fermentation. However, other human activities, such as deforestation and the
burning of fossil fuels, which you will learn more about in Section 1C, have been the
main producers of the gas. For decades, efforts have been made to monitor and lower
these emissions. Governments and industries are continually improving the efficiency
of photosynthesis, which is the way carbon dioxide is naturally removed from the
atmosphere. The benefits of this improvement will be twofold. The world’s population
is growing rapidly and greater quantities of food will be needed to support future
generations. Not only will there be less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but it is
thought that increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis will mean more nutrient-rich
crops and increased crop yields. Governments and industries also want to increase
the production of biomass, a sustainable and renewable energy resource, in the hope
that this will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and again reduce the volume of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.

Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is an anabolic chemical reaction in which the Sun’s light energy is used to
convert the inorganic compounds carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into the organic
compound glucose (C6H12O6). Glucose can then be used as a source of energy by the cells
of living organisms, enabling growth and reproduction.
Photosynthesis consists of a series of steps (a biochemical pathway), with each step
controlled by a different enzyme. The overall process of photosynthesis can be written as
both a word equation and a balanced chemical equation:
carbon dioxide + water oxygen + glucose

The oxygen released is

is a very important reactant
for cellular respiration in both
plants and animals. The glucose
produced from photosynthesis
in plants is the key reactant
required for cellular respiration
in living organisms, as you
will see later in this chapter.
As you learned in Section 1A,
glucose is also the key input for
fermentation in the production
of bioethanol from plants
and yeast.
Photosynthesis is an example
of an endothermic reaction,
which you will learn about in

2 a Write the word equation for photosynthesis.
b Write the simplified balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis.
Cellular respiration
Like photosynthesis, cellular respiration occurs as a series of steps in a biochemical
pathway, with each step controlled by a different enzyme. You do not need to be familiar
with any of these steps in this chemistry course. The purpose of cellular respiration is the
catabolic breakdown of glucose, which releases the chemical energy in a form more usable
for cells, as a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
There are two types of cellular respiration. The first occurs in the absence of oxygen
(anaerobic) and is commonly referred to as fermentation. You learned about this in
Section 1A. This occurs in certain plants and yeast, resulting in the production of ethanol
(bioethanol) and carbon dioxide, according to the following equation:
glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide
C6H12O6(aq) → 2CH3CH2OH(aq) + 2CO2(g)
In animals, a slightly different form of anaerobic cellular respiration takes place. It is often
called lactic acid fermentation and results in the production of lactic acid (lactate ions),
which is associated with muscle cramping. This chemical reaction is represented according
to the following equation:

The second form of cellular respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen (aerobic). This
occurs in many plant and animal cells with some steps occurring inside the mitochondria,
the energy powerhouse of the cell. Aerobic cellular respiration results in a much greater
yield of energy per mole of glucose than that yielded by anaerobic cellular respiration.

You will recall from Unit 2, and this will again be covered in Section 3A, that oxidation
means a loss of electrons. If you look at the oxidation numbers, in red, shown above the
balanced chemical equation, you will see that the carbon changes from a ‘0’ to a ‘+4’
oxidation number. This means it is losing electrons. Conversely, the oxygen gas reactant is
being reduced, as it changes oxidation number from ‘0’ to ‘+2’.
As glucose can be broken down to release the energy required for all metabolic reactions
occurring in our bodies’ cells, it is a type of fuel. Like the other fuels you learned about in
Section 1A, it undergoes a combustion reaction that releases energy, which means it is an
exothermic reaction. Exothermic combustion reactions will be discussed in more detail in
Section 1C.
As in photosynthesis, there are many factors which affect the rate of cellular respiration
reactions, such as temperature, glucose availability, oxygen concentration and enzyme
(catalyst) concentration. Factors affecting the frequency and success of collisions between
reactants, and the subsequent rate of chemical reactions, are explored further in Section 5B.

Figure 1B–4 The complementary nature of the photosynthesis and cellular respiration reactions
means that carbon, hydrogen and oxygen cycle through organisms and their environments continually.
Referring to Figure 1B–4, note the following key points.
• Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, an organelle found only in the cells of green
plants and algae.
• The products of photosynthesis (oxygen and glucose) are used as reactants in the
process of aerobic cellular respiration.
• Aerobic cellular respiration occurs mostly in mitochondria, organelles found in
animal, plant and fungal cells, and protists.
• Aerobic cellular respiration uses the products of photosynthesis to produce ATP,
an energy storage molecule, which can then release energy to meet the cell’s
requirements.
• In plants, the products of aerobic cellular respiration (water and carbon dioxide) can
then be used as reactants in the process of photosynthesis.
• Although photosynthesis appears to be the reverse of cellular respiration, the
processes are different and use different enzymes. (You will learn in general about
enzymes in Section 12B.)
Using the Study Design to guide your preparation
The most important way of determining the detail you need to know is by looking at
the Study Design and completing many practice questions. Keep focused on the terms
used in the Study Design dot points and, when making notes, always use the dot points,
or part of the dot points, as your headings. The Study Design was written specifically to
cover what you need to know, and the success criteria have been written to guide you
through the necessary material.
For example, the Study Design requires you to know that photosynthesis is a source of
both glucose and oxygen, which are required for respiration in living things, and that it is
in these living things where the glucose is oxidised as the primary energy source.

produced by an aquatic green plant and the light intensity it was exposed to. They set
up two beakers with similarly sized sections of aquatic plant and placed one in the shade
and one next to a light source. The students recorded the number of bubbles given off by
each plant in two minutes. They then moved the plant near the light source, 10 cm away,
and repeated their recordings. They continued moving the plant back in 10 cm intervals
until the plant was 50 cm away from the light source.

both involve chemical reactions that release heat into the environment! In this section,
you are going to gain an understanding of two different types of reactions and how they
either release or absorb heat from the environment. You will also investigate a specific
type of exothermic reaction, called combustion reactions, as a way of obtaining energy
from fuels. Lastly, you will learn how to draw energy profile diagrams to represent the
reactions occurring during these processes.

1C EXOTHERMIC AND ENDOTHERMIC REACTIONS

EXPLAIN
Exothermic and endothermic reactions
For a chemical reaction to occur, the bonds within the reactants must first be broken.
This requires energy and the exact quantity of energy is specific for each reaction. Every
reaction has a minimum amount of energy that is needed for the reaction to occur –
this is known as the activation energy and is represented by the symbol E
. As a reaction
a
proceeds, new bonds must be formed to generate the products. Unlike breaking bonds,
this process releases energy. This can be summarised by the following statements:
Breaking bonds: requires energy from the environment
Forming bonds: releases energy to the environment
The chemical energy of a substance is called its enthalpy or heat content and has the
symbol H. The overall change in energy from reactants to products is known as the
enthalpy change (ΔH). The enthalpy change indicates whether more energy was required
to break the reactant bonds than was released forming the product bonds or vice versa. It
can be represented by the equation:
Δ H(reaction) = Σ H(reactant bonds broken) – Σ H(product bonds formed)
From this equation, we can see that there are two possible outcomes.
1 The energy required to break the bonds of the reactants is greater than the energy
released from forming the bonds in the products. In this instance, the ΔH will be
positive, and the reaction is referred to as an endothermic reaction.
2 The energy required to break the bonds of the reactants is less than the energy released
from forming the bonds in the products. In this instance, the ΔH will be negative, and
the reaction is referred to as an exothermic reaction.
Exothermic and endothermic reactions can be illustrated using energy profile diagrams
(Figure 1C–1).

Calculating the value for the enthalpy change of a reaction can be important in
understanding the energy content of fuels and foods. This will be covered in more depth
in Section 2B.
It is important to note that in an exothermic reaction, where the ΔH is negative, the
products are at a lower energy level than the reactants. This means that in an exothermic
reaction the products are more stable than the reactants.
It is the opposite when considering an endothermic reaction, where the ΔH is positive.
In these reactions, the reactants, which are at a lower energy level than the products, are
more stable.
Key points and differences between exothermic and endothermic reactions are summarised
in Table 1C–2.

Combustion of fuels
Earlier in this chapter, we discussed fuels as sources of energy. To obtain energy from these
types of fuels, they must undergo combustion reactions. Combustion reactions involve
reacting an organic fuel in the presence of oxygen gas, and produce carbon dioxide, water
and heat energy. As heat energy is released as part of these reactions, all combustion
reactions are exothermic.
Knowledge of combustion reactions means they can be employed in society’s favour. This
can allow for more efficient consumption of petrol in a car or to maximise the energy
produced in thermal power plants. With the increasing severity of bushfires in Australia,
there has been a growing resurgence of interest in examining the techniques of First
Nations cultural (or cool) burning, the oldest known farming practice in the world. First
Nations rangers and traditional owners in the Kimberley region in northern Western
Australia perform targeted burnings during the early dry season (March to July) to
minimise the most dangerous season for bushfires (August to November).
Combustion reactions can be represented by thermochemical equations, which not only
show the reactants and products of the reaction, but also the energy released.
Let’s start by writing the balanced equation for the complete combustion of methane:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
The first thing that you might notice in the above equation is that water is present in
the gaseous state (that is, as water vapour), rather than as a liquid. This is because all
combustion reactions occur at high temperatures that are above the boiling point of water.
This equation, however, is not a thermochemical equation. For this, we need to add in the
enthalpy change data for the combustion of methane. For many common fuels, the heat of
combustion has been determined experimentally, and the values are provided in the VCAA
Data Book. Using this, we see that the heat of combustion for methane is given as 55.6 kJ g–1
or 890 kJ mol–1. This can then be added to our balanced equation to give us a complete
thermochemical equation as follows:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) ΔH = –890 kJ mol–1

NOTE
You will notice that in the thermochemical equation, the state for the water produced is now
liquid (l). This is because all reactants and products must be in their standard states at SLC
(standard laboratory conditions; 25ºC, 100 kPa).
With this information, it is possible to calculate the quantity of heat released from
the combustion of methane in almost any given situation at 25ºC and 100 kPa. This
thermochemical equation tells us that the combustion of one mole of methane releases
890 kJ of energy. If two moles of methane underwent combustion, 1780 kJ of energy (that is,
2 × 890) would be released. You will learn more about how to perform these calculations
in Section 2A. In these instances, we are assuming that the fuel continues to react until
it is all gone. This is true if the reaction takes place with an abundance of oxygen gas;
however, this isn’t always the case. If the oxygen is depleted before the fuel, the reaction
is known as incomplete combustion. Due to the lack of oxygen present, different carbon-
containing products are formed from this reaction: solid carbon, carbon monoxide gas

and carbon dioxide gas. Shown below is one possible equation for the incomplete
combustion of methane, where carbon monoxide, rather than carbon dioxide, is the only
carbon-containing product generated:
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(l)
If incomplete combustion occurs, the energy released will be less than if complete
combustion occurs. To determine whether complete or incomplete combustion will occur in
certain circumstances, we need to understand the concept of limiting and excess reagents.
NOTE
In some cases of incomplete combustion, solid carbon, C(s), is also produced as a product. This
can be observed as soot.
Limiting and excess reagents
In Unit 2, you learned about a variety of different applications where you may be required

information about the relative amounts of each compound needed for the reaction to occur.
In a way, this is similar to how a recipe provides instructions on the different quantities of
ingredients required to make a meal or bake a cake.
Let’s look at part of a hypothetical recipe for a banana cake. As well as other ingredients, the
recipe says that to make one cake we need:
• 3 bananas
• 2 eggs
• 1 cup of milk.
Pantry 1 Pantry 2 Pantry 3
Figure 1C–2 Using cake ingredients to model
mole ratios
We can essentially express this in the same way that we would a
balanced chemical reaction:
3 bananas + 2 eggs + 1 cup of milk → 1 banana cake
This shows us that the numbers (or coefficients) in front of each
ingredient provide the ratio required to make our product, the
banana cake. Now let’s look at the ingredients contained within
three potential pantries (Figure 1C–2).
Referring to our original recipe equation, we need: 3 bananas,
2 eggs and 1 cup of milk.
For each pantry, our equation looks like this:
Pantry 1: 3 bananas + 2 eggs + 1 cup of milk → ? banana cakes
Pantry 2: 3 bananas + 4 eggs + 2 cups of milk → ? banana cakes
Pantry 3: 6 bananas + 3 eggs + 2 cups of milk → ? banana cakes
In each instance, you can see that we need to work out the total
number of banana cakes that we can make from the ingredients
that we have.
In pantry 1, we have the exact number of each ingredient required by the original recipe to
make a single banana cake.

In pantry 2, we can see that we have double the number of eggs and double the number
of cups of milk required to make a single banana cake. However, if we wanted to make
two banana cakes, we would also need 6 bananas. We only have 3 bananas in this pantry,
which is only enough to make 1 banana cake. In this instance, the bananas are our limiting
ingredient (or reagent). In contrast, the eggs and milk will both be present in excess.
In pantry 3, we can see that we have double the number of bananas and double the
number of cups of milk required to make a single banana cake. However, if we wanted to
make 2 banana cakes, we would also need 4 eggs. While we have more eggs than we need
to make a single cake (2 eggs), we still have less than we need to make 2 cakes (4 eggs).
This means that in this pantry, the eggs are our limiting ingredient and the bananas and
milk will both be present in excess.
From this example, it should be clear that we can only make as many cakes as our limiting
ingredient allows. By applying our ingredient ratios to pantry 3 and only focusing on the
limiting ingredient, we can calculate the following:
2 eggs: 1 cake
3 eggs: 1.5 cakes
While this example may have just made you crave banana cake, it also illustrates perfectly
the concept of limiting and excess reagents and how they can be used to calculate the
theoretical amount of product that can be generated from a chemical reaction.
Let’s now look at a specific worked example using the combustion of methane.

n(CH4) : n(O2) = 1 : 2
So, 2 mol of CH4 would react with
4 mol of O2.
Step 4 Based on the moles present of one
reactant, work out how much would
be required of the other, based on the
mole ratio in the equation.
4 mol of O2 required
6 mol of O2 present
O2 present > O2 required
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the second
reagent is more or less than what is
required from Step 3.
There is more oxygen present than
required.

30 CHAPTER 1 CARBON-BASED FUELS
As you can see in Worked example 1C–1, the oxygen is in excess and so this will lead to
complete combustion. You can also see from this example that we need to know the moles
of each reactant to determine the limiting and excess reagents. However, if you are given a
mass, as in the following example, you need to complete an extra step.

WORKED
EXAMPLE 1C–2
Worked example 1C–2: Determining the limiting reagent in moles
Methane (CH4) reacts in the presence of oxygen (O2) to produce carbon monoxide (CO)
and water (H2O). Initially, 8.0 g of methane and 16.0 g of oxygen are present. Determine
the limiting reagent in this reaction.
Solution
Step 1 Logic Write a balanced equation for
the reaction.
Process
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
Step 2 Write the relevant information
provided in the question under
the equation.
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
m = 8.0 g m = 16.0 g
Step 3 Calculate the amount, in mol,
of each reactant.
n(CH4) = m
M
n(CH4) = 8.0 g
16.0 g mol–1
n(CH4) = 0.50 mol
n(O2) = m
M
n(O2) = 16.0 g
32.0 g mol–1
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
Step 4 Based on the moles present
of one reactant, work out how
much would be required of the
other, based on the mole ratio
in the equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 2 : 3
0.50 mol of O2 would react with 0.33 mol
of CH4.
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the
second reagent is more or less
than what is required from
Step 3.
0.33 mol of CH4 required
0.50 mol of CH4 present
CH4 present > CH4 required
Step 6 State the limiting reagent. As there is more CH4 present than required,
CH4 is the excess reagent, making O2 the
limiting reagent.
Lastly, once we have determined the limiting reagent, we can also use this information
to calculate the amount or mass of a product, or the quantity of heat in the case of
combustion, that is generated from the reaction. This type of question is illustrated in
Worked example 1C–3.

Worked example 1C–3: Determining the mass of the product or the quantity
of heat
VIDEO
WORKED
EXAMPLE 1C–3
Using the reaction from Worked example 1C–2, determine the mass of carbon
monoxide that would be produced. We will start from the beginning and add extra steps
at the end to show how this question could be done in its entirety.
Solution
Logic Write a balanced equation for
the reaction.
Process
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
Step 1 Step 2 Write the relevant information
provided in the question under
the equation.
2CH4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO(g) + 4H2O(g)
m = 8.0 g m = 16.0 g
Step 3 Calculate the amount, in mol,
of each reactant.
n(CH4) = m
M
n(CH4) = 8.0 g
16.0 g mol–1
n(CH4) = 0.50 mol
n(O2) = m
M
n(O2) = 16.0 g
32.0 g mol–1
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
Step 4 Based on the moles present
of one reactant, work out how
much would be required of the
other, based on the mole ratio
in the equation.
n(CH4) : n(O2) = 2 : 3
0.50 mol of O2 would react with 0.33 mol
of CH4.
Step 5 Determine if the amount of the
second reagent is more or less
than what is required from
Step 3.
0.33 mol of CH4 required
0.50 mol of CH4 present
CH4 present > CH4 required
Step 6 State the limiting reagent. Step 7 Use the number of moles of the
limiting reagent and the mole
ratio to calculate the number of
moles of the desired product.
As there is more CH4 present than required,
CH4 is the excess reagent, making O2 the
limiting reagent.
n(O2) : n(CO) = 3 : 2
n(O2) = 0.50 mol
n(C0 produced) = 2
× 0.50 = 0.33 mol
3
Step 8 Use n =
m
to calculate the
M
mass in grams produced.
n(CO) = m
M
m(CO) = n × M
m(CO) = 0.33 mol × 28.0 g mol–1
m(CO produced) = 9.3 g
Linking this back to combustion reactions, we can now understand the main difference
between complete and incomplete combustion and summarise it as follows:
• complete combustion: the fuel is the limiting reagent, oxygen is the excess reagent
• incomplete combustion: the fuel is the excess reagent, oxygen is the limiting reagent.

1C SKILLS
Representing and analysing energy profile diagrams
Being able to draw fully labelled energy profile diagrams is an important skill for
assessments. However, you also need to be able to explain what each part of the energy
profile diagram represents, as well as connect this to key chemistry terms for this topic.
Consider the example shown below.
Energy from the environment
required to break bonds in
the reactant(s)
Energy released to the
environment in the forming
of bonds in the product(s)
Activation energy (Ea)
*The double-headed arrow must extend
from the base energy of the reactants to the
peak of the graph. Therefore, it is good to
include a dotted line using a ruler.*
Energy
Reactants
Products
Enthalpy change, ( H ), representing
the difference in energy between the
reactants and the products
Progress of reaction
Initial energy stored
in the reactants
Final energy stored
in the products
An energy profile diagram like the one above could be given to you in a question. The
following are some example tasks that you may be asked to complete:
• Label the activation energy (answer shown in purple above).
• Label OR explain the enthalpy change (answer shown in orange above).
• Describe why the amount of energy increases initially in the energy profile diagram
(answer shown in green above).
• Describe why the amount of energy decreases following the top of the peak in the energy
profile diagram (answer shown in blue above).
Note, when labelling the activation energy or enthalpy change you need to be precise
with placement of arrows otherwise you will lose marks. Using a ruler to draw a dotted
horizontal line makes this labelling easier.
Another question may be: Does the energy profile diagram represent an exothermic or
an endothermic reaction? Justify your reasoning.
For this question, you should note that as this is a 50:50 choice, you do not get a mark
for making the correct selection. The term ‘justify’ means you need to provide evidence/
reasons why the energy profile diagram is exothermic or why it is not endothermic. As
such, if this was a 2-mark question, your answer should look as follows:
Exothermic (no mark)
The energy of the products is lower than the energy of the reactants (1 mark) OR the
enthalpy change (ΔH) is negative. (1 mark)
Whereas, for endothermic reactions the energy of the products is higher than the energy of
the reactants OR the enthalpy change (ΔH) is positive. (1 mark)

14 Propane is a common fuel used in portable burners, such as those found in
camp stoves. In certain situations, there is not enough ventilation for the fuel
to burn completely. This can be quite dangerous, as it leads to the production
of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that can
be poisonous if inhaled in large enough quantities. This is one reason why camp
stoves have warnings not to be used inside a tent, as the carbon monoxide
can build up quite quickly and lead to unconsciousness and death.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
