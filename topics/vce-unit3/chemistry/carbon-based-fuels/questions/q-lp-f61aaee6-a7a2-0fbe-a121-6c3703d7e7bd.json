      "correct": "Natural gas produces fewer CO2 emissions per unit energy but fracking can contaminate groundwater",
      "correctExplanation": "Natural gas burns more cleanly than coal per unit energy, but hydraulic fracturing raises concerns about groundwater contamination and methane leaks.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Natural gas produces zero emissions while coal produces very high levels always", "explanation": "Natural gas does produce CO2 when burned; it simply produces less per unit energy than coal." },
        { "answer": "Coal extraction has no environmental impact while fracking causes major damage", "explanation": "Coal mining also has significant environmental impacts including habitat destruction and water pollution." },
        { "answer": "Both fuels have identical environmental impacts per unit of energy produced", "explanation": "Natural gas produces roughly half the CO2 per unit energy compared to coal; their impacts differ significantly." }

      "question": "Compare the suitability of coal and petroleum as transport fuels. Which analysis is most accurate?",
      "correct": "Petroleum is more suitable because its liquid fractions are easily used in vehicle engines",
      "correctExplanation": "Petroleum can be refined into petrol and diesel, which are liquid fuels suited to internal combustion engines, while solid coal cannot be directly used in vehicles.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Coal is more suitable because solid fuels burn more efficiently in engines", "explanation": "Solid fuels cannot be used in conventional vehicle engines; liquid fuels from petroleum are required." },
        { "answer": "Both are equally suitable since they contain the same hydrocarbon types", "explanation": "Physical state matters greatly for transport fuels; liquid petroleum fractions are far more practical than solid coal." },
        { "answer": "Neither is suitable because fossil fuels cannot power any vehicle engines", "explanation": "Petroleum-derived fuels have powered vehicles for over a century; they are highly suitable for transport." }

      "question": "Analyse why Australia exports black coal rather than brown coal to international markets.",
      "correct": "Black coal has higher energy density, making it more economical to transport long distances",
      "correctExplanation": "Black coal's higher energy content per kilogram justifies the cost of shipping, while brown coal's low energy density and high moisture make export uneconomical.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Brown coal is illegal to export under Australian environmental regulations", "explanation": "There is no law banning brown coal export; it is simply uneconomical due to low energy density and high moisture." },
        { "answer": "Black coal is renewable while brown coal is non-renewable and finite today", "explanation": "Both types of coal are non-renewable fossil fuels; the export difference is about energy density and economics." },
        { "answer": "Brown coal does not exist in sufficient quantities for any export purpose", "explanation": "Victoria has enormous brown coal reserves; the issue is economic viability of export, not quantity." }

      "correct": "It produces less CO2 per unit energy than coal or oil but still contributes to climate change",
      "correctExplanation": "Natural gas produces roughly half the CO2 of coal per unit energy, but it is still a fossil fuel that adds ancient carbon to the atmosphere.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is entirely correct because natural gas combustion produces zero emissions", "explanation": "Natural gas combustion does produce CO2 and water; it is cleaner than coal but not emission-free." },
        { "answer": "The claim is entirely wrong because natural gas produces more CO2 than any coal", "explanation": "Natural gas produces less CO2 per unit energy than coal; the claim has merit but requires qualification." },
        { "answer": "The claim is irrelevant because all fossil fuels have identical environmental impacts", "explanation": "Different fossil fuels have different emission profiles; natural gas genuinely produces less CO2 per unit energy." }

      "type": "mc",
      "question": "A government must decide which fossil fuel to phase out first. Which analysis best supports prioritising the phase-out of brown coal?",
      "correct": "Brown coal produces the most CO2 per unit energy due to low carbon content and high moisture",
      "correctExplanation": "Brown coal's high moisture content and low energy density mean more must be burned per unit of electricity, producing the highest CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Brown coal should be kept because it is the only renewable type of fossil fuel", "explanation": "No type of coal is renewable; brown coal's high emissions per unit energy make it the strongest candidate for phase-out." },
        { "answer": "Natural gas should be phased out first because it is the most polluting fuel", "explanation": "Natural gas is the least CO2-intensive fossil fuel per unit energy; brown coal is the most intensive." },
        { "answer": "All fossil fuels produce identical emissions so the order of phase-out is irrelevant", "explanation": "Emission intensities differ significantly; brown coal produces the most CO2 per unit energy generated." }

      "correctExplanation": "Transitioning from coal to gas requires investment in new drilling infrastructure, pipelines, and retraining of the workforce.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "No economic changes would occur because both fuels use identical extraction methods", "explanation": "Coal mining and gas drilling use completely different technologies and infrastructure." },

      "correctExplanation": "Petrol and diesel are energy-dense liquids that are easy to store in tanks, while compressed natural gas requires heavy, pressurised containers.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Natural gas cannot be used as a fuel in any type of motor vehicle engine", "explanation": "Natural gas vehicles exist; the dominance of petroleum relates to practical storage and energy density advantages." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It is the only known method for generating electricity from any fossil fuel source", "explanation": "Electricity can be generated by burning coal or gas directly; distillation specifically separates petroleum fractions." },
        { "answer": "It creates entirely new chemical elements that do not exist in crude oil naturally", "explanation": "Distillation is a physical separation; it does not create new elements, only separates existing compounds." },
