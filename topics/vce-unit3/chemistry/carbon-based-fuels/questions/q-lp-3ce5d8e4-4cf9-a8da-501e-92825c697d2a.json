      "correct": "The claim is oversimplified; biofuel production can cause deforestation and land-use change",
      "correctExplanation": "While biofuels are renewable, large-scale production may require clearing forests for cropland, releasing stored carbon and reducing biodiversity.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct; biofuels produce zero carbon dioxide upon combustion in engines", "explanation": "Biofuels do produce CO2 when burned; the argument for lower net emissions relies on the carbon cycle, not zero emissions." },
        { "answer": "The claim is correct; biofuels require absolutely no energy input for their production", "explanation": "Biofuel production requires significant energy for farming, processing, and transport, so it is not energy-free." },
        { "answer": "The claim is wrong; biofuels are actually classified as non-renewable fossil fuel types", "explanation": "Biofuels are renewable by definition; the claim's weakness is about environmental trade-offs, not classification." }

      "question": "Which conclusion is best supported by the fact that biofuel feedstock absorbs CO2 during growth?",
      "correct": "Biofuels can be approximately carbon-neutral over their full life cycle",
      "correctExplanation": "The CO2 released during combustion is offset by the CO2 absorbed during feedstock growth, making the net cycle approximately carbon-neutral.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Biofuels produce no CO2 at any stage of their production or use in engines", "explanation": "Biofuels do release CO2 during combustion; carbon neutrality refers to balance, not absence of emissions." },
        { "answer": "Biofuels absorb more CO2 than all fossil fuels combined release each year", "explanation": "Biofuel crops absorb CO2 proportional to their growth, not enough to offset all global fossil fuel emissions." },
        { "answer": "Burning biofuels permanently removes CO2 from the atmosphere into deep stores", "explanation": "Combustion releases CO2; it is the regrowth of feedstock that reabsorbs CO2, creating a cycle, not removal." }

      "correct": "Fossil fuels add ancient carbon to the atmosphere; biofuels recycle recent carbon",
      "correctExplanation": "Fossil fuels release carbon sequestered millions of years ago, increasing atmospheric CO2, while biofuels cycle carbon absorbed recently by growing plants.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both fossil fuels and biofuels introduce entirely new carbon into the cycle", "explanation": "Neither creates new carbon atoms; fossil fuels release ancient stored carbon, while biofuels recycle recent carbon." },

      "question": "A student argues that because biofuels burn like fossil fuels, they should be classified identically. Which critique is strongest?",
      "correct": "Classification depends on resource origin and replacement rate, not combustion",
      "correctExplanation": "The renewable versus non-renewable distinction is based on how quickly a resource can be replenished, not on how it releases energy.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The argument is valid; combustion chemistry determines classification entirely", "explanation": "Combustion chemistry is similar for many fuels but does not determine whether a resource is renewable or non-renewable." },

      "question": "Evaluate the sustainability of a nation relying entirely on fossil fuels for energy over the next century.",
      "correct": "It is unsustainable because fossil fuel reserves are finite and will be exhausted",
      "correctExplanation": "Fossil fuels are non-renewable and will run out with continued extraction, making sole reliance unsustainable long-term.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It is sustainable because fossil fuels regenerate through rapid geological cycling", "explanation": "Geological processes take millions of years; fossil fuels cannot regenerate within a century to sustain supply." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Coal is more renewable because it has larger reserves in the ground today", "explanation": "Reserve size does not determine renewability; coal is non-renewable regardless of how much currently exists." },

      "correct": "Energy used in farming, processing, and transport adds extra CO2 emissions",
      "correctExplanation": "While biofuel combustion CO2 is offset by feedstock growth, additional emissions from machinery, fertilisers, and transport mean the full life cycle is not truly carbon-neutral.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Biofuel crops never absorb any CO2 from the atmosphere during their growth", "explanation": "Plants do absorb CO2 via photosynthesis during growth; the issue is that other production stages add emissions." },

        { "answer": "Biofuels are chemically identical to fossil fuels with the same carbon impact", "explanation": "Biofuels and fossil fuels differ in composition and carbon cycle participation, so their footprints differ." }
