      "question": "Methane has delta-H of -55.6 kJ per g and ethanol has delta-H of -29.7 kJ per g. Evaluate which is the better fuel by mass.",
      "correct": "Methane is a better fuel by mass because it releases more energy per gram",
      "correctExplanation": "55.6 kJ per gram is greater than 29.7 kJ per gram, so methane releases more energy per unit mass.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Ethanol is a better fuel by mass because it releases more energy per gram", "explanation": "29.7 kJ per gram is less than 55.6 kJ per gram, so ethanol releases less per gram." },
        { "answer": "Both fuels are equal by mass because both undergo combustion reactions", "explanation": "Different fuels have different delta-H per gram values and release different amounts." },
        { "answer": "Comparison by mass is not valid because fuels have different molar masses", "explanation": "kJ per gram specifically enables comparison regardless of different molar masses." }

      "question": "A student argues that a fuel with a larger molar mass always releases more energy per gram. Evaluate this claim.",
      "correct": "Incorrect; energy per gram depends on both delta-H per mol and molar mass together",
      "correctExplanation": "Energy per gram equals delta-H per mol divided by molar mass; both factors determine the result.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Correct; larger molecules always contain more energy in their chemical bonds", "explanation": "While larger molecules may have more bonds, the per-gram value also depends on molar mass." },
        { "answer": "Correct; molar mass is the only factor that determines energy released per gram", "explanation": "Delta-H per mol also varies; both delta-H and molar mass determine per-gram energy." },

      "question": "Analyse why hydrogen with delta-H of -286 kJ per mol and molar mass of 2.0 g per mol has a very high energy density per gram.",
      "correct": "Its very low molar mass means the per-mole energy is spread over very few grams",
      "correctExplanation": "Dividing -286 by 2.0 gives -143 kJ per gram, a high value because of the very low molar mass.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Its high molar mass concentrates energy into a very dense molecular structure", "explanation": "Hydrogen has the lowest molar mass of any fuel, not a high molar mass." },
        { "answer": "Its strong triple bonds store exceptionally large amounts of chemical energy", "explanation": "Hydrogen has a single bond, not triple bonds; the low molar mass drives per-gram value." },
        { "answer": "Its large molecular size allows it to store more energy per unit of volume", "explanation": "Hydrogen is the smallest molecule; the high per-gram value is due to low molar mass." }

      "question": "Compare reporting delta-H in kJ per mol versus kJ per gram. Which is more useful for comparing the cost-effectiveness of fuels sold by mass?",
      "correct": "kJ per gram is more useful because fuels are typically purchased and measured by mass",
      "correctExplanation": "Since fuels are sold by mass, kJ per gram directly shows energy obtained per dollar spent on mass.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "kJ per mol is more useful because it accounts for the molecular structure well", "explanation": "Molecular structure matters, but cost-effectiveness by mass requires per-gram comparison." },
        { "answer": "Both units give identical rankings so the choice of unit does not matter", "explanation": "Rankings can differ because fuels have different molar masses, changing relative values." },

      "question": "Evaluate whether a negative delta-H value alone is sufficient to determine if a reaction will occur spontaneously.",

      "correctExplanation": "A negative delta-H favours spontaneity but entropy and activation energy also play important roles.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Yes; any reaction with a negative delta-H will always occur spontaneously", "explanation": "Many exothermic reactions require activation energy and may not proceed spontaneously." },
        { "answer": "Yes; the sign of delta-H is the sole determinant of reaction spontaneity", "explanation": "Gibbs free energy, which includes entropy, determines spontaneity, not delta-H alone." },

      "correct": "Propane releases slightly more energy per gram than octane when combusted",
      "correctExplanation": "50.3 kJ per gram exceeds 47.9 kJ per gram, so propane has slightly higher energy density by mass.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Octane releases slightly more energy per gram than propane when combusted", "explanation": "47.9 is less than 50.3, so octane releases less energy per gram than propane." },
        { "answer": "Both fuels release the same energy per gram since both are hydrocarbons", "explanation": "Being hydrocarbons does not mean they have identical per-gram energy values." },

      "correctExplanation": "Reporting per mole standardises the value so it can be applied to any amount of substance.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Per mole is used because total energy cannot be measured in any experiment", "explanation": "Total energy can be measured; per mole is used for standardisation and comparison." },
        { "answer": "Per mole is used because reactions always involve exactly one mole of fuel", "explanation": "Reactions involve varying amounts; per mole standardises for comparison purposes." },
        { "answer": "Per mole is used because energy units cannot be divided by mass directly", "explanation": "Energy can be divided by mass (kJ per gram); per mole is a convention for standardisation." }

      "correct": "Not necessarily; per-gram values may differ depending on the molar masses of fuels",
      "correctExplanation": "Per-mole comparison ignores mass differences; the fuel with -286 kJ per mol could have higher per-gram energy.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Always correct; higher per-mole energy release means better fuel in all cases", "explanation": "Per-mole values do not account for mass differences; per-gram may tell a different story." },
        { "answer": "Always correct; the magnitude of delta-H per mol is the only relevant factor", "explanation": "Practical comparison also requires considering molar mass and energy per gram." },
