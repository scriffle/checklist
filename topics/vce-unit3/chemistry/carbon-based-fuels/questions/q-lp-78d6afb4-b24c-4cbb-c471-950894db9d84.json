      "question": "Evaluate the claim: 'Increasing light intensity will always increase the rate of photosynthesis.'",
      "correct": "The claim is incorrect because other factors like CO2 concentration or temperature can become limiting",
      "correctExplanation": "Beyond a certain point, increasing light has no effect if CO2 or enzyme capacity limits the rate; multiple factors interact.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because light is the only factor that affects photosynthesis rate", "explanation": "Students may think light is the sole factor; CO2 concentration and temperature also limit the rate." },
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because chlorophyll can absorb unlimited amounts of light energy", "explanation": "Students may think chlorophyll has infinite capacity; it saturates at high light intensities." },
        { "answer": "The claim is incorrect because light actually inhibits photosynthesis at all intensities", "explanation": "Students may overstate photoinhibition; light drives photosynthesis and only causes damage at extreme levels." }

      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Which conclusion is best supported by the observation that plants in shaded environments often have larger leaves than sun-exposed plants?",
      "correct": "Larger leaves increase the surface area for light absorption to compensate for lower light intensity",
      "correctExplanation": "In low-light conditions, plants adapt by growing larger leaves to capture more of the limited available light for photosynthesis.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Larger leaves are needed to release more heat because shaded areas are colder overall", "explanation": "Students may think leaf size relates to temperature regulation rather than light capture." },
        { "answer": "Larger leaves store more water because shaded environments are always much drier places", "explanation": "Students may confuse leaf size with water storage; larger leaves increase light capture area." },
        { "answer": "Larger leaves reduce photosynthesis so the plant does not produce too much glucose", "explanation": "Students may think larger leaves slow photosynthesis; they actually enhance light capture." }

      "question": "A scientist measures oxygen production by an aquatic plant at different light intensities. At high intensity, the rate plateaus. Which analysis best explains this?",
      "correct": "Another factor such as CO2 concentration has become the limiting factor for the reaction rate",
      "correctExplanation": "When light is abundant, CO2 availability or enzyme capacity limits the rate, causing the plateau despite increasing light.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The plant has reached its maximum oxygen storage capacity and cannot release any more", "explanation": "Students may think plants store oxygen; O2 is released continuously and does not accumulate in the plant." },
        { "answer": "High light intensity destroys all chlorophyll molecules so photosynthesis stops entirely", "explanation": "Students may overstate light damage; moderate high intensity causes a plateau, not complete destruction." },
        { "answer": "The measuring equipment has malfunctioned because oxygen production should always increase", "explanation": "Students may not accept plateaus as real; limiting factors are a well-established biological concept." }

      "question": "Compare a plant cell in bright sunlight with the same cell in complete darkness. Which analysis of gas exchange is correct?",
      "correct": "In sunlight the cell releases net oxygen, while in darkness it releases net carbon dioxide",
      "correctExplanation": "In light, photosynthesis exceeds respiration so net O2 is released. In darkness, only respiration occurs, releasing CO2.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "In sunlight the cell only photosynthesises, while in darkness it only performs respiration", "explanation": "Students may think the two processes are mutually exclusive; respiration occurs continuously, even in light." },
        { "answer": "In both conditions the cell releases equal amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide gas", "explanation": "Students may think gas exchange is constant; it changes dramatically with light availability." },
        { "answer": "In sunlight the cell releases carbon dioxide, while in darkness it releases oxygen gas", "explanation": "Students may reverse the gas exchange; photosynthesis produces O2 in light, respiration produces CO2 in dark." }

      "question": "Evaluate the statement: 'Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are exact reverse reactions.'",
      "correct": "This is an oversimplification because they involve different enzymes, organelles, and intermediate steps",
      "correctExplanation": "While the overall equations appear as reverses, the biochemical pathways, enzymes, and organelles involved are entirely different.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This is completely accurate because the equations are perfect mirror images of each other", "explanation": "Students may look only at the summary equations and miss that the mechanisms are completely different." },
        { "answer": "This is incorrect because photosynthesis and respiration have no chemical relationship at all", "explanation": "Students may overcorrect; the processes are related through their reactants and products." },
        { "answer": "This is accurate because both processes occur in exactly the same organelle in the cell", "explanation": "Students may not distinguish chloroplasts from mitochondria; these processes occur in different organelles." }

      "question": "Which inference is best supported by the fact that deforestation reduces global photosynthesis rates?",
      "correct": "Atmospheric CO2 levels would tend to rise because less CO2 is being absorbed by plant photosynthesis",
      "correctExplanation": "Fewer trees mean less CO2 is removed from the atmosphere, contributing to increased greenhouse gas concentrations.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Atmospheric oxygen would increase because trees normally consume oxygen for photosynthesis", "explanation": "Students may think trees consume oxygen during photosynthesis; they actually produce it." },
        { "answer": "Global temperatures would decrease because fewer trees means less heat is being produced", "explanation": "Students may think trees produce heat; deforestation actually contributes to warming through CO2 increase." },
        { "answer": "Ocean acidity would decrease because less CO2 means less carbonic acid forms in oceans", "explanation": "Students may get the direction wrong; more atmospheric CO2 from deforestation increases ocean acidity." }

      "correct": "It could help by converting atmospheric CO2 into useful products while generating oxygen gas",
      "correctExplanation": "Artificial photosynthesis mimics the natural process, potentially removing CO2 and producing fuels or chemicals.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It would be ineffective because only natural chlorophyll can carry out photosynthesis reactions", "explanation": "Students may think only biological chlorophyll works; synthetic catalysts can mimic the process." },
        { "answer": "It would increase CO2 levels because any artificial process must produce more carbon dioxide", "explanation": "Students may think artificial processes always emit CO2; artificial photosynthesis is designed to consume it." },
        { "answer": "It would be unnecessary because natural photosynthesis can already remove all excess CO2", "explanation": "Students may overestimate natural photosynthesis capacity; current rates cannot offset all human emissions." }

      "correct": "Early photosynthetic organisms gradually transformed the atmosphere from oxygen-poor to oxygen-rich",
      "correctExplanation": "Ancient cyanobacteria and later plants produced oxygen through photosynthesis, fundamentally changing atmospheric composition.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Oxygen has always been present in the atmosphere at the same concentration as it is today", "explanation": "Students may think atmospheric composition is static; photosynthesis dramatically changed O2 levels over time." },
        { "answer": "Photosynthesis removed all nitrogen from the early atmosphere and replaced it with oxygen", "explanation": "Students may think photosynthesis affected nitrogen levels; nitrogen was largely unaffected by photosynthesis." },
