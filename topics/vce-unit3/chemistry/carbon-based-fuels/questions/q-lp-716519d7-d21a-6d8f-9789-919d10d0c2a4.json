      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The ratio is fixed for each fuel and does not change regardless of the oxygen supply", "explanation": "Students may think products are fixed; the CO to C ratio varies with oxygen availability." },
        { "answer": "Higher temperature always produces more CO while lower temperature produces more carbon", "explanation": "Students may focus on temperature; oxygen supply is the primary factor determining products." },
        { "answer": "The molecular structure of the fuel determines whether CO or C forms, not oxygen supply", "explanation": "Students may think fuel structure alone determines products; oxygen availability is the key factor." }

      "question": "Compare the environmental impact of complete versus incomplete combustion of the same mass of octane fuel.",
      "correct": "Complete combustion produces more CO2 (a greenhouse gas) but incomplete produces toxic CO and particulates",
      "correctExplanation": "Complete combustion maximises CO2 emissions. Incomplete produces less CO2 but generates harmful CO and soot pollution.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Incomplete combustion is better for the environment because it produces less CO2 overall", "explanation": "Students may focus only on CO2; incomplete combustion produces toxic CO and harmful particulates." },
        { "answer": "Complete combustion has no environmental impact because CO2 and H2O are natural compounds", "explanation": "Students may dismiss CO2 as harmless; it is a significant greenhouse gas contributing to climate change." },

      "correct": "It reduces CO toxicity but does not recover the energy lost from incomplete fuel oxidation",
      "correctExplanation": "The converter removes toxic CO but the fuel has already released less energy than complete combustion would have.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It fully solves all problems because converting CO to CO2 recovers the lost energy too", "explanation": "Students may think converting CO to CO2 in the converter captures the lost energy for the engine." },
        { "answer": "It makes the problem worse by producing more CO2 which is a more dangerous greenhouse gas", "explanation": "Students may think CO2 is more dangerous than CO to humans; CO is acutely toxic while CO2 is a greenhouse gas." },
        { "answer": "It has no benefit because the CO produced during combustion cannot be further oxidised", "explanation": "Students may not know CO can be oxidised; catalytic converters successfully oxidise CO to CO2." }

      "correct": "The claim is incorrect; the blue flame is hotter because complete combustion releases more energy",
      "correctExplanation": "Complete combustion (blue flame) releases more energy per mole. The yellow colour comes from glowing soot, not higher temperature.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because the yellow colour indicates higher thermal energy in the flame", "explanation": "Students may associate bright colour with heat; the yellow glow is from soot, not higher temperature." },
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because soot particles store extra thermal energy making the flame hotter", "explanation": "Students may think soot adds energy; soot actually indicates energy loss from incomplete oxidation." },
        { "answer": "Both flames have exactly the same temperature because they burn the same type of fuel gas", "explanation": "Students may think temperature depends only on fuel; oxygen supply affects combustion completeness and temperature." }

      "correct": "Not all fuel is fully oxidised so less energy per gram of fuel is extracted for engine work",
      "correctExplanation": "Excess fuel means some undergoes incomplete combustion, releasing less energy and wasting fuel.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Fuel-rich mixtures burn faster so the energy is released too quickly to be used by engine", "explanation": "Students may think speed of burning causes inefficiency; it is incomplete oxidation that wastes fuel." },
        { "answer": "The extra fuel absorbs heat from the combustion making the overall process less exothermic", "explanation": "Students may think fuel absorbs heat; unburnt fuel is simply not oxidised, reducing energy output." },
        { "answer": "Fuel-rich mixtures produce more CO2 which absorbs engine heat and reduces work output", "explanation": "Students may think more CO2 forms; fuel-rich mixtures actually produce less CO2 and more CO." }

      "correctExplanation": "2 mol O2 provides enough for complete combustion. 1 mol O2 is insufficient, so CO forms instead of CO2.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both produce CO2 + 2H2O because methane always fully oxidises regardless of oxygen amount", "explanation": "Students may think methane always gives CO2; with insufficient O2, CO or C forms." },
        { "answer": "With 2 mol O2: 2CO + 2H2O; with 1 mol O2: CO2 + 2H2O because more oxygen makes CO", "explanation": "Students may reverse the relationship; more oxygen leads to CO2 (more oxidised), not CO." },
        { "answer": "With 2 mol O2: CO2 + 2H2O; with 1 mol O2: no reaction because 1 mol O2 is insufficient", "explanation": "Students may think combustion cannot occur with limited O2; it still occurs but incompletely." }

      "correctExplanation": "CO and solid carbon can be further oxidised to CO2, meaning they still hold unreleased chemical energy.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is invalid; all chemical energy is released regardless of whether CO or CO2 forms", "explanation": "Students may think all energy is released; CO and C retain energy that would be released by complete oxidation." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Only CO2 and H2O would form because 1.5 mol O2 is close enough to complete combustion", "explanation": "Students may think 1.5 is sufficient; it is 0.5 mol short of the 2 mol needed for complete combustion." },
        { "answer": "Only CO and H2O would form because any shortage of oxygen produces exclusively CO", "explanation": "Students may think it is all-or-nothing; intermediate O2 gives a mixture of CO and CO2." },
