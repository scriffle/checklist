TITLE: I can explain what genetic screening is and give examples of disorders it can detect
CODE: 3B.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
Genetic screening is a form of DNA profiling used to analyse an individual's DNA for a particular allele associated with a disorder. It can be conducted on adults (carrier testing), on a foetus (prenatal testing), or on newborns (postnatal testing).

WHY (importance):
Genetic screening allows early detection and treatment of genetic disorders, but also raises significant ethical questions about how the information should be used.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Prenatal genetic screening can detect conditions such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Huntington disease, and thalassaemia. Postnatal screening of newborns can detect phenylketonuria (PKU), allowing immediate dietary changes that prevent intellectual disability.

SUBTOPIC: DNA Profiling and Genetic Screening
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers DNA profiling using variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), interpreting gel electrophoresis results for profiling, genetic screening for inherited disorders, and the ethical, social, economic and biological implications of these technologies.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: DNA profiling is one of the most important real-world applications of DNA manipulation techniques. Understanding how VNTRs are used to identify individuals, and being able to interpret gel results, connects molecular tools to forensic science, paternity testing and genetic counselling.

TOPIC: DNA Manipulation Techniques and Their Applications
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The use of molecular tools to manipulate DNA, including restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, PCR and gel electrophoresis, and their applications in DNA profiling, gene cloning for insulin production, genetically modified organisms, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.

ENGAGE
Forensic science on TV
As you may have seen in crime dramas like CSI or NCIS, the investigators are able to
obtain DNA samples from a crime scene, get them back to the lab and have a result
all within a few hours. Often, they carry out a number of DNA techniques to help
solve a crime, within a 40-minute episode. In reality, even though the same methods
are used, the process is much slower. Some of the DNA analysis tools explored in
this section, such as
restriction enzymes,
gel electrophoresis
and the polymerase
chain reaction, take
many hours to run. In
addition to the time
that these methods
take, prior analysis and
preparation of materials
are required. The TV
versions also do not
account for the fact that
some techniques need
to be run one after the
other, in order to obtain
meaningful results.

The importance of DNA
DNA is a macromolecule that is passed from pre-existing cells to new cells. In this way,
offspring inherit their DNA from their parent(s). As you learned in Section 2B, each cell of
an organism contains the entire complement of the organism’s DNA, also known as their
genome. This chapter focuses on applying your knowledge of the structure and function of
DNA and how different molecular tools can be used to manipulate this DNA.

Molecular tools
Restriction enzymes
Restriction enzymes (also known as restriction endonucleases) are proteins that act like
molecular scissors, cutting the sugar–phosphate backbone of DNA at a specific region,
known as a recognition (restriction) site (Figure 3A–2).

may make cuts at different places on the two chains.
PPS
Restriction enzymes occur naturally in bacteria (some are also found in viruses, archaea and
eukaryotes), where they serve the same ‘scissor-like’ purpose but for a defence mechanism.
They cut the DNA of a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria, shown in Figure 3A–3)
into fragments. The bacterium’s own DNA is protected from these restriction enzymes by
chemical modification and enzymes that modify the bacterial DNA so it is not recognised
by the restriction enzyme, or by simply not having the recognition site in the first place.

Differences between restriction enzymes
There are more than 3000 different restriction enzymes, with only around 600 of these
commercially available to scientists. Each restriction enzyme recognises a specific
recognition site in the DNA. Restriction enzymes are therefore named based on the
following international guidelines:
• abbreviation, in letters, of the name of the bacterium in which they are naturally found
• Roman numerals after the letters to classify the specific enzyme from the same
bacterium (as usually there is more than one).
As an example, HaeIII is the third endonuclease isolated from the bacterium Haemophilus
aegyptius. Table 3A–1 shows HaeIII and four other restriction enzymes, to highlight the
differences between them.

RESTRICTION
ENDONUCLEASES
Note the red arrows in column two of Table 3A–1. These indicate the location in the
sugar–phosphate backbone where the specific restriction enzyme digests (cuts) the DNA.
This location within the recognition site determines whether the fragments of DNA
produced from this will result in sticky ends or blunt ends (shown in columns three and
four). Note also that each recognition site is usually 4–6 base pairs long and is a palindrome.
This means they read the same in a 5′ (5 prime) to 3′ (3 prime) direction on the template
strand as they do on the coding strand, remembering that the two strands of DNA run in
opposite directions, as you learned in Section 2A.
For example, in EcoRI (in Table 3A–1), the coding strand reads GAATTC and the template
strand reads GAATTC, if looking at both from the 5′ end first.

DNA ligase
In genetic engineering, sometimes two fragments of DNA need to be joined. This is
essentially the reverse effect of restriction enzymes, which digest DNA. To join fragments
of DNA, an enzyme is required, as is the case for most processes that occur within the
body. This enzyme is called DNA ligase . Its role is to catalyse the joining of pieces of double-
stranded DNA at their sugar–phosphate backbone. This joining of fragments of DNA can
create a longer linear strand of DNA, or even a circular DNA molecule. It can also join
fragments of DNA from different species. These techniques are explored in Section 3B. DNA ligase

Figure 3A–4 DNA ligase acts as a ‘glue’ that joins two fragments of DNA together at the sugar–
phosphate backbone.
The types of ends matter for DNA ligase
As you will recall, blunt end fragments of DNA are produced when the restriction enzyme
cuts straight across the sugar–phosphate backbone of both DNA strands. As they have no
overhanging nucleotides, DNA ligase is able to join them with any other fragment of DNA
that also has a blunt end, though with more difficulty than when there are overhangs. This
is random and not overly specific.
Sticky end fragments are produced when the restriction enzyme cuts between the same
pair of nucleotides in the palindromic recognition site on each strand of DNA. This
results in overhanging nucleotides that DNA ligase can only join to another fragment
of DNA containing complementary overhanging nucleotides. If not, the overhanging
nucleotides would not form complementary base pairs due to hydrogen bonding between
the nitrogenous bases A and T, and C and G, as you learned in Section 2A. Therefore,
this fragment must also have been cut with the same restriction enzyme (shown in
Figure 3A–4 ), making sticky ends of DNA more specific than blunt ends.

Polymerase chain reaction
In order to work effectively with DNA, it is necessary to have more than a single copy or a
few copies of it. Therefore, a simple method is needed to amplify the DNA to produce large
quantities in a short amount of time. This method is called the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). As you will see later in this section, PCR is particularly useful for forensic scientists to
amplify certain regions of the DNA from traces of blood found at a crime scene.
The polymerase chain reaction uses a mixture of ingredients that are heated and cooled
in cycles. After each cycle, the number of copies of the DNA is doubled. At the beginning
of the process, the ingredients are added to a microtube, which is then placed in a
thermocycler (a machine that acts as a heating block to rapidly change the temperature for
each stage). The stages of the cycle are outlined in Table 3A–2.

PCR is an extremely sensitive process. Any contamination in the original DNA template or
mistake made in a cycle means the same mistake will be copied over and over again through
each cycle. Therefore, for this process to work effectively, great care is required in the
preparation of samples and the regulation of temperature.

ELECTROPHORESIS
DOC
Gel electrophoresis
Biologists usually work with large amounts of DNA and long strands of DNA. This means
that when a sample of DNA is mixed with restriction enzyme(s), fragments of differing
lengths are produced. Often, biologists are only interested in one section of this DNA and
so they need to isolate the relevant fragment. This is made even more difficult because
DNA is too small to see and is colourless. This is where gel electrophoresis proves valuable.
The basic process of gel electrophoresis is as follows:
1 Digested samples containing the DNA fragments and a dye are loaded into wells at one
end of an agarose gel.
2 The gel is covered in a solution containing ions, which allows the movement of DNA
fragments when an electric field is applied to the gel through a negative electrode at the
well end and a positive electrode at the other end. DNA is negatively charged due to the
phosphate groups.
3 The negatively charged DNA migrates from the wells at the negative electrode of the gel
towards the positive electrode. DNA from each well stays in the ‘lane’ running from each
well. The DNA fragments separate according to their size and the charge they carry.
Smaller DNA fragments travel faster (and therefore further) than larger fragments.
4 The dye in the samples travels faster than the DNA and, when the ‘dye front’ (its
position) reaches the positive electrode, the power is turned off and the gel plate is
removed for analysis.
5 At the end, when the agarose gel has been removed, a different dye that attaches to DNA
can be added and this reveals where the DNA fragments are.

NOTE
All DNA fragments of the same size in a sample will migrate to the same distance from the well
and end up at the same point in that lane. The particular fragment that a scientist is seeking can
then be cut out from the gel and used in experiments.
The reason for adding ‘loading’ dye to the sample at the beginning is that DNA is colourless
and during the ‘run’ the operator can’t see how far it has moved. This allows a scientist to
determine the time at which to stop the gel electrophoresis process, and therefore the time
at which the DNA fragments have had the longest to separate. The ‘invisibility’ of the DNA
is also the reason for using a different dye to reveal it on the agarose gel. Dyes that fluoresce
under ultraviolet light can also be attached to the DNA. The glowing patches can then be
digitally photographed for analysis.
The importance of a control
In gel electrophoresis, conditions can vary each time a gel is run. These conditions include the:
• voltage of the power source
• percentage of agarose in the gel (agarose is a polysaccharide added to the gel to control
the rate at which fragments move through the gel)
• concentration of the solution (a ‘buffer’) covering the agarose gel
• temperature of the environment
• pH of the buffer solution
• length of time the sample of DNA is allowed to run for in the gel
• length of the gel (distance between the negative and positive electrodes).
As such, the distance that particular-sized fragments of DNA will migrate through the
gel will not be the same every time. This means scientists cannot use something as simple
as a ruler to measure the distance
bp
travelled by a fragment of DNA to
determine its size.
10 000
One lane in the gel must always
be used to run a control. In gel
electrophoresis, this is called a DNA
standard , or DNA ladder. A DNA
standard is a DNA sample that has
been digested with a particular
restriction enzyme that produces
many different-sized fragments
of DNA with known lengths.
These DNA standards are usually
purchased and come with a pictorial
representation of the fragments
expected to be seen on a gel and
their respective sizes, usually in base
pairs (bp) or kilo base pairs (kbp).
This allows the scientist to compare
the sizes of the fragments in their
DNA sample to the fragments with
known size from the DNA standard
( Figure 3A–7 ).

The result of gel electrophoresis is a series of parallel bands of DNA fragments at different
distances along the gel. The sizes of these unknown fragments are determined by
comparing them to the sizes of known fragments of DNA in the DNA standard.

Applying knowledge of DNA structure to restriction enzymes
Recall from Section 2A that the structure of DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is
different. In prokaryotes the DNA is circular, whereas in eukaryotes the DNA is linear.
This has a huge impact on the number of fragments that can be produced from digestion
with restriction enzymes. It also means that reading the question correctly is crucial.
For example:
Question:
In this linear piece of DNA, the restriction enzyme BglII has two recognition sites.
How many fragments would be produced?
BglII BglII
740 kbp
Answer:
Three
However, if the question was worded slightly differently, a different answer would be
required. For example:
Question:
The following DNA taken from a prokaryote was digested with the restriction
enzyme BglII, which has two recognition sites. How many fragments would be
produced?
BglII BglII
740 kbp

The key to reading this question is to understand that DNA from prokaryotic cells is
circular. Even though the figure shows linear DNA, it is there to test whether you have
read the question carefully and understand the differences between different types of
cells. The parts of each question marked in yellow above are examples of what would be
good for you to highlight or underline as you are reading through the question.
Use of a heat-resistant DNA polymerase in PCR
The DNA polymerase used for PCR comes from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus
aquaticus, which has evolved to live in extremely hot environments. As such, the optimal
temperature for its enzymes is approximately 72°C. As the optimal temperature for this
enzyme is so high, it is not denatured (three-dimensional functional shape permanently
altered – more on this in Section 4B) even when heating to temperatures above 90°C.
As you can imagine, this is very different to the optimal temperature of the same DNA
polymerase enzymes typically found in humans and other animals, which have an
optimal temperature of 37°C.
Questions will be along the lines of: ‘Why can’t human DNA polymerase be used in the
PCR process?’. The answer to this is as explained above, and it means you need to be
able to apply your understanding of different concepts across topics. You should always
provide a comparison in this case between the two, and reference to the specific stage
that would affect the enzyme here.

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics
The traditional method of producing insulin for treating diabetes involved extracting
insulin from the pancreas of pigs and cows. A problem with this technique was that
some people developed antibodies against animal insulin, which made it ineffective.
Insulin is now produced by recombinant DNA techniques, in which the human
insulin-producing gene is inserted into bacteria.

Pig pancreas Insulin extracted Insulin purified, pasteurised and bottled
Figure 3B–1 Insulin was originally taken from the pancreas of pigs and cows.
However, bacteria can transfer plasmids (circular rings of DNA) between each other and
also to different species of bacteria. For this reason there has been some trepidation on
the part of scientists in using bacteria to make copies of human genes. Their concerns
centre on the fact that, even though these bacteria are modified in strict isolation and
under tightly controlled conditions, the process may inadvertently create a strain of
genetically modified bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.
As you will see in this section, in the process of gene cloning, the use of antibiotic-
resistance genes in plasmids to identify bacteria with the inserted human genes is
gradually being replaced by the use of enzymes that make fluorescent substances.
The most common example, which you can do in the school laboratory, is using an
enzyme from jellyfish that produces a green fluorescent protein (GFP). As the name
suggests, these jellyfish fluoresce green when exposed to UV light. In the same way that
the gene of interest would be inserted into the plasmid, the gene for GFP is inserted,
thereby avoiding the need to use antibiotic resistance genes.

The application of DNA manipulation techniques
DNA profiling
The main use of the process of gel electrophoresis, which you studied in Section 3A, in
forensic science is in DNA profiling, or DNA fingerprinting.
In DNA profiling, analysts need to find unique patterns that will identify an individual.
Regions of DNA that code for certain proteins or enzymes are not useful for DNA profiling,
because they code for products or functions that are the same in everyone. So analysts
instead study stretches of non-coding regions of DNA. These are called ‘short tandem
repeats’ (STRs) if they are 2–6 base pairs long, or variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs)
if they are longer, typically 20–60 base pairs. The number of repeats can vary between
individuals. If only one region was focused on, the number of repeats of the sequence
could be the same in two individuals. Therefore, in humans, 13 of these VNTR regions are
studied in DNA profiling, so the chance of two individuals having exactly the same number
of nucleotide repeats at each location would be very low. In fact, only identical twins have
the same VNTRs at each region. Each individual has some VNTRs (and STRs) that come
from their parents. The VNTRs can be inherited from either the mother or the father and
can be a combination of both. An individual’s VNTRs will never have sequences that are
not present in their parents. Each individual has two copies of each VNTR, because they
are alleles, one from each pair of homologous chromosomes (chromosomes of the same size,
centromere and banding pattern from the mother and father).

nucleotide sequence GATTC. One chromosome is inherited from the mother and the other from
the father.
Therefore, VNTRs can be used to identify a criminal from biological evidence found at a
crime scene, or to identify the father of a child in a paternity test. The steps in this process
are as follows:
1 DNA is extracted from the cells obtained from an individual (e.g. blood, semen or hair
from a crime scene).
2 The DNA of the 13 different VNTR regions (or a set number of these) is amplified by
PCR.
3 The DNA is cut with specific restriction enzymes (or multiple restriction enzymes) that
have recognition sites at either side of the VNTR regions.
4 The DNA fragments are loaded into wells on agarose gel and separated by gel
electrophoresis.
Smaller alleles, or nucleotide sequences of DNA, have fewer repeats of the short sequence
and will therefore migrate faster and further through the agarose gel than larger alleles with
more repeats. This is shown in Figure 3B–3.

PPS
In addition to forensic scientists using DNA profiling to identify the perpetrator of a crime,
or geneticists using it to determine a paternal parent, this technique can be used to:
• identify victims following a mass disaster
• identify human or animal fossils that can provide information about possible
evolutionary links
• develop a DNA database of wildlife. If there are only a few bands that differ between
individuals, indicating little genetic diversity, conservation measures can be
implemented to maximise that species’ chances of survival. Hence, breeding programs
could be initiated by zoos where genetically different individuals are bred to increase the
genetic diversity of the species.

Genetic screening
Genetic screening is a form of DNA profiling used to analyse an individual’s DNA for
a particular version of a gene (allele) they might be carrying. Genetic screening can be
conducted on adults when they suspect they may be carrying an allele for a disorder they
could pass onto their offspring. It can also be conducted on a foetus to test for the presence
of a disorder (prenatal testing) or on a newborn baby (postnatal testing). It is used to
identify cases where a baby may develop disorders such as those listed in Table 3B–1.
Many other common medical conditions can be detected as part of postnatal testing,
including phenylketonuria (PKU) and hypothyroidism. The benefit of screening for these
conditions is that it allows immediate treatment and/or changes in lifestyle to reduce the
negative effects of the condition.

Implications of DNA analysis technologies: overview
In selecting a DNA analysis/application technique to use, scientists need to consider the
ethical, social, economic and biological implications of that technology. It is also important
to identify the stakeholder and how the technology is likely to affect them, directly or
indirectly. The stakeholder is anyone (or an organisation) who will be affected by the
technology. Table 3B–2 outlines these implications.
Table 3B–2 Ethical, social, economic and biological implications of DNA analysis technology
Implication Definition Relation to stakeholder
Ethical A sense of right or wrong
in producing or obtaining
the technology, based on
morals and beliefs
The decision to engage with a technology will depend on the
individual’s personal ethical considerations.
Conducting scientific research involving humans or animals (e.g.
drug trials) requires approval by an ethics committee.
Social The influence of the
technology on society,
rather than just one or
two individuals
An individual’s decision making is influenced by the context
they are in. For example, different countries, or even different
communities within the same country, have different attitudes about
what is socially acceptable in regards to different technologies.
Government legislation is also different from country to country.
Economic The availability of funds
to obtain or produce the
technology
The cost of developing and using some technologies can be
prohibitive, and so they may not be equally accessible to all.
It is also important to consider who is funding the technology. For
example, results might be biased by emphasising positive outcomes
and downplaying negative outcomes.
Biological The effect of a
technology on other living
organisms in a particular
environment
The use of some technologies can affect the survival of other
organisms within an ecosystem. It may also change the course of
evolution, for better or worse.
The questions raised about these issues, and their answers, will depend on their context
and which stakeholder’s viewpoint is being considered. This is discussed further in the
3B Skills section.

Implications of DNA profiling and genetic screening
Ethical
DOC
Essentially, ethics deal with questions of right or wrong, or ‘Should I or shouldn’t I?’ In the case
of DNA profiling and genetic screening, some examples of questions to be dealt with are:
• Informed consent for DNA sampling – this is an issue
for children under the age of 18 years, who at the time
of having a DNA sample collected rely on parents to
provide consent on their behalf.
• Secure storage of DNA information – who has access to
this information and what would happen if it fell into the
wrong hands? For example, could insurance companies
make it difficult or costly for an individual to obtain
health or life insurance if they were identified as having a
genetic predisposition to developing a disease?
• Reliability of DNA analysis results as evidence of a foetus
having a genetically inherited disorder – if a foetus is
identified as having the genetic potential to develop
a particular disorder, the parents are then faced with
Figure 3B–4 Parents being counselled on results
of genetic testing and their likelihood of having a
child with a genetic disorder
the decision of whether to abort the foetus. Different
governments have their own regulations concerning this.
An example of the third point is a couple finding out that they might both be carriers of
the allele for Huntington disease. This is a late-onset condition that might not become
apparent until after they have a child. Would they want to know before having a child, if
their offspring could develop the condition? Would this change their own quality of life?
Remember, they might not develop the disease.

AND
IMPLICATIONS
Social
Social implications refer to the impact of the technology on more than one or two
individuals. For DNA profiling and genetic screening, some examples of questions to be
addressed are:
• The possibility of incorrect identification of a suspect from a sample of DNA obtained
from a crime scene – this could be caused by contamination of DNA. This would not
only affect the individual who has been wrongfully accused, as well as their partner
and/or immediate family, but would also have implications for the judicial system as a
whole (fairness/justice). So the question is: Is it right to convict a person based solely on
DNA evidence?
• Privacy of the information obtained from a DNA profile or genetic screen – for example,
what would the implications be for society if a DNA profile was held of every person,
even those not convicted of a crime? In Victoria, a DNA sample cannot be obtained
from a person unless they give permission. This gives the person the opportunity to
know beforehand the risks associated with storage of the information and, if digital
results are hacked or compromised, who might access their personal DNA information.
• Information about the possibility of inheriting a genetic disease – intending parents
might be faced with difficult reproductive decisions. This could be heightened
depending on whether they are planning to have a child or are already pregnant. They
could be faced with the ethical implications of choosing to terminate a pregnancy. This
could place strain on their relationship, and they might seek professional counselling.
• People who have a genetic predisposition to certain conditions may find they are
discriminated against by employers, insurers or other bodies.

Economic
Economic considerations refer to the cost implications of the technology – how it affects
individuals directly, as well as others in the community. For DNA profiling and genetic
screening, an example of questions to be addressed is:
• Expense of treatment – if a couple was informed of the risk of their potential offspring
inheriting a genetic disorder, their decision about whether to undergo IVF must include
the cost of treatment, as IVF is expensive. If the couple chose not to have a child, this
would avoid the expense not only for themselves, but for society, of providing the
medical and educational support that would be required for an affected child.
Biological
Biological implications can affect not only the organism in question, but more than one
organism or species. For DNA profiling and genetic screening, an example of questions
raised is:
• Altering the affected genome – for some inherited disorders, it may be possible to
correct the mutation that causes the condition, using gene editing. (This also raises
ethical issues.) The biological implications could be very significant for humans. For
example, gene editing can be seen as ‘interfering’ with evolution, by altering the future
inheritance of traits (alleles), some of which may disappear from the population.

Gene cloning
The universal nature of DNA
DNA is universal, but what does this mean? ‘Universal’ refers to the fact that the basic
structure of DNA is the same in every organism. The building blocks (monomers) you
learned about in Section 2A are identical in structure. The nitrogenous bases (adenine,
cytosine, guanine and thymine, and their complementarity) that make up part of these
monomers are identical. In essence this means that the DNA of one species can be
combined with the DNA of a different species, using a range of DNA manipulation
techniques, which were explored in Section 3A.
 Nowadays, genetic engineers can create genes, and
even complete genomes for some species, by using
artificial nucleotides in a laboratory setting. They
can work backwards from the desired final protein
sequence, by looking at the specific chain of amino
acids, identifying mRNA codons that code for these
and then using stored computer software to synthesise
the DNA nucleotides. This built sequence of DNA can
then be inserted directly into a plasmid (circular piece
of DNA in prokaryotes), all without the need for a
physical DNA template.

The gene cloning process combines the use of a plasmid with some of the DNA manipulation
techniques outlined in Section 3A. The key steps of this process in relation to inserting
the human insulin gene into bacteria for insulin protein production, which is vital in the
treatment of type I diabetes (T1D), are outlined in Figure 3B–8. If you studied Unit 1
Biology, you will already know that this disorder results from the cells that produce insulin,
beta cells in the pancreas, being targeted for destruction by the immune system. This is
known as an autoimmune disease. You will learn more about these types of diseases in
Section 7D.
Insulin is a vital protein-based hormone, responsible for controlling blood glucose levels by
reducing the concentration of blood glucose when it becomes too high. The process of gene
cloning (outlined in Figure 3B–8) is a way of mass-producing insulin for people with T1D.

100 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
Cloning the human insulin genes for treating type I diabetes
Two genes express the two distinct polypeptide chains that form human insulin. Steps 1-6 are done twice, once for
each gene, in different bacterial cultures. The two polypeptide chains are combined in Step 7 to form insulin.
Step 1: Opening up the plasmid
 Plasmid is cut with the specific restriction enzyme. This makes the initially circular DNA temporarily linear.
Antibiotic
resistance gene
Restriction
enzyme cuts ‘Sticky’ ends
Plasmid from bacteria In this example, the enzyme
produces sticky ends
Step 2: Isolating the gene of interest
Gene of interest (the DNA coding for the insulin protein) is cut using a specific restriction enzyme.
Insulin gene
Restriction enzymes Any introns in this area are
also removed in this step
Insulin gene
Sticky end Sticky end
If the restriction enzyme in step 1 was one that resulted in ‘sticky end’ fragments, then the same restriction
enzyme must be used to cut the gene of interest as well. The ‘sticky ends’ must be complementary.
If the restriction enzyme was one that resulted in ‘blunt end’ fragments, any other blunt end restriction enzyme
may be used.
Step 3: Recombinant plasmids
The plasmid and gene of interest and β-galactosidase gene are mixed together with the enzyme DNA ligase which
joins them with phosphodiester bonds. This results in a closed circular piece of DNA again. This is called the
recombinant plasmid, as it has ‘recombined’ with a piece of foreign DNA.

Note: At this step it is common for the circular plasmid to re-join to itself with the help of DNA ligase, therefore
without taking up the gene of interest. This is referred to as a non-recombinant plasmid. The β-galactosidase
gene is taken up in recombinant plasmids as a marker for them, detected by a simple test.

Step 4: Genetic transformation
Recombinant plasmids (and
non-recombinant plasmids)
are mixed with bacteria. They
are then soaked in a solution
containing calcium ions (e.g.
calcium chloride) and heat
shocked. This opens up the pores
in the cell membrane of the bacteria,
increasing the chances of them
taking up the recombinant plasmid.

Note: Less than 1% of the bacteria actually take up the recombinant plasmid. Most of the
time the bacteria do not take up the plasmid at all, or take up the non-recombinant plasmid
(mentioned in the note in step 3). This process is very sensitive and if the heat shock is not
done for exactly the right time and at the correct temperature, then no transformation occurs.

Step 5: Bacteria reproduce
Bacterial reproduction (binary fission) results in
clones forming that are genetically identical to the
parent cell (this process occurs every 20 minutes,
doubling the number of cells each time – and
the number of plasmids increases even more,
as they replicate independently of the bacterial
reproduction). The insulin and marker genes are
expressed, producing fused insulin polypeptide
and β-galactosidase protein in every bacterial cell.

Step 6: Identifying bacteria with the recombinant plasmid
The traditional method of doing
this step is to use the antibiotic
resistance genes found naturally in
plasmids as a way of locating the
transformed bacteria (those that
have taken up the recombinant
plasmid) from untransformed
bacteria (those that have not taken
up the recombinant plasmid).

bacteria

with antibiotic
The bacteria are spread onto a
nutrient agar plate containing an antibiotic . Only those transformed bacteria that contain
the gene for antibiotic resistance are able to survive. Untransformed bacteria, which have
no plasmid, and therefore no antibiotic resistance gene, do not survive in this environment.
However, there are ethical concerns about using this technique. As the bacteria are able
to transfer plasmids between each other, and even to other species of bacteria (bacterial
conjugation), it is possible that this may result in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, possibly creating a ‘superbug’.
Another method of identifying bacteria with the recombinant plasmid is a test for the β-galactosidase protein made
by the marker gene. As in this example, the two methods may be used together.

a substance that inhibits
the growth of bacteria;
an example is penicillin
Step 7: Extracting, purifying and combining the insulin polypeptides
Steps 1-6 have been performed twice in separate bacterial cultures to
produce a polypeptide from each of the two insulin genes. The two types
of polypeptide are separated from the β-galactosidase protein, purified,
and then combined together to produce functional insulin, ready to
provide to diabetic patients.

Implications of gene cloning
Ethical
The use of bacteria for gene cloning has overcome the ethical and animal welfare issues
associated with extracting proteins, like insulin, from animals such as pigs and cattle, or
from the cells of human donors. However, some people view the transfer of genes from one
species to another as unethical, regardless of the overall benefit it could provide to society.
Social
There are many advantages of gene cloning for society, including:
• reduced cost of therapeutics made with bacteria, providing greater access to treatments
for more individuals in the community
• the creation of employment opportunities in the biotechnology industry, as well as
marketing and sales of these products.
A potential disadvantage of gene cloning is its misuse for non-therapeutic purposes, such as
creating performance-enhancing drugs, giving athletes an unfair advantage in competitions.
Economic
An economic advantage of using bacteria for gene cloning is that it has made the
production of therapeutics, like insulin for diabetics, relatively cheap – large quantities can
be produced, with a reliable (constant) supply. However, it is still important to note that
this benefit depends on the country and the socioeconomic background of the individual.
Biological
Inserting human genes into plasmids, creating a recombinant plasmid, and performing
genetic transformation to make copies of proteins to give to patients, provides a purer or
more effective product than using proteins purified from animals. This has made new and
safer treatments for disorders and the development of vaccines possible. It also reduces the
chances of side effects or of transmitting diseases. The use of vaccines reduces the number
of deaths from diseases, and this contributes to an increase in the average life expectancy
of the population. This results in the birth rate increasing more than the death rate, and
the increase in the world’s population increases the strain on the environment and affects
other species that share our ecosystems. In the long term, this changes the course of natural
selection and our evolution.
The risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (superbugs) developing has already been outlined.
Such a development would be very difficult to overcome. This is covered in more detail in
Section 9C.

3B SKILLS
Gene cloning over PCR?
Through all the steps of gene cloning, you might have asked, ‘Why doesn’t the scientist just
isolate the insulin gene of interest and then use PCR to amplify this section of DNA?’
The answer is threefold.
1 While PCR makes copies of DNA, genetic engineers need to know that this insulin
gene can be converted into a fully functioning protein. For this to occur, there must
be a set-up in which protein synthesis can take place, and this requires the different
types of RNA and ribosomes that you learned about in Section 2C.
2 Bacteria reproduce by binary fission every 20 minutes – this means that every
20 minutes, the number of bacteria doubles. Even within this time, plasmids replicate
independently of the bacteria. Therefore, even more plasmids, and therefore copies of
the insulin gene, can be produced in every reproductive cell cycle.
3 PCR requires a number of expensive ingredients: samples of the four nucleotides, a
heat-resistant enzyme, and forward and reverse primers. In comparison, the use of
restriction enzymes and bacteria, like E. coli, is inexpensive.
Determining whether transformed bacteria have taken up the recombinant or
non-recombinant plasmid
The advantage of plasmids is that they usually contain, or can be constructed to contain,
genes that code for antibiotic resistance. This gives bacteria with that plasmid a survival
advantage in the presence of the antibiotic that they have resistance to.
Common examination questions in this topic involve how the transformed bacteria are
identified. To determine which bacteria are transformed, the bacteria are grown on agar
nutrient plates containing an antibiotic (e.g. ampicillin). The recombinant plasmid that
has been taken up by transformed bacteria has a gene for resistance. It is important to
recall here that it is also possible for transformed bacteria that contain a non-recombinant
plasmid (without the gene of interest) to survive, as they still contain the antibiotic-
resistance gene. This is shown in Figure 3B–9.

104 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
Figure 3 B–9 shows that three types of bacteria are possible after genetic transformation:
• containing no plasmid (very common)
• containing the non-recombinant plasmid
• containing the recombinant plasmid.
If all three types of bacteria are grown on an agar plate containing antibiotic, both types
of transformed bacteria will survive and reproduce. So how can a scientist work out
which bacteria contain the recombinant plasmid and which contain the non-recombinant
plasmid?
Hopefully you have worked out that the plasmids could be isolated from the bacteria
and run on gel electrophoresis. Th e recombinant plasmids with the foreign DNA inserted
should be larger than the non-recombinant plasmids without the foreign DNA. Th is is
shown in Figure 3 B–10.

Answering questions about ethical and social implications
As mentioned in this chapter, when discussing the implications of gene cloning, it is
crucial to identify the stakeholder. Th e following question from the 2019 VCAA Biology
exam highlights this.

Question:
The Genomics Health Futures Mission will run a $32 million trial, starting in 2019, to
screen over 10 000 couples who are in early pregnancy or who are planning to have a
baby. Using a blood test, individuals will be screened for over 500 severe or deadly
gene mutations.
Couples will be told they have a genetic mutation if both individuals in the couple
carry the same mutation. The trial may lead to a population-wide carrier screening
program. The researchers will evaluate cost effectiveness, psychological impact, ethics
and barriers to screening. It is anticipated that future tests will be free of charge.
The test may find that a couple who were planning to have a baby or who were
already pregnant both carry the same severe or deadly mutation.
Describe one ethical and one social issue/implication that could arise from this finding.
For this question, the stakeholder is the couple. Many answers would focus on the child
as the stakeholder or the future impact on the child, but the question clearly asks for the
implication that arises from this finding. The table below shows answers that would be
acceptable or not acceptable, for each implication.
Answer:
Ethical:
Acceptable answers Unacceptable answers
Possible termination of the foetus Child is given up for adoption.
(Wrong, as the couple is only planning or
already pregnant but have not had the child)
Should a severely affected child,
who may suffer, be born?
The child may live a poor-quality life.
(Again, the child is not born yet)
Should alternative reproductive
therapies (like IVF) be accessed?
Issues for the child in knowing they have the
gene for the disease, as they did not give
consent for the test.
(Wrong, as this is not directly related to the
parents finding out this information.)
Who else has access to the
information from this finding?
What if insurance companies refuse to provide
life insurance to this individual in the future, if
they carry this disease-related gene?
(Wrong, as the gene in question would cause
health effects in the child, not the parents.)

It is important to practise answering these types of questions. Examples of questions
from the perspective of different stakeholders are provided at the end of this section and
in the chapter review and digital questions.
Linking ideas in a sequential nature
When answering questions, you should do so in a sequential way, although this isn’t
always easy. It can require you to change the way you think about what is happening.
Answering questions in this way helps the examiner see what you are thinking, and to
identify that you know your content and are able to link ideas together.
Let’s look at how to approach a question of this nature.
Question:
Explain the different types of enzymes used in the process of gene cloning. (2 marks)
Answer:
• To open up the plasmid and isolate the foreign DNA from an organism, the
strands need to be cut with restriction enzymes. These are enzymes that identify a
specific recognition site and cut the DNA at the sugar–phosphate backbone of the
two strands.
• For the plasmid and foreign DNA to be joined together, they may need to be cut
with the same restriction enzyme that produces complementary sticky ends.
• To join the two pieces of DNA together, the enzyme DNA ligase is used. This
enzyme works in the opposite way to a restriction enzyme, as a ‘glue’ joining
nucleotides at the sugar–phosphate backbone.

ENGAGE
The evolution of genetically modified organisms
Genetic modification really took off in 1973 when two scientists, Stanley Cohen and
Herbert Boyer, successfully removed an antibiotic resistance gene from one species of
bacteria (donor) and placed it into another species of bacteria (recipient). The recipient
bacteria then demonstrated antibiotic resistance.
You might think this is where the story begins, but humans have actually been ‘modifying’
organisms for thousands of years. As far back as 30 000 BC, humans were changing the
DNA of a particular species through the process of selective breeding, also referred to as
artificial selection, which you will learn more about in Chapter 9. What was this species? It
is one you are familiar with, if you look around when you go for a walk, watch TV or visit
a pet store: dogs! Our ancestors domesticated wild wolves in Eastern Asia and selectively
bred individuals to produce offspring that were initially more passive and compliant.
From there, and over thousands of
years, everything from hair length,
body shape and size, to colour, has
been selected for, resulting in the
many breeds that exist today. The
difference between selective breeding
and the current method of genetic
modification is that the process is
now much faster and does not require
many generations to pass before
change is noticeable.
With the rise of genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) and the
accompanying interest in them,
various stakeholders have expressed
their concerns about the implications,
for our own health and, more broadly,
that of the world’s ecosystems. As a
result, regulation of experiments and
appropriate safety measures have been
established for researchers, who also
educate others in the broader scientific
community about the significance of
their findings.

3C GENETICALLy MODIFIED AND TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS
111
EXPLAIN
Genetically modified vs transgenically modified organisms
As discussed in Section 3B, genetic engineering involves the transfer of DNA from one
organism to another, resulting in recombinant DNA. If the recipient organism has had its
own genome modified (e.g. genes being switched on or off), or contains DNA from a donor
of the same species, then it is referred to as a genetically modified organism (GMO). However,
if the recipient organism contains DNA from a different species, then it is referred to as
a transgenically modified organism (TMO) (trans = across, genic = gene), or transgenic. The
bacteria used in the process of gene cloning for the human insulin gene (in Section 3B)
would be referred to as both genetically modified (their DNA has been manipulated) and
transgenic (they contain human DNA).

Increasing crop productivity
Making photosynthesis more efficient
When plants undergo photosynthesis, the process is not 100% efficient, as you will learn
in Section 5E. The process generates by-products that are damaging to the cellular
components that convert light into chemical energy, and increasing global temperatures are
causing this to occur more regularly.
Normally when chlorophyll in the grana of chloroplasts absorbs light, water is split,
creating oxygen, hydrogen ions and electrons. The electrons help to power photosynthesis.
However, heat can damage a key protein, D1, involved in this process. As such, scientists
have genetically modified plants, such as the mustard plant, tobacco and rice, to better
repair the damage caused by heat.
As you learned in Section 2B, DNA codes for proteins. In plant cells, DNA is located in
the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Chloroplast DNA codes for proteins that are
used by the chloroplast, like the D1 protein that is affected by heat. The issue with the
chloroplast DNA is that it is much harder to modify than nuclear DNA. Scientists have
removed the gene coding for this protein using restriction enzymes, combined it with a
section of DNA that is activated during ‘heat stress’ and moved it into the nucleus.
The result observed
in the mustard plant,
Arabidopsis thaliana,
was that it survived
extreme heat (41°C)
in the laboratory for 8
hours. Other studies with
the mustard plant saw an
80% increase in plant
biomass.

at normal temperatures, the yield of the transgenic rice crops was 20% higher. As rice is a
staple worldwide, particularly in low-income countries, this increase in yield could help to
feed growing populations in a world of continually increasing global temperatures.

Increasing vitamin content: Golden Rice
As previously mentioned, rice plants have been
genetically modified over the past two decades. This
began in 2000, when scientists genetically engineered
rice, producing what they called Golden Rice as a way
to combat vitamin A deficiency, which kills over half a
million people each year.
This strain of rice was transgenically modified when
two genes, one from a daffodil and one from the
bacterium Pantoea ananatis, were inserted. The genes
result in the production of beta-carotene, which gives
the rice its distinctive yellow colour (hence the name
Golden Rice). Beta-carotene is also found in carrots,
Figure 3C–5 Comparison of GMO Golden Rice with
‘normal’ or standard rice
and when consumed by humans it is converted into
vitamin A. As rice is a relatively cheap staple food, especially in developing countries, this
transgenically modified (TMO) rice helps to reduce the number of people suffering from
vitamin A deficiency. The added advantage of Golden Rice is that research has proved that
these crops are unlikely to cross-pollinate unmodified crops, as rice crops usually self-
pollinate. And, unlike many other modified crops, the seeds can be re-planted season after
season, making it relatively cheap for farmers.

Improving disease resistance
Effect of fungus on wheat production
A disease known as wheat scab, caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum, has a huge
impact on the production of wheat and barley. The disease causes the grain to shrivel and
reduces the yield of these plants. The fungus also releases a toxin that remains in grain
destined for food consumption. If this toxin is in high concentrations, it can harm humans
and animals. Therefore, in many countries, these infected grains must be discarded.

which causes wheat scab. It can affect single (left) or multiple

As you will learn in Section 6B, fungal infections can be treated by spraying the plants
with chemicals, known as fungicides. However, the pathogen infects plants during winter,
meaning that rain can wash the fungicide away.
Scientists discovered a gene, called Fhb7, in a wild species related to wheat. This gene codes
for an enzyme, glutathione S-transferase, which is able to destroy trichothecenes (toxins
released by the fungus). This allows the continual reproduction of wheat that has Fusarium
resistance. The Fhb7 gene was thought to have originated from a fungus that normally lives
inside wild wheatgrass but does not cause disease, as the plant and the fungus exist together
in a mutual symbiotic relationship. At some point, the fungal DNA managed to combine
with the wheatgrass DNA, and is now incorporated into the wheatgrass genome. As you
learned in Section 3B, it is normally bacteria that are associated with the transfer of genes
between species of animals and plants – this was one of few examples of a fungus taking
this role.
Experiments highlighted the fact that adding the Fhb7 gene to wheat did not have any
negative effects on the grain’s yield and provided the wheat with some resistance to
fungal toxins.

Implications of genetically modifying plants
Below are outlined the types of implications, and examples of each, that need to be
considered when genetically modifying plants for increased crop productivity and/or
improved resistance to disease.
Ethical implications
Some of the major ethical implications raised by the use of GMOs
and TMOs are listed below. Note that most of these are negative
implications.
• Many individuals or groups consider the manipulation of any
organism’s genetic information to be unnatural.
• Is the consumption of genetically modified (GM) plants safe
for humans? Has there been enough research to prove whether
there are short- or long-term impacts on an individual’s health?
• If cross-pollination occurs between GM crops and non-GM
crops growing nearby, then the farmers of the non-GM crops
cannot claim that their crops are GM free. Also, the patents for
those GM crops could be owned by companies.
• Large biotechnology companies generally control the
production and distribution of GM seeds. Some GM seeds
become unviable (that is, they will not germinate) after just
one generation, which means farmers have to continually
re-purchase seeds, which can be expensive. Therefore,
although the rewards of increased crop yield and reduced
disease are potentially great, much of the farmer’s profit is
Figure 3C–8 A farmer in the United States
fills his planter with GM corn seed.
spent on buying new seeds year after year. This can be even
more expensive if large conglomerate companies decide to increase their own profit by
raising the price of seeds. This specifically has a link to social implications.

Social/economic implications
Remember from Section 3B that social implications
are those that have an impact on not only one or
two individuals but a greater proportion of society.
Some of the major social implications (both positive
and negative) of the use of GMOs and TMOs
are listed below. Note that many of these social
implications can be linked closely to economic
implications.
• Large companies that own the patents for
GM seeds control the market and the cost
of the seeds, and not all farmers can afford
this technology. This increases the inequality
between wealthier and poorer struggling farmers.
Those who are able to afford the GM seeds
initially can grow more crops, sell more and earn
more profit to buy seeds again in future seasons.
• The reduced need to use pesticides due to GM
crops’ improved resistance to disease could put
manufacturers of these products out of business because of reduced sales.
Figure 3C–9 Protesters tear up GM canola plants in 2002 at
a demonstration against GM crops at a farm in England. The
farm is being used as a government test bed for GM crops,
which the protesters say will pollute the environment with
GM pollen. Eighty protesters trespassed on the farm and tore
up the plants, before being arrested.

116 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
• Improved crop yield for plants such as rice and wheat could help to reduce malnutrition
and hunger, especially in low-income countries. As was seen with Golden Rice, GM food
with improved nutritional value may lead to a reduction in deficiencies (like vitamin A
deficiency), resulting in healthier populations.
• Plants that have been genetically modified to grow in harsher conditions due to climate
change could also help to reduce malnutrition in some countries.
• Giving consumers a choice as to whether they buy GM foods is becoming increasingly
important. (For example, the organic food industry has become very big in Western
countries.) This makes correct labelling of products as ‘GM’ or ‘GM free’ crucial, and has
been legislated in Australia.
Biological implications
Any unnatural (or natural) change to an organism’s genetic material that changes the way
it behaves has the potential to affect other living organisms in the same ecosystem. These
effects can be positive or negative. Some of the biological implications of GMO and TMO
plants are listed below.
• As GM crops can result in increased growth and yield of plants, less space is required for
growth. This means less land is cleared for farming, which reduces the loss of habitat for
other organisms.
• A reduction in the use of insecticides or pesticides means less of these chemicals flowing
into rivers and streams, and therefore less impact on aquatic life or other organisms that
drink this water (including humans, in some countries).
• Increased planting of GM crops could lead to loss of biodiversity, as the genomes
of GM crops are identical (or very similar). If selection pressures such as disease or
environmental changes occur, the lack of variation in the plant species could mean a
drastically reduced survival rate for the crop, resulting in shortages in the food supply for
a community or population.
• The genes from GM crops could be inadvertently transferred to another plant of the
same (or very similar) species that is not GM, via cross-pollination caused by insects or
wind. This links back to the ethical implications mentioned previously.
NOTE
It is important to be aware that much of the work in genetic modification has been conducted on,
and is established with, animals. This includes the benefits of the production of increased supply
of food (e.g. milk) and resources (e.g. wool). This is not covered in this text, as the curriculum only
requires you to focus on genetically modified organisms relating to increased agricultural yield
and improved resistance to disease (plants).

Should we grow GM crops?
by Mary Nugyen
More than 25 years after genetically modified (GM) food first appeared, growing
GM crops remains a hotly debated topic. Some people argue that GM crops are
the only way to feed the growing world population and to minimise environmental
harm. Other people express different views.
Bt cotton is a type of cotton that contains two genes from a soil bacterium, Bacillus
thuringiensis, enabling it to produce insect-resistant proteins. Australian farmers of
Bt cotton use only 15% of the quantity of the insecticide that was once needed to
protect their cotton crops. However, Bt cotton is not as resistant to the main insect
pest of cotton crops, Helicoverpa, as it has been in the past.
In Australia, Bt cotton is picked by machine, but in India, it is picked by hand.
Workers in India have developed skin allergies, which have been attributed to Bt
cotton proteins.
Traditionally, farmers have saved money by keeping seed from one year’s crop
to plant the following year. However, it is illegal for farmers to keep Bt cotton
seeds because these seeds have been declared the legal property of the company
Monsanto. Every year, cotton farmers must buy more seeds from Monsanto.
Unlike Monsanto, the company that produces the GM food crop Golden Rice
allows farmers to replant the rice they harvested the previous year. By inserting a
gene from the bacterium Erwinia uredovora and another from a daffodil, Narcissus
pseudonarcissus, into white rice, scientists produced Golden Rice – a rice variety
containing higher levels of vitamin A. People who eat Golden Rice avoid vitamin A
deficiency. Trials conducted in several countries have shown that Golden Rice is safe
to eat.
Here is a question that followed this information.

Using information from the article, complete the table below by describing one social

Gene editing to improve adaptability
The ability to change an organism’s DNA through genetic modification (as discussed
in Section 3C) could be of huge benefit to the international fishery industry. These
changes could allow the Australian fishery industry to avoid time-consuming and costly
GM regulations as set by the country’s jurisdictions, because the slight DNA changes
involved result in variations that could occur naturally within a population. As you will
see in Section 9B, this variation in a species could make it more adaptable to changes in
selection pressures, such as disease or drought. This would allow the industry to plan
productively for a world experiencing rapid climate change and growing population.
One of the newest forms of gene editing technology is CRISPR-Cas9, which targets
a specific location on a gene and inserts, deletes or replaces DNA at this location.
One possible application of this method is to make fish, like salmon, sterile so that
they do not spend energy reproducing and instead use their energy for rapid growth.
This technology could also be broadened to include environmental productivity, by
engineering plants to provide fish with a suitable array of nutrients, enabling further
growth. This technology could allow food industries such as fisheries to keep up with
growing population demand.

EXPLAIN
Previous methods of genetic engineering
The first genome editing techniques were developed
towards the end of the 1900s. For many years, the
main technique used viruses as a way of inserting
DNA into cells or rectifying ‘mistakes’ in the DNA
of an individual. This was called gene therapy.
However, this technique was imprecise, and so there
were issues associated with it. The main concern was
that there was no control over where the DNA was
inserted. For example, it could enter in the middle of
Figure 3D–2 Gene delivery using a
viral vector to transfer DNA into a

another gene in the DNA of the recipient organism
and subsequently disrupt the normal code for making that gene’s protein. That could have
dire consequences for the survival of the organism.
The ‘evolution’ of genetic engineering – CRISPR-Cas9
In 2009, a pattern of DNA now known as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeat) was discovered in bacteria, and its use as a gene editing tool began.
Breaking down the full name of CRISPR may help you to understand what it is.
• Clustered – positioned close together
• Regularly – present at particular intervals
• Interspaced – the repeated sequences have non-repeating spacers between them
• Short – measuring a small distance from end to end
• Palindromic – a word, or in this case a sequence, that reads the same forwards as it
does backwards
• Repeat – present more than once.
Therefore, CRISPR is a small sequence of a few nucleotides in DNA that is the same
forwards and backwards, repeated one after the other with spacers in between, close
together in regular intervals in a genome.
The role of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria
These sequences of DNA were discovered in E. coli bacteria in 1987. However, it was not
until 2007 that their role in defence against bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria)
was determined. CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to edit DNA in various organisms, including
humans, since around 2012.
CRISPR is a group of nucleotides that codes for short sequences of RNA. A CRISPR-
associated enzyme, called Cas9, is able to cut at a specific region of the DNA, determined by
sequences of RNA, called guide RNA (gRNA). Each gRNA contains 20 nucleotides that are
able to bind to a complementary sequence of a strand of DNA nucleotides after it unwinds
the DNA. The endonuclease, Cas9, has a recognition site for a 3-nucleotide sequence
called the PAM sequence and two active sites able to cut both strands of DNA at the sugar–
phosphate backbone, like a restriction enzyme would. The PAM sequence is not naturally
present in bacteria but is in bacteriophage viruses that insert their genome into bacteria.
Cas9 will only cut if it recognises the PAM sequence; therefore, the latter plays an essential
role in distinguishing self from non-self for bacteria.
At this point, the cell’s natural DNA repair mechanisms do one or both of the following:
• adding nucleotides that alter the sequence of DNA
• inserting a short region of DNA with a specific nucleotide sequence.

In bacteria, cutting up viral genetic material ensures that the virus can no longer replicate
and damage the bacteria. (You will learn about viruses in Section 6C.) The Cas9 enzyme
can include regions of the viral DNA by inserting them as the spacers into the CRISPR
sequence, so the bacteria have a memory of past infections by the same virus. The CRISPR
nucleotide sequence is also passed on to daughter bacterial cells when the bacteria
reproduce by binary fission, so they also have a memory of the virus.
To use the bacteria-derived CRISPR-Cas9 tool to cut the genome of an organism, single
guide RNA is created with a sequence complementary to the target of the cut, which is
adjacent to a PAM sequence. The sgRNA and Cas9 recognise the PAM sequence, enabling
the right cut to be made (Figure 3D–3).

The future of CRISPR-Cas9
The development of the
CRISPR-Cas9 system means
that the gRNA nucleotides can
be built artificially. Therefore, a
scientist can essentially design a
sequence to match any specific
sequence of nucleotides in DNA
and control where in another
organism’s DNA the Cas9
enzyme will cut. Unlike the use
of viruses for gene editing, as
described earlier, this technique
allows genetic engineers to
remove a faulty allele (version
of a gene) and insert a normal
functioning allele with extreme
precision, thereby giving the
organism a therapeutic benefit.

Other potential uses of CRISPR-Cas9
When scientists discovered the advantages of CRISPR, including that the process is cheap,
easy and accurate, they soon discovered how it could be reprogrammed to edit the genomes
of different species. Research in manipulating the role of CRISPR-Cas9 has included the
following breakthroughs:
• One of the two active sites of the Cas9 enzyme can be deactivated and new enzymes
added. The Cas9 then transports these enzymes to a specific DNA sequence. This means
scientists can alter a single nucleotide, so an allele that causes a disorder can be removed,
LINK
or a nucleotide that results in a stop codon being produced in mRNA transcribed from
2B THE GENETIC
CODE AND GENE
EXPRESSION
that DNA can be introduced.
• Adding transcription activators that attach
to either the Cas9 enzyme or the gRNA
and encourage RNA polymerase to
bind more readily to the DNA results
in an increased rate of transcription.
Alternatively, a gene can be silenced
by incorporating more factors that
block the action of RNA polymerase in
transcription.
• Fluorescent proteins can be added to
the Cas9, which allows scientists to
locate a specific gene in an organism’s
genome and/or follow this gene and the
chromosome it is on through cell division.
• Several diseases can be treated, including
editing cancer genes and potential for
removing HIV genes from sufferers.

The function of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria is immune defence against genes that viruses
inject into them to express as proteins and reproduce. A nucleotide sequence from the
virus is incorporated into the bacterium’s CRISPR sequence as a ‘memory’, so the next
time that virus is encountered, the bacterium produces gRNA, which directs Cas9 to cut
the viral gene up into pieces.
This function can be applied to genome editing in live cells in the laboratory, through
the following steps and diagram:
1 Guide RNA is created to
match the desired gene
sequence to be edited.
2 This gRNA, along with
Cas9, is injected into
the cell.
3 When the guide RNA binds
to its target gene sequence,
the active sites of the Cas9
enzyme make a precise cut
in the organism’s DNA.
4 The cell’s own DNA repair
enzymes repair the break.
5 Scientists can manipulate
the repair enzymes to
delete or disrupt the gene
at the repair site, thereby
preventing a harmful gene
from being expressed.
Or they can insert a
new sequence of DNA
nucleotides to change
a detrimental allele to a
beneficial one.

3D THE FUTURE OF GENOME EDITING
125
It is highly unlikely that an examination question would ask you to recall the steps of the
action of CRISPR-Cas9, although an internal school assessment may.
Here is an example of a question on the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in editing an organism’s
genome:
Question:
What is the advantage of using CRISPR-Cas9 over other DNA tools that are able to
cut the DNA, like restriction enzymes?
Answer:
CRISPR-Cas9 uses guide RNA (gRNA) that can be artificially designed to bind with
a specific sequence of nucleotides, enabling Cas9 to cut the DNA at a precise point,
whereas restriction enzymes cannot be guided in the same way and will cut DNA
at a recognition site that may occur anywhere along the strand. Also, gRNA is 20
nucleotides long, compared to a recognition site, which is only 4–6 nucleotides long.
So the gRNA is likely to find only one complementary site in the whole genome,
whereas there are likely to be many restriction enzyme recognition sites. The gRNA
is more specific in where it allows the Cas9 enzyme to cut the DNA, as opposed to a
restriction enzyme.
If you look back at the steps of the action of CRISPR-Cas9 above, step 3 discusses the
action of the enzyme Cas9. Other questions relating to enzyme structure and function,
the role of the active sites, what they bind to (substrate) and the specificity of these
enzymes could also be asked. Enzymes are discussed in Section 4A.
Additionally, questions about transcription (Section 2B) or mutations (Section 9A) could
also relate to this concept. Therefore, it is important to use the concept maps provided at
the beginning of each chapter and your own developed concept maps across the entire
curriculum to find as many links between content as possible. The links to other chapters
throughout each section of this book should assist you with this.

sequence of the target gene in order to use CRISPR-Cas9.
4 Outline one difference between the function of a restriction enzyme and that of
CRISPR-Cas9.
5 The gRNA is longer than a recognition site for restriction enzymes. What is the
advantage of this for the Cas9 enzyme compared to a restriction enzyme?
6 Identify two possible reasons why scientists would want to use CRISPR-Cas9 technology.

13 A transgenically modified species of Bt cotton exists where two genes from the bacterium
Bacillus thuringiensis have been inserted into the cotton crop’s genome. These two genes code
for proteins that are lethal to a caterpillar that feeds on the plant, by disrupting its digestive
system. For farmers in Australia, this has reduced reliance on pesticides, which greatly reduces
the environmental impact of pesticide use, on other organisms. It has also reduced the amount
spent on pesticides by farmers. However, it is illegal for farmers to re-plant the Bt cotton seeds
in successive seasons, due to legal declarations established by the biotechnology company
that sells them to farmers. The seeds are the property of this company. The long-term cost of
buying seeds each year could be more than the farmers save on pesticides.

 At a football game, a mother and father accidently became separated from their son.
Coincidently, on the same day two other families also lost sight of their sons. At the end of the
match, the first couple in question located the security station at the ground to collect their
son. However, the security staff wanted to be 100% sure about which of the three children
actually belonged to the parents. For this reason, they decided to bring in the police and their
forensic science team to perform a DNA profile of each parent and the three lost children.
They investigated one region of DNA and compared the size of the DNA fragments in this
region on each of their two chromosomes containing this gene (In this hypothetical scenario
the children are biologically related to their parents). The results are shown below, for the sizes
of those DNA fragments.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can explain what genetic screening is and give examples of disorders it can detect
CODE: 3B.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
Genetic screening is a form of DNA profiling used to analyse an individual's DNA for a particular allele associated with a disorder. It can be conducted on adults (carrier testing), on a foetus (prenatal testing), or on newborns (postnatal testing).

WHY (importance):
Genetic screening allows early detection and treatment of genetic disorders, but also raises significant ethical questions about how the information should be used.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Prenatal genetic screening can detect conditions such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Huntington disease, and thalassaemia. Postnatal screening of newborns can detect phenylketonuria (PKU), allowing immediate dietary changes that prevent intellectual disability.

SUBTOPIC: DNA Profiling and Genetic Screening
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers DNA profiling using variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), interpreting gel electrophoresis results for profiling, genetic screening for inherited disorders, and the ethical, social, economic and biological implications of these technologies.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: DNA profiling is one of the most important real-world applications of DNA manipulation techniques. Understanding how VNTRs are used to identify individuals, and being able to interpret gel results, connects molecular tools to forensic science, paternity testing and genetic counselling.

TOPIC: DNA Manipulation Techniques and Their Applications
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The use of molecular tools to manipulate DNA, including restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, PCR and gel electrophoresis, and their applications in DNA profiling, gene cloning for insulin production, genetically modified organisms, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.

ENGAGE
Forensic science on TV
As you may have seen in crime dramas like CSI or NCIS, the investigators are able to
obtain DNA samples from a crime scene, get them back to the lab and have a result
all within a few hours. Often, they carry out a number of DNA techniques to help
solve a crime, within a 40-minute episode. In reality, even though the same methods
are used, the process is much slower. Some of the DNA analysis tools explored in
this section, such as
restriction enzymes,
gel electrophoresis
and the polymerase
chain reaction, take
many hours to run. In
addition to the time
that these methods
take, prior analysis and
preparation of materials
are required. The TV
versions also do not
account for the fact that
some techniques need
to be run one after the
other, in order to obtain
meaningful results.

The importance of DNA
DNA is a macromolecule that is passed from pre-existing cells to new cells. In this way,
offspring inherit their DNA from their parent(s). As you learned in Section 2B, each cell of
an organism contains the entire complement of the organism’s DNA, also known as their
genome. This chapter focuses on applying your knowledge of the structure and function of
DNA and how different molecular tools can be used to manipulate this DNA.

Molecular tools
Restriction enzymes
Restriction enzymes (also known as restriction endonucleases) are proteins that act like
molecular scissors, cutting the sugar–phosphate backbone of DNA at a specific region,
known as a recognition (restriction) site (Figure 3A–2).

may make cuts at different places on the two chains.
PPS
Restriction enzymes occur naturally in bacteria (some are also found in viruses, archaea and
eukaryotes), where they serve the same ‘scissor-like’ purpose but for a defence mechanism.
They cut the DNA of a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria, shown in Figure 3A–3)
into fragments. The bacterium’s own DNA is protected from these restriction enzymes by
chemical modification and enzymes that modify the bacterial DNA so it is not recognised
by the restriction enzyme, or by simply not having the recognition site in the first place.

Differences between restriction enzymes
There are more than 3000 different restriction enzymes, with only around 600 of these
commercially available to scientists. Each restriction enzyme recognises a specific
recognition site in the DNA. Restriction enzymes are therefore named based on the
following international guidelines:
• abbreviation, in letters, of the name of the bacterium in which they are naturally found
• Roman numerals after the letters to classify the specific enzyme from the same
bacterium (as usually there is more than one).
As an example, HaeIII is the third endonuclease isolated from the bacterium Haemophilus
aegyptius. Table 3A–1 shows HaeIII and four other restriction enzymes, to highlight the
differences between them.

ENDONUCLEASES
Note the red arrows in column two of Table 3A–1. These indicate the location in the
sugar–phosphate backbone where the specific restriction enzyme digests (cuts) the DNA.
This location within the recognition site determines whether the fragments of DNA
produced from this will result in sticky ends or blunt ends (shown in columns three and
four). Note also that each recognition site is usually 4–6 base pairs long and is a palindrome.
This means they read the same in a 5′ (5 prime) to 3′ (3 prime) direction on the template
strand as they do on the coding strand, remembering that the two strands of DNA run in
opposite directions, as you learned in Section 2A.
For example, in EcoRI (in Table 3A–1), the coding strand reads GAATTC and the template
strand reads GAATTC, if looking at both from the 5′ end first.

DNA ligase
In genetic engineering, sometimes two fragments of DNA need to be joined. This is
essentially the reverse effect of restriction enzymes, which digest DNA. To join fragments
of DNA, an enzyme is required, as is the case for most processes that occur within the
body. This enzyme is called DNA ligase . Its role is to catalyse the joining of pieces of double-
stranded DNA at their sugar–phosphate backbone. This joining of fragments of DNA can
create a longer linear strand of DNA, or even a circular DNA molecule. It can also join
fragments of DNA from different species. These techniques are explored in Section 3B. DNA ligase

Figure 3A–4 DNA ligase acts as a ‘glue’ that joins two fragments of DNA together at the sugar–
phosphate backbone.
The types of ends matter for DNA ligase
As you will recall, blunt end fragments of DNA are produced when the restriction enzyme
cuts straight across the sugar–phosphate backbone of both DNA strands. As they have no
overhanging nucleotides, DNA ligase is able to join them with any other fragment of DNA
that also has a blunt end, though with more difficulty than when there are overhangs. This
is random and not overly specific.
Sticky end fragments are produced when the restriction enzyme cuts between the same
pair of nucleotides in the palindromic recognition site on each strand of DNA. This
results in overhanging nucleotides that DNA ligase can only join to another fragment
of DNA containing complementary overhanging nucleotides. If not, the overhanging
nucleotides would not form complementary base pairs due to hydrogen bonding between
the nitrogenous bases A and T, and C and G, as you learned in Section 2A. Therefore,
this fragment must also have been cut with the same restriction enzyme (shown in
Figure 3A–4 ), making sticky ends of DNA more specific than blunt ends.

Polymerase chain reaction
In order to work effectively with DNA, it is necessary to have more than a single copy or a
few copies of it. Therefore, a simple method is needed to amplify the DNA to produce large
quantities in a short amount of time. This method is called the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). As you will see later in this section, PCR is particularly useful for forensic scientists to
amplify certain regions of the DNA from traces of blood found at a crime scene.
The polymerase chain reaction uses a mixture of ingredients that are heated and cooled
in cycles. After each cycle, the number of copies of the DNA is doubled. At the beginning
of the process, the ingredients are added to a microtube, which is then placed in a
thermocycler (a machine that acts as a heating block to rapidly change the temperature for
each stage). The stages of the cycle are outlined in Table 3A–2.

PCR is an extremely sensitive process. Any contamination in the original DNA template or
mistake made in a cycle means the same mistake will be copied over and over again through
each cycle. Therefore, for this process to work effectively, great care is required in the
preparation of samples and the regulation of temperature.

ELECTROPHORESIS
DOC
Gel electrophoresis
Biologists usually work with large amounts of DNA and long strands of DNA. This means
that when a sample of DNA is mixed with restriction enzyme(s), fragments of differing
lengths are produced. Often, biologists are only interested in one section of this DNA and
so they need to isolate the relevant fragment. This is made even more difficult because
DNA is too small to see and is colourless. This is where gel electrophoresis proves valuable.
The basic process of gel electrophoresis is as follows:
1 Digested samples containing the DNA fragments and a dye are loaded into wells at one
end of an agarose gel.
2 The gel is covered in a solution containing ions, which allows the movement of DNA
fragments when an electric field is applied to the gel through a negative electrode at the
well end and a positive electrode at the other end. DNA is negatively charged due to the
phosphate groups.
3 The negatively charged DNA migrates from the wells at the negative electrode of the gel
towards the positive electrode. DNA from each well stays in the ‘lane’ running from each
well. The DNA fragments separate according to their size and the charge they carry.
Smaller DNA fragments travel faster (and therefore further) than larger fragments.
4 The dye in the samples travels faster than the DNA and, when the ‘dye front’ (its
position) reaches the positive electrode, the power is turned off and the gel plate is
removed for analysis.
5 At the end, when the agarose gel has been removed, a different dye that attaches to DNA
can be added and this reveals where the DNA fragments are.

NOTE
All DNA fragments of the same size in a sample will migrate to the same distance from the well
and end up at the same point in that lane. The particular fragment that a scientist is seeking can
then be cut out from the gel and used in experiments.
The reason for adding ‘loading’ dye to the sample at the beginning is that DNA is colourless
and during the ‘run’ the operator can’t see how far it has moved. This allows a scientist to
determine the time at which to stop the gel electrophoresis process, and therefore the time
at which the DNA fragments have had the longest to separate. The ‘invisibility’ of the DNA
is also the reason for using a different dye to reveal it on the agarose gel. Dyes that fluoresce
under ultraviolet light can also be attached to the DNA. The glowing patches can then be
digitally photographed for analysis.
The importance of a control
In gel electrophoresis, conditions can vary each time a gel is run. These conditions include the:
• voltage of the power source
• percentage of agarose in the gel (agarose is a polysaccharide added to the gel to control
the rate at which fragments move through the gel)
• concentration of the solution (a ‘buffer’) covering the agarose gel
• temperature of the environment
• pH of the buffer solution
• length of time the sample of DNA is allowed to run for in the gel
• length of the gel (distance between the negative and positive electrodes).
As such, the distance that particular-sized fragments of DNA will migrate through the
gel will not be the same every time. This means scientists cannot use something as simple
as a ruler to measure the distance
bp
travelled by a fragment of DNA to
determine its size.
10 000
One lane in the gel must always
be used to run a control. In gel
electrophoresis, this is called a DNA
standard , or DNA ladder. A DNA
standard is a DNA sample that has
been digested with a particular
restriction enzyme that produces
many different-sized fragments
of DNA with known lengths.
These DNA standards are usually
purchased and come with a pictorial
representation of the fragments
expected to be seen on a gel and
their respective sizes, usually in base
pairs (bp) or kilo base pairs (kbp).
This allows the scientist to compare
the sizes of the fragments in their
DNA sample to the fragments with
known size from the DNA standard
( Figure 3A–7 ).

The end result
The result of gel electrophoresis is a series of parallel bands of DNA fragments at different
distances along the gel. The sizes of these unknown fragments are determined by
comparing them to the sizes of known fragments of DNA in the DNA standard.

Applying knowledge of DNA structure to restriction enzymes
Recall from Section 2A that the structure of DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is
different. In prokaryotes the DNA is circular, whereas in eukaryotes the DNA is linear.
This has a huge impact on the number of fragments that can be produced from digestion
with restriction enzymes. It also means that reading the question correctly is crucial.
For example:
Question:
In this linear piece of DNA, the restriction enzyme BglII has two recognition sites.
How many fragments would be produced?
BglII BglII
740 kbp
Answer:
Three
However, if the question was worded slightly differently, a different answer would be
required. For example:
Question:
The following DNA taken from a prokaryote was digested with the restriction
enzyme BglII, which has two recognition sites. How many fragments would be
produced?
BglII BglII
740 kbp

The key to reading this question is to understand that DNA from prokaryotic cells is
circular. Even though the figure shows linear DNA, it is there to test whether you have
read the question carefully and understand the differences between different types of
cells. The parts of each question marked in yellow above are examples of what would be
good for you to highlight or underline as you are reading through the question.
Use of a heat-resistant DNA polymerase in PCR
The DNA polymerase used for PCR comes from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus
aquaticus, which has evolved to live in extremely hot environments. As such, the optimal
temperature for its enzymes is approximately 72°C. As the optimal temperature for this
enzyme is so high, it is not denatured (three-dimensional functional shape permanently
altered – more on this in Section 4B) even when heating to temperatures above 90°C.
As you can imagine, this is very different to the optimal temperature of the same DNA
polymerase enzymes typically found in humans and other animals, which have an
optimal temperature of 37°C.
Questions will be along the lines of: ‘Why can’t human DNA polymerase be used in the
PCR process?’. The answer to this is as explained above, and it means you need to be
able to apply your understanding of different concepts across topics. You should always
provide a comparison in this case between the two, and reference to the specific stage
that would affect the enzyme here.

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics
The traditional method of producing insulin for treating diabetes involved extracting
insulin from the pancreas of pigs and cows. A problem with this technique was that
some people developed antibodies against animal insulin, which made it ineffective.
Insulin is now produced by recombinant DNA techniques, in which the human
insulin-producing gene is inserted into bacteria.

Pig pancreas Insulin extracted Insulin purified, pasteurised and bottled
Figure 3B–1 Insulin was originally taken from the pancreas of pigs and cows.
However, bacteria can transfer plasmids (circular rings of DNA) between each other and
also to different species of bacteria. For this reason there has been some trepidation on
the part of scientists in using bacteria to make copies of human genes. Their concerns
centre on the fact that, even though these bacteria are modified in strict isolation and
under tightly controlled conditions, the process may inadvertently create a strain of
genetically modified bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.
As you will see in this section, in the process of gene cloning, the use of antibiotic-
resistance genes in plasmids to identify bacteria with the inserted human genes is
gradually being replaced by the use of enzymes that make fluorescent substances.
The most common example, which you can do in the school laboratory, is using an
enzyme from jellyfish that produces a green fluorescent protein (GFP). As the name
suggests, these jellyfish fluoresce green when exposed to UV light. In the same way that
the gene of interest would be inserted into the plasmid, the gene for GFP is inserted,
thereby avoiding the need to use antibiotic resistance genes.

The application of DNA manipulation techniques
DNA profiling
The main use of the process of gel electrophoresis, which you studied in Section 3A, in
forensic science is in DNA profiling, or DNA fingerprinting.
In DNA profiling, analysts need to find unique patterns that will identify an individual.
Regions of DNA that code for certain proteins or enzymes are not useful for DNA profiling,
because they code for products or functions that are the same in everyone. So analysts
instead study stretches of non-coding regions of DNA. These are called ‘short tandem
repeats’ (STRs) if they are 2–6 base pairs long, or variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs)
if they are longer, typically 20–60 base pairs. The number of repeats can vary between
individuals. If only one region was focused on, the number of repeats of the sequence
could be the same in two individuals. Therefore, in humans, 13 of these VNTR regions are
studied in DNA profiling, so the chance of two individuals having exactly the same number
of nucleotide repeats at each location would be very low. In fact, only identical twins have
the same VNTRs at each region. Each individual has some VNTRs (and STRs) that come
from their parents. The VNTRs can be inherited from either the mother or the father and
can be a combination of both. An individual’s VNTRs will never have sequences that are
not present in their parents. Each individual has two copies of each VNTR, because they
are alleles, one from each pair of homologous chromosomes (chromosomes of the same size,
centromere and banding pattern from the mother and father).

nucleotide sequence GATTC. One chromosome is inherited from the mother and the other from
the father.
Therefore, VNTRs can be used to identify a criminal from biological evidence found at a
crime scene, or to identify the father of a child in a paternity test. The steps in this process
are as follows:
1 DNA is extracted from the cells obtained from an individual (e.g. blood, semen or hair
from a crime scene).
2 The DNA of the 13 different VNTR regions (or a set number of these) is amplified by
PCR.
3 The DNA is cut with specific restriction enzymes (or multiple restriction enzymes) that
have recognition sites at either side of the VNTR regions.
4 The DNA fragments are loaded into wells on agarose gel and separated by gel
electrophoresis.
Smaller alleles, or nucleotide sequences of DNA, have fewer repeats of the short sequence
and will therefore migrate faster and further through the agarose gel than larger alleles with
more repeats. This is shown in Figure 3B–3.

PPS
In addition to forensic scientists using DNA profiling to identify the perpetrator of a crime,
or geneticists using it to determine a paternal parent, this technique can be used to:
• identify victims following a mass disaster
• identify human or animal fossils that can provide information about possible
evolutionary links
• develop a DNA database of wildlife. If there are only a few bands that differ between
individuals, indicating little genetic diversity, conservation measures can be
implemented to maximise that species’ chances of survival. Hence, breeding programs
could be initiated by zoos where genetically different individuals are bred to increase the
genetic diversity of the species.

Genetic screening
Genetic screening is a form of DNA profiling used to analyse an individual’s DNA for
a particular version of a gene (allele) they might be carrying. Genetic screening can be
conducted on adults when they suspect they may be carrying an allele for a disorder they
could pass onto their offspring. It can also be conducted on a foetus to test for the presence
of a disorder (prenatal testing) or on a newborn baby (postnatal testing). It is used to
identify cases where a baby may develop disorders such as those listed in Table 3B–1.
Many other common medical conditions can be detected as part of postnatal testing,
including phenylketonuria (PKU) and hypothyroidism. The benefit of screening for these
conditions is that it allows immediate treatment and/or changes in lifestyle to reduce the
negative effects of the condition.

Implications of DNA analysis technologies: overview
In selecting a DNA analysis/application technique to use, scientists need to consider the
ethical, social, economic and biological implications of that technology. It is also important
to identify the stakeholder and how the technology is likely to affect them, directly or
indirectly. The stakeholder is anyone (or an organisation) who will be affected by the
technology. Table 3B–2 outlines these implications.
Table 3B–2 Ethical, social, economic and biological implications of DNA analysis technology
Implication Definition Relation to stakeholder
Ethical A sense of right or wrong
in producing or obtaining
the technology, based on
morals and beliefs
The decision to engage with a technology will depend on the
individual’s personal ethical considerations.
Conducting scientific research involving humans or animals (e.g.
drug trials) requires approval by an ethics committee.
Social The influence of the
technology on society,
rather than just one or
two individuals
An individual’s decision making is influenced by the context
they are in. For example, different countries, or even different
communities within the same country, have different attitudes about
what is socially acceptable in regards to different technologies.
Government legislation is also different from country to country.
Economic The availability of funds
to obtain or produce the
technology
The cost of developing and using some technologies can be
prohibitive, and so they may not be equally accessible to all.
It is also important to consider who is funding the technology. For
example, results might be biased by emphasising positive outcomes
and downplaying negative outcomes.
Biological The effect of a
technology on other living
organisms in a particular
environment
The use of some technologies can affect the survival of other
organisms within an ecosystem. It may also change the course of
evolution, for better or worse.
The questions raised about these issues, and their answers, will depend on their context
and which stakeholder’s viewpoint is being considered. This is discussed further in the
3B Skills section.

Implications of DNA profiling and genetic screening
Ethical
DOC
Essentially, ethics deal with questions of right or wrong, or ‘Should I or shouldn’t I?’ In the case
of DNA profiling and genetic screening, some examples of questions to be dealt with are:
• Informed consent for DNA sampling – this is an issue
for children under the age of 18 years, who at the time
of having a DNA sample collected rely on parents to
provide consent on their behalf.
• Secure storage of DNA information – who has access to
this information and what would happen if it fell into the
wrong hands? For example, could insurance companies
make it difficult or costly for an individual to obtain
health or life insurance if they were identified as having a
genetic predisposition to developing a disease?
• Reliability of DNA analysis results as evidence of a foetus
having a genetically inherited disorder – if a foetus is
identified as having the genetic potential to develop
a particular disorder, the parents are then faced with
Figure 3B–4 Parents being counselled on results
of genetic testing and their likelihood of having a
child with a genetic disorder
the decision of whether to abort the foetus. Different
governments have their own regulations concerning this.
An example of the third point is a couple finding out that they might both be carriers of
the allele for Huntington disease. This is a late-onset condition that might not become
apparent until after they have a child. Would they want to know before having a child, if
their offspring could develop the condition? Would this change their own quality of life?
Remember, they might not develop the disease.

AND
IMPLICATIONS
Social
Social implications refer to the impact of the technology on more than one or two
individuals. For DNA profiling and genetic screening, some examples of questions to be
addressed are:
• The possibility of incorrect identification of a suspect from a sample of DNA obtained
from a crime scene – this could be caused by contamination of DNA. This would not
only affect the individual who has been wrongfully accused, as well as their partner
and/or immediate family, but would also have implications for the judicial system as a
whole (fairness/justice). So the question is: Is it right to convict a person based solely on
DNA evidence?
• Privacy of the information obtained from a DNA profile or genetic screen – for example,
what would the implications be for society if a DNA profile was held of every person,
even those not convicted of a crime? In Victoria, a DNA sample cannot be obtained
from a person unless they give permission. This gives the person the opportunity to
know beforehand the risks associated with storage of the information and, if digital
results are hacked or compromised, who might access their personal DNA information.
• Information about the possibility of inheriting a genetic disease – intending parents
might be faced with difficult reproductive decisions. This could be heightened
depending on whether they are planning to have a child or are already pregnant. They
could be faced with the ethical implications of choosing to terminate a pregnancy. This
could place strain on their relationship, and they might seek professional counselling.
• People who have a genetic predisposition to certain conditions may find they are
discriminated against by employers, insurers or other bodies.

Economic
Economic considerations refer to the cost implications of the technology – how it affects
individuals directly, as well as others in the community. For DNA profiling and genetic
screening, an example of questions to be addressed is:
• Expense of treatment – if a couple was informed of the risk of their potential offspring
inheriting a genetic disorder, their decision about whether to undergo IVF must include
the cost of treatment, as IVF is expensive. If the couple chose not to have a child, this
would avoid the expense not only for themselves, but for society, of providing the
medical and educational support that would be required for an affected child.
Biological
Biological implications can affect not only the organism in question, but more than one
organism or species. For DNA profiling and genetic screening, an example of questions
raised is:
• Altering the affected genome – for some inherited disorders, it may be possible to
correct the mutation that causes the condition, using gene editing. (This also raises
ethical issues.) The biological implications could be very significant for humans. For
example, gene editing can be seen as ‘interfering’ with evolution, by altering the future
inheritance of traits (alleles), some of which may disappear from the population.

Gene cloning
The universal nature of DNA
DNA is universal, but what does this mean? ‘Universal’ refers to the fact that the basic
structure of DNA is the same in every organism. The building blocks (monomers) you
learned about in Section 2A are identical in structure. The nitrogenous bases (adenine,
cytosine, guanine and thymine, and their complementarity) that make up part of these
monomers are identical. In essence this means that the DNA of one species can be
combined with the DNA of a different species, using a range of DNA manipulation
techniques, which were explored in Section 3A.
 Nowadays, genetic engineers can create genes, and
even complete genomes for some species, by using
artificial nucleotides in a laboratory setting. They
can work backwards from the desired final protein
sequence, by looking at the specific chain of amino
acids, identifying mRNA codons that code for these
and then using stored computer software to synthesise
the DNA nucleotides. This built sequence of DNA can
then be inserted directly into a plasmid (circular piece
of DNA in prokaryotes), all without the need for a
physical DNA template.

The gene cloning process combines the use of a plasmid with some of the DNA manipulation
techniques outlined in Section 3A. The key steps of this process in relation to inserting
the human insulin gene into bacteria for insulin protein production, which is vital in the
treatment of type I diabetes (T1D), are outlined in Figure 3B–8. If you studied Unit 1
Biology, you will already know that this disorder results from the cells that produce insulin,
beta cells in the pancreas, being targeted for destruction by the immune system. This is
known as an autoimmune disease. You will learn more about these types of diseases in
Section 7D.
Insulin is a vital protein-based hormone, responsible for controlling blood glucose levels by
reducing the concentration of blood glucose when it becomes too high. The process of gene
cloning (outlined in Figure 3B–8) is a way of mass-producing insulin for people with T1D.

100 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
Cloning the human insulin genes for treating type I diabetes
Two genes express the two distinct polypeptide chains that form human insulin. Steps 1-6 are done twice, once for
each gene, in different bacterial cultures. The two polypeptide chains are combined in Step 7 to form insulin.
Step 1: Opening up the plasmid
 Plasmid is cut with the specific restriction enzyme. This makes the initially circular DNA temporarily linear.
Antibiotic
resistance gene
Restriction
enzyme cuts ‘Sticky’ ends
Plasmid from bacteria In this example, the enzyme
produces sticky ends
Step 2: Isolating the gene of interest
Gene of interest (the DNA coding for the insulin protein) is cut using a specific restriction enzyme.
Insulin gene
Restriction enzymes Any introns in this area are
also removed in this step
Insulin gene
Sticky end Sticky end
If the restriction enzyme in step 1 was one that resulted in ‘sticky end’ fragments, then the same restriction
enzyme must be used to cut the gene of interest as well. The ‘sticky ends’ must be complementary.
If the restriction enzyme was one that resulted in ‘blunt end’ fragments, any other blunt end restriction enzyme
may be used.
Step 3: Recombinant plasmids
The plasmid and gene of interest and β-galactosidase gene are mixed together with the enzyme DNA ligase which
joins them with phosphodiester bonds. This results in a closed circular piece of DNA again. This is called the
recombinant plasmid, as it has ‘recombined’ with a piece of foreign DNA.

Note: At this step it is common for the circular plasmid to re-join to itself with the help of DNA ligase, therefore
without taking up the gene of interest. This is referred to as a non-recombinant plasmid. The β-galactosidase
gene is taken up in recombinant plasmids as a marker for them, detected by a simple test.

done for exactly the right time and at the correct temperature, then no transformation occurs.

Step 5: Bacteria reproduce
Bacterial reproduction (binary fission) results in
clones forming that are genetically identical to the
parent cell (this process occurs every 20 minutes,
doubling the number of cells each time – and
the number of plasmids increases even more,
as they replicate independently of the bacterial
reproduction). The insulin and marker genes are
expressed, producing fused insulin polypeptide
and β-galactosidase protein in every bacterial cell.

Step 6: Identifying bacteria with the recombinant plasmid
The traditional method of doing
this step is to use the antibiotic
resistance genes found naturally in
plasmids as a way of locating the
transformed bacteria (those that
have taken up the recombinant
plasmid) from untransformed
bacteria (those that have not taken
up the recombinant plasmid).
Transformed
bacteria
Nutrient
agar plate Bacteria plated on medium
with antibiotic
The bacteria are spread onto a
nutrient agar plate containing an antibiotic . Only those transformed bacteria that contain
the gene for antibiotic resistance are able to survive. Untransformed bacteria, which have
no plasmid, and therefore no antibiotic resistance gene, do not survive in this environment.
However, there are ethical concerns about using this technique. As the bacteria are able
to transfer plasmids between each other, and even to other species of bacteria (bacterial
conjugation), it is possible that this may result in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, possibly creating a ‘superbug’.
Another method of identifying bacteria with the recombinant plasmid is a test for the β-galactosidase protein made
by the marker gene. As in this example, the two methods may be used together.
Antibiotic
a substance that inhibits
the growth of bacteria;
an example is penicillin
Step 7: Extracting, purifying and combining the insulin polypeptides
Steps 1-6 have been performed twice in separate bacterial cultures to
produce a polypeptide from each of the two insulin genes. The two types
of polypeptide are separated from the β-galactosidase protein, purified,
and then combined together to produce functional insulin, ready to

Implications of gene cloning
Ethical
The use of bacteria for gene cloning has overcome the ethical and animal welfare issues
associated with extracting proteins, like insulin, from animals such as pigs and cattle, or
from the cells of human donors. However, some people view the transfer of genes from one
species to another as unethical, regardless of the overall benefit it could provide to society.
Social
There are many advantages of gene cloning for society, including:
• reduced cost of therapeutics made with bacteria, providing greater access to treatments
for more individuals in the community
• the creation of employment opportunities in the biotechnology industry, as well as
marketing and sales of these products.
A potential disadvantage of gene cloning is its misuse for non-therapeutic purposes, such as
creating performance-enhancing drugs, giving athletes an unfair advantage in competitions.
Economic
An economic advantage of using bacteria for gene cloning is that it has made the
production of therapeutics, like insulin for diabetics, relatively cheap – large quantities can
be produced, with a reliable (constant) supply. However, it is still important to note that
this benefit depends on the country and the socioeconomic background of the individual.
Biological
Inserting human genes into plasmids, creating a recombinant plasmid, and performing
genetic transformation to make copies of proteins to give to patients, provides a purer or
more effective product than using proteins purified from animals. This has made new and
safer treatments for disorders and the development of vaccines possible. It also reduces the
chances of side effects or of transmitting diseases. The use of vaccines reduces the number
of deaths from diseases, and this contributes to an increase in the average life expectancy
of the population. This results in the birth rate increasing more than the death rate, and
the increase in the world’s population increases the strain on the environment and affects
other species that share our ecosystems. In the long term, this changes the course of natural
selection and our evolution.
The risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (superbugs) developing has already been outlined.
Such a development would be very difficult to overcome. This is covered in more detail in
Section 9C.

Gene cloning over PCR?
Through all the steps of gene cloning, you might have asked, ‘Why doesn’t the scientist just
isolate the insulin gene of interest and then use PCR to amplify this section of DNA?’
The answer is threefold.
1 While PCR makes copies of DNA, genetic engineers need to know that this insulin
gene can be converted into a fully functioning protein. For this to occur, there must
be a set-up in which protein synthesis can take place, and this requires the different
types of RNA and ribosomes that you learned about in Section 2C.
2 Bacteria reproduce by binary fission every 20 minutes – this means that every
20 minutes, the number of bacteria doubles. Even within this time, plasmids replicate
independently of the bacteria. Therefore, even more plasmids, and therefore copies of
the insulin gene, can be produced in every reproductive cell cycle.
3 PCR requires a number of expensive ingredients: samples of the four nucleotides, a
heat-resistant enzyme, and forward and reverse primers. In comparison, the use of
restriction enzymes and bacteria, like E. coli, is inexpensive.
Determining whether transformed bacteria have taken up the recombinant or
non-recombinant plasmid
The advantage of plasmids is that they usually contain, or can be constructed to contain,
genes that code for antibiotic resistance. This gives bacteria with that plasmid a survival
advantage in the presence of the antibiotic that they have resistance to.
Common examination questions in this topic involve how the transformed bacteria are
identified. To determine which bacteria are transformed, the bacteria are grown on agar
nutrient plates containing an antibiotic (e.g. ampicillin). The recombinant plasmid that
has been taken up by transformed bacteria has a gene for resistance. It is important to
recall here that it is also possible for transformed bacteria that contain a non-recombinant
plasmid (without the gene of interest) to survive, as they still contain the antibiotic-
resistance gene. This is shown in Figure 3B–9.

104 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
Figure 3 B–9 shows that three types of bacteria are possible after genetic transformation:
• containing no plasmid (very common)
• containing the non-recombinant plasmid
• containing the recombinant plasmid.
If all three types of bacteria are grown on an agar plate containing antibiotic, both types
of transformed bacteria will survive and reproduce. So how can a scientist work out
which bacteria contain the recombinant plasmid and which contain the non-recombinant
plasmid?
Hopefully you have worked out that the plasmids could be isolated from the bacteria
and run on gel electrophoresis. Th e recombinant plasmids with the foreign DNA inserted
should be larger than the non-recombinant plasmids without the foreign DNA. Th is is
shown in Figure 3 B–10.

Answering questions about ethical and social implications
As mentioned in this chapter, when discussing the implications of gene cloning, it is
crucial to identify the stakeholder. Th e following question from the 2019 VCAA Biology
exam highlights this.

Question:
The Genomics Health Futures Mission will run a $32 million trial, starting in 2019, to
screen over 10 000 couples who are in early pregnancy or who are planning to have a
baby. Using a blood test, individuals will be screened for over 500 severe or deadly
gene mutations.
Couples will be told they have a genetic mutation if both individuals in the couple
carry the same mutation. The trial may lead to a population-wide carrier screening
program. The researchers will evaluate cost effectiveness, psychological impact, ethics
and barriers to screening. It is anticipated that future tests will be free of charge.
The test may find that a couple who were planning to have a baby or who were
already pregnant both carry the same severe or deadly mutation.
Describe one ethical and one social issue/implication that could arise from this finding.
For this question, the stakeholder is the couple. Many answers would focus on the child
as the stakeholder or the future impact on the child, but the question clearly asks for the
implication that arises from this finding. The table below shows answers that would be
acceptable or not acceptable, for each implication.
Answer:
Ethical:
Acceptable answers Unacceptable answers
Possible termination of the foetus Child is given up for adoption.
(Wrong, as the couple is only planning or
already pregnant but have not had the child)
Should a severely affected child,
who may suffer, be born?
The child may live a poor-quality life.
(Again, the child is not born yet)
Should alternative reproductive
therapies (like IVF) be accessed?
Issues for the child in knowing they have the
gene for the disease, as they did not give
consent for the test.
(Wrong, as this is not directly related to the
parents finding out this information.)
Who else has access to the
information from this finding?
What if insurance companies refuse to provide
life insurance to this individual in the future, if
they carry this disease-related gene?
(Wrong, as the gene in question would cause
health effects in the child, not the parents.)

It is important to practise answering these types of questions. Examples of questions
from the perspective of different stakeholders are provided at the end of this section and
in the chapter review and digital questions.
Linking ideas in a sequential nature
When answering questions, you should do so in a sequential way, although this isn’t
always easy. It can require you to change the way you think about what is happening.
Answering questions in this way helps the examiner see what you are thinking, and to
identify that you know your content and are able to link ideas together.
Let’s look at how to approach a question of this nature.
Question:
Explain the different types of enzymes used in the process of gene cloning. (2 marks)
Answer:
• To open up the plasmid and isolate the foreign DNA from an organism, the
strands need to be cut with restriction enzymes. These are enzymes that identify a
specific recognition site and cut the DNA at the sugar–phosphate backbone of the
two strands.
• For the plasmid and foreign DNA to be joined together, they may need to be cut
with the same restriction enzyme that produces complementary sticky ends.
• To join the two pieces of DNA together, the enzyme DNA ligase is used. This
enzyme works in the opposite way to a restriction enzyme, as a ‘glue’ joining
nucleotides at the sugar–phosphate backbone.

ENGAGE
The evolution of genetically modified organisms
Genetic modification really took off in 1973 when two scientists, Stanley Cohen and
Herbert Boyer, successfully removed an antibiotic resistance gene from one species of
bacteria (donor) and placed it into another species of bacteria (recipient). The recipient
bacteria then demonstrated antibiotic resistance.
You might think this is where the story begins, but humans have actually been ‘modifying’
organisms for thousands of years. As far back as 30 000 BC, humans were changing the
DNA of a particular species through the process of selective breeding, also referred to as
artificial selection, which you will learn more about in Chapter 9. What was this species? It
is one you are familiar with, if you look around when you go for a walk, watch TV or visit
a pet store: dogs! Our ancestors domesticated wild wolves in Eastern Asia and selectively
bred individuals to produce offspring that were initially more passive and compliant.
From there, and over thousands of
years, everything from hair length,
body shape and size, to colour, has
been selected for, resulting in the
many breeds that exist today. The
difference between selective breeding
and the current method of genetic
modification is that the process is
now much faster and does not require
many generations to pass before
change is noticeable.
With the rise of genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) and the
accompanying interest in them,
various stakeholders have expressed
their concerns about the implications,
for our own health and, more broadly,
that of the world’s ecosystems. As a
result, regulation of experiments and
appropriate safety measures have been
established for researchers, who also
educate others in the broader scientific
community about the significance of
their findings.

EXPLAIN
Genetically modified vs transgenically modified organisms
As discussed in Section 3B, genetic engineering involves the transfer of DNA from one
organism to another, resulting in recombinant DNA. If the recipient organism has had its
own genome modified (e.g. genes being switched on or off), or contains DNA from a donor
of the same species, then it is referred to as a genetically modified organism (GMO). However,
if the recipient organism contains DNA from a different species, then it is referred to as
a transgenically modified organism (TMO) (trans = across, genic = gene), or transgenic. The
bacteria used in the process of gene cloning for the human insulin gene (in Section 3B)
would be referred to as both genetically modified (their DNA has been manipulated) and
transgenic (they contain human DNA).

Increasing crop productivity
Making photosynthesis more efficient
When plants undergo photosynthesis, the process is not 100% efficient, as you will learn
in Section 5E. The process generates by-products that are damaging to the cellular
components that convert light into chemical energy, and increasing global temperatures are
causing this to occur more regularly.
Normally when chlorophyll in the grana of chloroplasts absorbs light, water is split,
creating oxygen, hydrogen ions and electrons. The electrons help to power photosynthesis.
However, heat can damage a key protein, D1, involved in this process. As such, scientists
have genetically modified plants, such as the mustard plant, tobacco and rice, to better
repair the damage caused by heat.
As you learned in Section 2B, DNA codes for proteins. In plant cells, DNA is located in
the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Chloroplast DNA codes for proteins that are
used by the chloroplast, like the D1 protein that is affected by heat. The issue with the
chloroplast DNA is that it is much harder to modify than nuclear DNA. Scientists have
removed the gene coding for this protein using restriction enzymes, combined it with a
section of DNA that is activated during ‘heat stress’ and moved it into the nucleus.
The result observed
in the mustard plant,
Arabidopsis thaliana,
was that it survived
extreme heat (41°C)
in the laboratory for 8
hours. Other studies with
the mustard plant saw an
80% increase in plant
biomass.

consecutive days. The transgenic crops yielded 8–10% more grain than normal plants. Even
at normal temperatures, the yield of the transgenic rice crops was 20% higher. As rice is a
staple worldwide, particularly in low-income countries, this increase in yield could help to
feed growing populations in a world of continually increasing global temperatures.

Increasing vitamin content: Golden Rice
As previously mentioned, rice plants have been
genetically modified over the past two decades. This
began in 2000, when scientists genetically engineered
rice, producing what they called Golden Rice as a way
to combat vitamin A deficiency, which kills over half a
million people each year.
This strain of rice was transgenically modified when
two genes, one from a daffodil and one from the
bacterium Pantoea ananatis, were inserted. The genes
result in the production of beta-carotene, which gives
the rice its distinctive yellow colour (hence the name
Golden Rice). Beta-carotene is also found in carrots,
Figure 3C–5 Comparison of GMO Golden Rice with
‘normal’ or standard rice
and when consumed by humans it is converted into
vitamin A. As rice is a relatively cheap staple food, especially in developing countries, this
transgenically modified (TMO) rice helps to reduce the number of people suffering from
vitamin A deficiency. The added advantage of Golden Rice is that research has proved that
these crops are unlikely to cross-pollinate unmodified crops, as rice crops usually self-
pollinate. And, unlike many other modified crops, the seeds can be re-planted season after
season, making it relatively cheap for farmers.

The United Nations predicts that, by 2050, the world will need to produce 70% more food
than it currently does, in order to feed the growing global population. This is a vital reason
to continue using genetic engineering to increase crop yields.
Improving disease resistance
Effect of fungus on wheat production
A disease known as wheat scab, caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum, has a huge
impact on the production of wheat and barley. The disease causes the grain to shrivel and
reduces the yield of these plants. The fungus also releases a toxin that remains in grain
destined for food consumption. If this toxin is in high concentrations, it can harm humans
and animals. Therefore, in many countries, these infected grains must be discarded.

which causes wheat scab. It can affect single (left) or multiple
spikelets (centre), or the entire head (right) of the wheat.
As you will learn in Section 6B, fungal infections can be treated by spraying the plants
with chemicals, known as fungicides. However, the pathogen infects plants during winter,
meaning that rain can wash the fungicide away.
Scientists discovered a gene, called Fhb7, in a wild species related to wheat. This gene codes
for an enzyme, glutathione S-transferase, which is able to destroy trichothecenes (toxins
released by the fungus). This allows the continual reproduction of wheat that has Fusarium
resistance. The Fhb7 gene was thought to have originated from a fungus that normally lives
inside wild wheatgrass but does not cause disease, as the plant and the fungus exist together
in a mutual symbiotic relationship. At some point, the fungal DNA managed to combine
with the wheatgrass DNA, and is now incorporated into the wheatgrass genome. As you
learned in Section 3B, it is normally bacteria that are associated with the transfer of genes
between species of animals and plants – this was one of few examples of a fungus taking
this role.
Experiments highlighted the fact that adding the Fhb7 gene to wheat did not have any
negative effects on the grain’s yield and provided the wheat with some resistance to
fungal toxins.

Implications of genetically modifying plants
Below are outlined the types of implications, and examples of each, that need to be
considered when genetically modifying plants for increased crop productivity and/or
improved resistance to disease.
Ethical implications
Some of the major ethical implications raised by the use of GMOs
and TMOs are listed below. Note that most of these are negative
implications.
• Many individuals or groups consider the manipulation of any
organism’s genetic information to be unnatural.
• Is the consumption of genetically modified (GM) plants safe
for humans? Has there been enough research to prove whether
there are short- or long-term impacts on an individual’s health?
• If cross-pollination occurs between GM crops and non-GM
crops growing nearby, then the farmers of the non-GM crops
cannot claim that their crops are GM free. Also, the patents for
those GM crops could be owned by companies.
• Large biotechnology companies generally control the
production and distribution of GM seeds. Some GM seeds
become unviable (that is, they will not germinate) after just
one generation, which means farmers have to continually
re-purchase seeds, which can be expensive. Therefore,
although the rewards of increased crop yield and reduced
disease are potentially great, much of the farmer’s profit is
Figure 3C–8 A farmer in the United States
fills his planter with GM corn seed.
spent on buying new seeds year after year. This can be even
more expensive if large conglomerate companies decide to increase their own profit by
raising the price of seeds. This specifically has a link to social implications.

Social/economic implications
Remember from Section 3B that social implications
are those that have an impact on not only one or
two individuals but a greater proportion of society.
Some of the major social implications (both positive
and negative) of the use of GMOs and TMOs
are listed below. Note that many of these social
implications can be linked closely to economic
implications.
• Large companies that own the patents for
GM seeds control the market and the cost
of the seeds, and not all farmers can afford
this technology. This increases the inequality
between wealthier and poorer struggling farmers.
Those who are able to afford the GM seeds
initially can grow more crops, sell more and earn
more profit to buy seeds again in future seasons.
• The reduced need to use pesticides due to GM
crops’ improved resistance to disease could put
manufacturers of these products out of business because of reduced sales.
Figure 3C–9 Protesters tear up GM canola plants in 2002 at
a demonstration against GM crops at a farm in England. The
farm is being used as a government test bed for GM crops,
which the protesters say will pollute the environment with
GM pollen. Eighty protesters trespassed on the farm and tore
up the plants, before being arrested.

116 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
• Improved crop yield for plants such as rice and wheat could help to reduce malnutrition
and hunger, especially in low-income countries. As was seen with Golden Rice, GM food
with improved nutritional value may lead to a reduction in deficiencies (like vitamin A
deficiency), resulting in healthier populations.
• Plants that have been genetically modified to grow in harsher conditions due to climate
change could also help to reduce malnutrition in some countries.
• Giving consumers a choice as to whether they buy GM foods is becoming increasingly
important. (For example, the organic food industry has become very big in Western
countries.) This makes correct labelling of products as ‘GM’ or ‘GM free’ crucial, and has
been legislated in Australia.
Biological implications
Any unnatural (or natural) change to an organism’s genetic material that changes the way
it behaves has the potential to affect other living organisms in the same ecosystem. These
effects can be positive or negative. Some of the biological implications of GMO and TMO
plants are listed below.
• As GM crops can result in increased growth and yield of plants, less space is required for
growth. This means less land is cleared for farming, which reduces the loss of habitat for
other organisms.
• A reduction in the use of insecticides or pesticides means less of these chemicals flowing
into rivers and streams, and therefore less impact on aquatic life or other organisms that
drink this water (including humans, in some countries).
• Increased planting of GM crops could lead to loss of biodiversity, as the genomes
of GM crops are identical (or very similar). If selection pressures such as disease or
environmental changes occur, the lack of variation in the plant species could mean a
drastically reduced survival rate for the crop, resulting in shortages in the food supply for
a community or population.
• The genes from GM crops could be inadvertently transferred to another plant of the
same (or very similar) species that is not GM, via cross-pollination caused by insects or
wind. This links back to the ethical implications mentioned previously.
NOTE
It is important to be aware that much of the work in genetic modification has been conducted on,
and is established with, animals. This includes the benefits of the production of increased supply
of food (e.g. milk) and resources (e.g. wool). This is not covered in this text, as the curriculum only
requires you to focus on genetically modified organisms relating to increased agricultural yield
and improved resistance to disease (plants).

Should we grow GM crops?
by Mary Nugyen
More than 25 years after genetically modified (GM) food first appeared, growing
GM crops remains a hotly debated topic. Some people argue that GM crops are
the only way to feed the growing world population and to minimise environmental
harm. Other people express different views.
Bt cotton is a type of cotton that contains two genes from a soil bacterium, Bacillus
thuringiensis, enabling it to produce insect-resistant proteins. Australian farmers of
Bt cotton use only 15% of the quantity of the insecticide that was once needed to
protect their cotton crops. However, Bt cotton is not as resistant to the main insect
pest of cotton crops, Helicoverpa, as it has been in the past.
In Australia, Bt cotton is picked by machine, but in India, it is picked by hand.
Workers in India have developed skin allergies, which have been attributed to Bt
cotton proteins.
Traditionally, farmers have saved money by keeping seed from one year’s crop
to plant the following year. However, it is illegal for farmers to keep Bt cotton
seeds because these seeds have been declared the legal property of the company
Monsanto. Every year, cotton farmers must buy more seeds from Monsanto.
Unlike Monsanto, the company that produces the GM food crop Golden Rice
allows farmers to replant the rice they harvested the previous year. By inserting a
gene from the bacterium Erwinia uredovora and another from a daffodil, Narcissus
pseudonarcissus, into white rice, scientists produced Golden Rice – a rice variety
containing higher levels of vitamin A. People who eat Golden Rice avoid vitamin A
deficiency. Trials conducted in several countries have shown that Golden Rice is safe
to eat.
Here is a question that followed this information.
Question:
Using information from the article, complete the table below by describing one social

same implication should not be used twice.

Gene editing to improve adaptability
The ability to change an organism’s DNA through genetic modification (as discussed
in Section 3C) could be of huge benefit to the international fishery industry. These
changes could allow the Australian fishery industry to avoid time-consuming and costly
GM regulations as set by the country’s jurisdictions, because the slight DNA changes
involved result in variations that could occur naturally within a population. As you will
see in Section 9B, this variation in a species could make it more adaptable to changes in
selection pressures, such as disease or drought. This would allow the industry to plan
productively for a world experiencing rapid climate change and growing population.
One of the newest forms of gene editing technology is CRISPR-Cas9, which targets
a specific location on a gene and inserts, deletes or replaces DNA at this location.
One possible application of this method is to make fish, like salmon, sterile so that
they do not spend energy reproducing and instead use their energy for rapid growth.
This technology could also be broadened to include environmental productivity, by
engineering plants to provide fish with a suitable array of nutrients, enabling further
growth. This technology could allow food industries such as fisheries to keep up with
growing population demand.

3D The futuRE of GENoME EDITING
121
EXPLAIN
Previous methods of genetic engineering
The first genome editing techniques were developed
towards the end of the 1900s. For many years, the
main technique used viruses as a way of inserting
DNA into cells or rectifying ‘mistakes’ in the DNA
of an individual. This was called gene therapy.
However, this technique was imprecise, and so there
were issues associated with it. The main concern was
that there was no control over where the DNA was
inserted. For example, it could enter in the middle of
Figure 3D–2 Gene delivery using a
viral vector to transfer DNA into a

another gene in the DNA of the recipient organism
and subsequently disrupt the normal code for making that gene’s protein. That could have
dire consequences for the survival of the organism.
The ‘evolution’ of genetic engineering – CRISPR-Cas9
In 2009, a pattern of DNA now known as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeat) was discovered in bacteria, and its use as a gene editing tool began.
Breaking down the full name of CRISPR may help you to understand what it is.
• Clustered – positioned close together
• Regularly – present at particular intervals
• Interspaced – the repeated sequences have non-repeating spacers between them
• Short – measuring a small distance from end to end
• Palindromic – a word, or in this case a sequence, that reads the same forwards as it
does backwards
• Repeat – present more than once.
Therefore, CRISPR is a small sequence of a few nucleotides in DNA that is the same
forwards and backwards, repeated one after the other with spacers in between, close
together in regular intervals in a genome.
The role of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria
These sequences of DNA were discovered in E. coli bacteria in 1987. However, it was not
until 2007 that their role in defence against bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria)
was determined. CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to edit DNA in various organisms, including
humans, since around 2012.
CRISPR is a group of nucleotides that codes for short sequences of RNA. A CRISPR-
associated enzyme, called Cas9, is able to cut at a specific region of the DNA, determined by
sequences of RNA, called guide RNA (gRNA). Each gRNA contains 20 nucleotides that are
able to bind to a complementary sequence of a strand of DNA nucleotides after it unwinds
the DNA. The endonuclease, Cas9, has a recognition site for a 3-nucleotide sequence
called the PAM sequence and two active sites able to cut both strands of DNA at the sugar–
phosphate backbone, like a restriction enzyme would. The PAM sequence is not naturally
present in bacteria but is in bacteriophage viruses that insert their genome into bacteria.
Cas9 will only cut if it recognises the PAM sequence; therefore, the latter plays an essential
role in distinguishing self from non-self for bacteria.
At this point, the cell’s natural DNA repair mechanisms do one or both of the following:
• adding nucleotides that alter the sequence of DNA
• inserting a short region of DNA with a specific nucleotide sequence.

In bacteria, cutting up viral genetic material ensures that the virus can no longer replicate
and damage the bacteria. (You will learn about viruses in Section 6C.) The Cas9 enzyme
can include regions of the viral DNA by inserting them as the spacers into the CRISPR
sequence, so the bacteria have a memory of past infections by the same virus. The CRISPR
nucleotide sequence is also passed on to daughter bacterial cells when the bacteria
reproduce by binary fission, so they also have a memory of the virus.
To use the bacteria-derived CRISPR-Cas9 tool to cut the genome of an organism, single
guide RNA is created with a sequence complementary to the target of the cut, which is
adjacent to a PAM sequence. The sgRNA and Cas9 recognise the PAM sequence, enabling
the right cut to be made (Figure 3D–3).

The future of CRISPR-Cas9
The development of the
CRISPR-Cas9 system means
that the gRNA nucleotides can
be built artificially. Therefore, a
scientist can essentially design a
sequence to match any specific
sequence of nucleotides in DNA
and control where in another
organism’s DNA the Cas9
enzyme will cut. Unlike the use
of viruses for gene editing, as
described earlier, this technique
allows genetic engineers to
remove a faulty allele (version
of a gene) and insert a normal
functioning allele with extreme
precision, thereby giving the
organism a therapeutic benefit.

Other potential uses of CRISPR-Cas9
When scientists discovered the advantages of CRISPR, including that the process is cheap,
easy and accurate, they soon discovered how it could be reprogrammed to edit the genomes
of different species. Research in manipulating the role of CRISPR-Cas9 has included the
following breakthroughs:
• One of the two active sites of the Cas9 enzyme can be deactivated and new enzymes
added. The Cas9 then transports these enzymes to a specific DNA sequence. This means
scientists can alter a single nucleotide, so an allele that causes a disorder can be removed,
LINK
or a nucleotide that results in a stop codon being produced in mRNA transcribed from

CODE AND GENE
EXPRESSION
that DNA can be introduced.
• Adding transcription activators that attach
to either the Cas9 enzyme or the gRNA
and encourage RNA polymerase to
bind more readily to the DNA results
in an increased rate of transcription.
Alternatively, a gene can be silenced
by incorporating more factors that
block the action of RNA polymerase in
transcription.
• Fluorescent proteins can be added to
the Cas9, which allows scientists to
locate a specific gene in an organism’s
genome and/or follow this gene and the
chromosome it is on through cell division.
• Several diseases can be treated, including
editing cancer genes and potential for
removing HIV genes from sufferers.

Questions about CRISPR-Cas9
The use of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome editing tool is new content in the current Study
Design. The Study Design states that students need to know:
The function of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria and the application of this function in editing
an organism’s genome
The function of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria is immune defence against genes that viruses
inject into them to express as proteins and reproduce. A nucleotide sequence from the
virus is incorporated into the bacterium’s CRISPR sequence as a ‘memory’, so the next
time that virus is encountered, the bacterium produces gRNA, which directs Cas9 to cut
the viral gene up into pieces.
This function can be applied to genome editing in live cells in the laboratory, through
the following steps and diagram:
1 Guide RNA is created to
match the desired gene
sequence to be edited.
2 This gRNA, along with
Cas9, is injected into
the cell.
3 When the guide RNA binds
to its target gene sequence,
the active sites of the Cas9
enzyme make a precise cut
in the organism’s DNA.
4 The cell’s own DNA repair
enzymes repair the break.
5 Scientists can manipulate
the repair enzymes to
delete or disrupt the gene
at the repair site, thereby
preventing a harmful gene
from being expressed.
Or they can insert a

nucleotides to change
a detrimental allele to a

3D THE FUTURE OF GENOME EDITING
125
It is highly unlikely that an examination question would ask you to recall the steps of the
action of CRISPR-Cas9, although an internal school assessment may.
Here is an example of a question on the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in editing an organism’s
genome:
Question:
What is the advantage of using CRISPR-Cas9 over other DNA tools that are able to
cut the DNA, like restriction enzymes?
Answer:
CRISPR-Cas9 uses guide RNA (gRNA) that can be artificially designed to bind with
a specific sequence of nucleotides, enabling Cas9 to cut the DNA at a precise point,
whereas restriction enzymes cannot be guided in the same way and will cut DNA
at a recognition site that may occur anywhere along the strand. Also, gRNA is 20
nucleotides long, compared to a recognition site, which is only 4–6 nucleotides long.
So the gRNA is likely to find only one complementary site in the whole genome,
whereas there are likely to be many restriction enzyme recognition sites. The gRNA
is more specific in where it allows the Cas9 enzyme to cut the DNA, as opposed to a
restriction enzyme.
If you look back at the steps of the action of CRISPR-Cas9 above, step 3 discusses the
action of the enzyme Cas9. Other questions relating to enzyme structure and function,
the role of the active sites, what they bind to (substrate) and the specificity of these
enzymes could also be asked. Enzymes are discussed in Section 4A.
Additionally, questions about transcription (Section 2B) or mutations (Section 9A) could
also relate to this concept. Therefore, it is important to use the concept maps provided at
the beginning of each chapter and your own developed concept maps across the entire
curriculum to find as many links between content as possible. The links to other chapters

13 A transgenically modified species of Bt cotton exists where two genes from the bacterium
Bacillus thuringiensis have been inserted into the cotton crop’s genome. These two genes code
for proteins that are lethal to a caterpillar that feeds on the plant, by disrupting its digestive
system. For farmers in Australia, this has reduced reliance on pesticides, which greatly reduces
the environmental impact of pesticide use, on other organisms. It has also reduced the amount
spent on pesticides by farmers. However, it is illegal for farmers to re-plant the Bt cotton seeds
in successive seasons, due to legal declarations established by the biotechnology company
that sells them to farmers. The seeds are the property of this company. The long-term cost of
buying seeds each year could be more than the farmers save on pesticides.
a What would be the likely type of vector used to insert the genes from the bacteria into the
cotton crop’s genome? (1 mark)
b Is Bt cotton a TMO or a GMO? Explain your answer. (1 mark)

DNA profiling is a technique used to analyse the DNA similarities and differences between
both related and unrelated individuals for the purpose of investigations.
a What is the name of the regions of DNA that DNA profiling typically focuses on? (1 mark)
 At a football game, a mother and father accidently became separated from their son.
Coincidently, on the same day two other families also lost sight of their sons. At the end of the
match, the first couple in question located the security station at the ground to collect their
son. However, the security staff wanted to be 100% sure about which of the three children
actually belonged to the parents. For this reason, they decided to bring in the police and their
forensic science team to perform a DNA profile of each parent and the three lost children.
They investigated one region of DNA and compared the size of the DNA fragments in this
region on each of their two chromosomes containing this gene (In this hypothetical scenario
the children are biologically related to their parents). The results are shown below, for the sizes
of those DNA fragments.
DNA region Mother 3, 8 Father Lost child 1 Lost child 2 Lost child 3
‘X’ 6, 10 3, 6 10, 13 8, 10
b From these results, identify which lost child belongs to these parents. Explain your answer.
 (2 marks)
c Based on your answer to part b and your knowledge of DNA profiling, what should the
forensic scientists have done differently? (1 mark)
d The method used to generate results in this test was digital. Another technique that could
have been used to identify these different-sized fragments of DNA was gel electrophoresis.
Draw a fully labelled gel that includes:
• all results for individuals shown in the table above
• wells on the gel
• positive and negative electrodes, including the direction of DNA movement
• a DNA standard that results from individuals can be compared to. (4 marks)
e Explain how the technique in your answer to part d would distinguish between different-
sized fragments of DNA. In your answer, explain how the material the DNA separates on
facilitates this separation. (3 marks)

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can explain what genetic screening is and give examples of disorders it can detect
CODE: 3B.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
Genetic screening is a form of DNA profiling used to analyse an individual's DNA for a particular allele associated with a disorder. It can be conducted on adults (carrier testing), on a foetus (prenatal testing), or on newborns (postnatal testing).

WHY (importance):
Genetic screening allows early detection and treatment of genetic disorders, but also raises significant ethical questions about how the information should be used.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Prenatal genetic screening can detect conditions such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Huntington disease, and thalassaemia. Postnatal screening of newborns can detect phenylketonuria (PKU), allowing immediate dietary changes that prevent intellectual disability.

SUBTOPIC: DNA Profiling and Genetic Screening
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers DNA profiling using variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), interpreting gel electrophoresis results for profiling, genetic screening for inherited disorders, and the ethical, social, economic and biological implications of these technologies.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: DNA profiling is one of the most important real-world applications of DNA manipulation techniques. Understanding how VNTRs are used to identify individuals, and being able to interpret gel results, connects molecular tools to forensic science, paternity testing and genetic counselling.

TOPIC: DNA Manipulation Techniques and Their Applications
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The use of molecular tools to manipulate DNA, including restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, PCR and gel electrophoresis, and their applications in DNA profiling, gene cloning for insulin production, genetically modified organisms, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.

ENGAGE
Forensic science on TV
As you may have seen in crime dramas like CSI or NCIS, the investigators are able to
obtain DNA samples from a crime scene, get them back to the lab and have a result
all within a few hours. Often, they carry out a number of DNA techniques to help
solve a crime, within a 40-minute episode. In reality, even though the same methods
are used, the process is much slower. Some of the DNA analysis tools explored in
this section, such as
restriction enzymes,
gel electrophoresis
and the polymerase
chain reaction, take
many hours to run. In
addition to the time
that these methods
take, prior analysis and
preparation of materials
are required. The TV
versions also do not
account for the fact that
some techniques need
to be run one after the
other, in order to obtain
meaningful results.

The importance of DNA
DNA is a macromolecule that is passed from pre-existing cells to new cells. In this way,
offspring inherit their DNA from their parent(s). As you learned in Section 2B, each cell of
an organism contains the entire complement of the organism’s DNA, also known as their
genome. This chapter focuses on applying your knowledge of the structure and function of
DNA and how different molecular tools can be used to manipulate this DNA.

Molecular tools
Restriction enzymes
Restriction enzymes (also known as restriction endonucleases) are proteins that act like
molecular scissors, cutting the sugar–phosphate backbone of DNA at a specific region,
known as a recognition (restriction) site (Figure 3A–2).

PPS
Restriction enzymes occur naturally in bacteria (some are also found in viruses, archaea and
eukaryotes), where they serve the same ‘scissor-like’ purpose but for a defence mechanism.
They cut the DNA of a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria, shown in Figure 3A–3)
into fragments. The bacterium’s own DNA is protected from these restriction enzymes by
chemical modification and enzymes that modify the bacterial DNA so it is not recognised
by the restriction enzyme, or by simply not having the recognition site in the first place.

Differences between restriction enzymes
There are more than 3000 different restriction enzymes, with only around 600 of these
commercially available to scientists. Each restriction enzyme recognises a specific
recognition site in the DNA. Restriction enzymes are therefore named based on the
following international guidelines:
• abbreviation, in letters, of the name of the bacterium in which they are naturally found
• Roman numerals after the letters to classify the specific enzyme from the same
bacterium (as usually there is more than one).
As an example, HaeIII is the third endonuclease isolated from the bacterium Haemophilus
aegyptius. Table 3A–1 shows HaeIII and four other restriction enzymes, to highlight the
differences between them.

ENDONUCLEASES
Note the red arrows in column two of Table 3A–1. These indicate the location in the
sugar–phosphate backbone where the specific restriction enzyme digests (cuts) the DNA.
This location within the recognition site determines whether the fragments of DNA
produced from this will result in sticky ends or blunt ends (shown in columns three and
four). Note also that each recognition site is usually 4–6 base pairs long and is a palindrome.
This means they read the same in a 5′ (5 prime) to 3′ (3 prime) direction on the template
strand as they do on the coding strand, remembering that the two strands of DNA run in
opposite directions, as you learned in Section 2A.
For example, in EcoRI (in Table 3A–1), the coding strand reads GAATTC and the template
strand reads GAATTC, if looking at both from the 5′ end first.

DNA ligase
In genetic engineering, sometimes two fragments of DNA need to be joined. This is
essentially the reverse effect of restriction enzymes, which digest DNA. To join fragments
of DNA, an enzyme is required, as is the case for most processes that occur within the
body. This enzyme is called DNA ligase . Its role is to catalyse the joining of pieces of double-
stranded DNA at their sugar–phosphate backbone. This joining of fragments of DNA can
create a longer linear strand of DNA, or even a circular DNA molecule. It can also join
fragments of DNA from different species. These techniques are explored in Section 3B. DNA ligase

Figure 3A–4 DNA ligase acts as a ‘glue’ that joins two fragments of DNA together at the sugar–
phosphate backbone.
The types of ends matter for DNA ligase
As you will recall, blunt end fragments of DNA are produced when the restriction enzyme
cuts straight across the sugar–phosphate backbone of both DNA strands. As they have no
overhanging nucleotides, DNA ligase is able to join them with any other fragment of DNA
that also has a blunt end, though with more difficulty than when there are overhangs. This
is random and not overly specific.
Sticky end fragments are produced when the restriction enzyme cuts between the same
pair of nucleotides in the palindromic recognition site on each strand of DNA. This
results in overhanging nucleotides that DNA ligase can only join to another fragment
of DNA containing complementary overhanging nucleotides. If not, the overhanging
nucleotides would not form complementary base pairs due to hydrogen bonding between
the nitrogenous bases A and T, and C and G, as you learned in Section 2A. Therefore,
this fragment must also have been cut with the same restriction enzyme (shown in
Figure 3A–4 ), making sticky ends of DNA more specific than blunt ends.

Polymerase chain reaction
In order to work effectively with DNA, it is necessary to have more than a single copy or a
few copies of it. Therefore, a simple method is needed to amplify the DNA to produce large
quantities in a short amount of time. This method is called the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). As you will see later in this section, PCR is particularly useful for forensic scientists to
amplify certain regions of the DNA from traces of blood found at a crime scene.
The polymerase chain reaction uses a mixture of ingredients that are heated and cooled
in cycles. After each cycle, the number of copies of the DNA is doubled. At the beginning
of the process, the ingredients are added to a microtube, which is then placed in a
thermocycler (a machine that acts as a heating block to rapidly change the temperature for
each stage). The stages of the cycle are outlined in Table 3A–2.

PCR is an extremely sensitive process. Any contamination in the original DNA template or
mistake made in a cycle means the same mistake will be copied over and over again through
each cycle. Therefore, for this process to work effectively, great care is required in the
preparation of samples and the regulation of temperature.

ELECTROPHORESIS
DOC
Gel electrophoresis
Biologists usually work with large amounts of DNA and long strands of DNA. This means
that when a sample of DNA is mixed with restriction enzyme(s), fragments of differing
lengths are produced. Often, biologists are only interested in one section of this DNA and
so they need to isolate the relevant fragment. This is made even more difficult because
DNA is too small to see and is colourless. This is where gel electrophoresis proves valuable.
The basic process of gel electrophoresis is as follows:
1 Digested samples containing the DNA fragments and a dye are loaded into wells at one
end of an agarose gel.
2 The gel is covered in a solution containing ions, which allows the movement of DNA
fragments when an electric field is applied to the gel through a negative electrode at the
well end and a positive electrode at the other end. DNA is negatively charged due to the
phosphate groups.
3 The negatively charged DNA migrates from the wells at the negative electrode of the gel
towards the positive electrode. DNA from each well stays in the ‘lane’ running from each
well. The DNA fragments separate according to their size and the charge they carry.
Smaller DNA fragments travel faster (and therefore further) than larger fragments.
4 The dye in the samples travels faster than the DNA and, when the ‘dye front’ (its
position) reaches the positive electrode, the power is turned off and the gel plate is
removed for analysis.
5 At the end, when the agarose gel has been removed, a different dye that attaches to DNA
can be added and this reveals where the DNA fragments are.

NOTE
All DNA fragments of the same size in a sample will migrate to the same distance from the well
and end up at the same point in that lane. The particular fragment that a scientist is seeking can
then be cut out from the gel and used in experiments.
The reason for adding ‘loading’ dye to the sample at the beginning is that DNA is colourless
and during the ‘run’ the operator can’t see how far it has moved. This allows a scientist to
determine the time at which to stop the gel electrophoresis process, and therefore the time
at which the DNA fragments have had the longest to separate. The ‘invisibility’ of the DNA
is also the reason for using a different dye to reveal it on the agarose gel. Dyes that fluoresce
under ultraviolet light can also be attached to the DNA. The glowing patches can then be
digitally photographed for analysis.
The importance of a control
In gel electrophoresis, conditions can vary each time a gel is run. These conditions include the:
• voltage of the power source
• percentage of agarose in the gel (agarose is a polysaccharide added to the gel to control
the rate at which fragments move through the gel)
• concentration of the solution (a ‘buffer’) covering the agarose gel
• temperature of the environment
• pH of the buffer solution
• length of time the sample of DNA is allowed to run for in the gel
• length of the gel (distance between the negative and positive electrodes).
As such, the distance that particular-sized fragments of DNA will migrate through the
gel will not be the same every time. This means scientists cannot use something as simple
as a ruler to measure the distance
bp
travelled by a fragment of DNA to
determine its size.
10 000
One lane in the gel must always
be used to run a control. In gel
electrophoresis, this is called a DNA
standard , or DNA ladder. A DNA
standard is a DNA sample that has
been digested with a particular
restriction enzyme that produces
many different-sized fragments
of DNA with known lengths.
These DNA standards are usually
purchased and come with a pictorial
representation of the fragments
expected to be seen on a gel and
their respective sizes, usually in base
pairs (bp) or kilo base pairs (kbp).
This allows the scientist to compare
the sizes of the fragments in their
DNA sample to the fragments with
known size from the DNA standard
( Figure 3A–7 ).

The result of gel electrophoresis is a series of parallel bands of DNA fragments at different
distances along the gel. The sizes of these unknown fragments are determined by
comparing them to the sizes of known fragments of DNA in the DNA standard.

Applying knowledge of DNA structure to restriction enzymes
Recall from Section 2A that the structure of DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is
different. In prokaryotes the DNA is circular, whereas in eukaryotes the DNA is linear.
This has a huge impact on the number of fragments that can be produced from digestion
with restriction enzymes. It also means that reading the question correctly is crucial.
For example:
Question:
In this linear piece of DNA, the restriction enzyme BglII has two recognition sites.
How many fragments would be produced?
BglII BglII
740 kbp
Answer:
Three
However, if the question was worded slightly differently, a different answer would be
required. For example:
Question:
The following DNA taken from a prokaryote was digested with the restriction
enzyme BglII, which has two recognition sites. How many fragments would be
produced?
BglII BglII

The key to reading this question is to understand that DNA from prokaryotic cells is
circular. Even though the figure shows linear DNA, it is there to test whether you have
read the question carefully and understand the differences between different types of
cells. The parts of each question marked in yellow above are examples of what would be
good for you to highlight or underline as you are reading through the question.
Use of a heat-resistant DNA polymerase in PCR
The DNA polymerase used for PCR comes from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus
aquaticus, which has evolved to live in extremely hot environments. As such, the optimal
temperature for its enzymes is approximately 72°C. As the optimal temperature for this
enzyme is so high, it is not denatured (three-dimensional functional shape permanently
altered – more on this in Section 4B) even when heating to temperatures above 90°C.
As you can imagine, this is very different to the optimal temperature of the same DNA
polymerase enzymes typically found in humans and other animals, which have an
optimal temperature of 37°C.
Questions will be along the lines of: ‘Why can’t human DNA polymerase be used in the
PCR process?’. The answer to this is as explained above, and it means you need to be
able to apply your understanding of different concepts across topics. You should always
provide a comparison in this case between the two, and reference to the specific stage
that would affect the enzyme here.

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics
The traditional method of producing insulin for treating diabetes involved extracting
insulin from the pancreas of pigs and cows. A problem with this technique was that
some people developed antibodies against animal insulin, which made it ineffective.
Insulin is now produced by recombinant DNA techniques, in which the human
insulin-producing gene is inserted into bacteria.

Figure 3B–1 Insulin was originally taken from the pancreas of pigs and cows.
However, bacteria can transfer plasmids (circular rings of DNA) between each other and
also to different species of bacteria. For this reason there has been some trepidation on
the part of scientists in using bacteria to make copies of human genes. Their concerns
centre on the fact that, even though these bacteria are modified in strict isolation and
under tightly controlled conditions, the process may inadvertently create a strain of
genetically modified bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.
As you will see in this section, in the process of gene cloning, the use of antibiotic-
resistance genes in plasmids to identify bacteria with the inserted human genes is
gradually being replaced by the use of enzymes that make fluorescent substances.
The most common example, which you can do in the school laboratory, is using an
enzyme from jellyfish that produces a green fluorescent protein (GFP). As the name
suggests, these jellyfish fluoresce green when exposed to UV light. In the same way that
the gene of interest would be inserted into the plasmid, the gene for GFP is inserted,
thereby avoiding the need to use antibiotic resistance genes.

The application of DNA manipulation techniques
DNA profiling
The main use of the process of gel electrophoresis, which you studied in Section 3A, in
forensic science is in DNA profiling, or DNA fingerprinting.
In DNA profiling, analysts need to find unique patterns that will identify an individual.
Regions of DNA that code for certain proteins or enzymes are not useful for DNA profiling,
because they code for products or functions that are the same in everyone. So analysts
instead study stretches of non-coding regions of DNA. These are called ‘short tandem
repeats’ (STRs) if they are 2–6 base pairs long, or variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs)
if they are longer, typically 20–60 base pairs. The number of repeats can vary between
individuals. If only one region was focused on, the number of repeats of the sequence
could be the same in two individuals. Therefore, in humans, 13 of these VNTR regions are
studied in DNA profiling, so the chance of two individuals having exactly the same number
of nucleotide repeats at each location would be very low. In fact, only identical twins have
the same VNTRs at each region. Each individual has some VNTRs (and STRs) that come
from their parents. The VNTRs can be inherited from either the mother or the father and
can be a combination of both. An individual’s VNTRs will never have sequences that are
not present in their parents. Each individual has two copies of each VNTR, because they
are alleles, one from each pair of homologous chromosomes (chromosomes of the same size,
centromere and banding pattern from the mother and father).

nucleotide sequence GATTC. One chromosome is inherited from the mother and the other from
the father.
Therefore, VNTRs can be used to identify a criminal from biological evidence found at a
crime scene, or to identify the father of a child in a paternity test. The steps in this process
are as follows:
1 DNA is extracted from the cells obtained from an individual (e.g. blood, semen or hair
from a crime scene).
2 The DNA of the 13 different VNTR regions (or a set number of these) is amplified by
PCR.
3 The DNA is cut with specific restriction enzymes (or multiple restriction enzymes) that
have recognition sites at either side of the VNTR regions.
4 The DNA fragments are loaded into wells on agarose gel and separated by gel
electrophoresis.
Smaller alleles, or nucleotide sequences of DNA, have fewer repeats of the short sequence
and will therefore migrate faster and further through the agarose gel than larger alleles with
more repeats. This is shown in Figure 3B–3.

PPS
In addition to forensic scientists using DNA profiling to identify the perpetrator of a crime,
or geneticists using it to determine a paternal parent, this technique can be used to:
• identify victims following a mass disaster
• identify human or animal fossils that can provide information about possible
evolutionary links
• develop a DNA database of wildlife. If there are only a few bands that differ between
individuals, indicating little genetic diversity, conservation measures can be
implemented to maximise that species’ chances of survival. Hence, breeding programs
could be initiated by zoos where genetically different individuals are bred to increase the
genetic diversity of the species.

Genetic screening
Genetic screening is a form of DNA profiling used to analyse an individual’s DNA for
a particular version of a gene (allele) they might be carrying. Genetic screening can be
conducted on adults when they suspect they may be carrying an allele for a disorder they
could pass onto their offspring. It can also be conducted on a foetus to test for the presence
of a disorder (prenatal testing) or on a newborn baby (postnatal testing). It is used to
identify cases where a baby may develop disorders such as those listed in Table 3B–1.
Many other common medical conditions can be detected as part of postnatal testing,
including phenylketonuria (PKU) and hypothyroidism. The benefit of screening for these
conditions is that it allows immediate treatment and/or changes in lifestyle to reduce the
negative effects of the condition.

Implications of DNA analysis technologies: overview
In selecting a DNA analysis/application technique to use, scientists need to consider the
ethical, social, economic and biological implications of that technology. It is also important
to identify the stakeholder and how the technology is likely to affect them, directly or
indirectly. The stakeholder is anyone (or an organisation) who will be affected by the
technology. Table 3B–2 outlines these implications.
Table 3B–2 Ethical, social, economic and biological implications of DNA analysis technology
Implication Definition Relation to stakeholder
Ethical A sense of right or wrong
in producing or obtaining
the technology, based on
morals and beliefs
The decision to engage with a technology will depend on the
individual’s personal ethical considerations.
Conducting scientific research involving humans or animals (e.g.
drug trials) requires approval by an ethics committee.
Social The influence of the
technology on society,
rather than just one or
two individuals
An individual’s decision making is influenced by the context
they are in. For example, different countries, or even different
communities within the same country, have different attitudes about
what is socially acceptable in regards to different technologies.
Government legislation is also different from country to country.
Economic The availability of funds
to obtain or produce the
technology
The cost of developing and using some technologies can be
prohibitive, and so they may not be equally accessible to all.
It is also important to consider who is funding the technology. For
example, results might be biased by emphasising positive outcomes
and downplaying negative outcomes.
Biological The effect of a
technology on other living
organisms in a particular
environment
The use of some technologies can affect the survival of other
organisms within an ecosystem. It may also change the course of
evolution, for better or worse.
The questions raised about these issues, and their answers, will depend on their context
and which stakeholder’s viewpoint is being considered. This is discussed further in the
3B Skills section.

Implications of DNA profiling and genetic screening
Ethical
DOC
Essentially, ethics deal with questions of right or wrong, or ‘Should I or shouldn’t I?’ In the case
of DNA profiling and genetic screening, some examples of questions to be dealt with are:
• Informed consent for DNA sampling – this is an issue
for children under the age of 18 years, who at the time
of having a DNA sample collected rely on parents to
provide consent on their behalf.
• Secure storage of DNA information – who has access to
this information and what would happen if it fell into the
wrong hands? For example, could insurance companies
make it difficult or costly for an individual to obtain
health or life insurance if they were identified as having a
genetic predisposition to developing a disease?
• Reliability of DNA analysis results as evidence of a foetus
having a genetically inherited disorder – if a foetus is
identified as having the genetic potential to develop
a particular disorder, the parents are then faced with
Figure 3B–4 Parents being counselled on results
of genetic testing and their likelihood of having a
child with a genetic disorder
the decision of whether to abort the foetus. Different
governments have their own regulations concerning this.
An example of the third point is a couple finding out that they might both be carriers of
the allele for Huntington disease. This is a late-onset condition that might not become
apparent until after they have a child. Would they want to know before having a child, if
their offspring could develop the condition? Would this change their own quality of life?
Remember, they might not develop the disease.

AND
IMPLICATIONS
Social
Social implications refer to the impact of the technology on more than one or two
individuals. For DNA profiling and genetic screening, some examples of questions to be
addressed are:
• The possibility of incorrect identification of a suspect from a sample of DNA obtained
from a crime scene – this could be caused by contamination of DNA. This would not
only affect the individual who has been wrongfully accused, as well as their partner
and/or immediate family, but would also have implications for the judicial system as a
whole (fairness/justice). So the question is: Is it right to convict a person based solely on
DNA evidence?
• Privacy of the information obtained from a DNA profile or genetic screen – for example,
what would the implications be for society if a DNA profile was held of every person,
even those not convicted of a crime? In Victoria, a DNA sample cannot be obtained
from a person unless they give permission. This gives the person the opportunity to
know beforehand the risks associated with storage of the information and, if digital
results are hacked or compromised, who might access their personal DNA information.
• Information about the possibility of inheriting a genetic disease – intending parents
might be faced with difficult reproductive decisions. This could be heightened
depending on whether they are planning to have a child or are already pregnant. They
could be faced with the ethical implications of choosing to terminate a pregnancy. This
could place strain on their relationship, and they might seek professional counselling.
• People who have a genetic predisposition to certain conditions may find they are
discriminated against by employers, insurers or other bodies.

Economic
Economic considerations refer to the cost implications of the technology – how it affects
individuals directly, as well as others in the community. For DNA profiling and genetic
screening, an example of questions to be addressed is:
• Expense of treatment – if a couple was informed of the risk of their potential offspring
inheriting a genetic disorder, their decision about whether to undergo IVF must include
the cost of treatment, as IVF is expensive. If the couple chose not to have a child, this
would avoid the expense not only for themselves, but for society, of providing the
medical and educational support that would be required for an affected child.
Biological
Biological implications can affect not only the organism in question, but more than one
organism or species. For DNA profiling and genetic screening, an example of questions
raised is:
• Altering the affected genome – for some inherited disorders, it may be possible to
correct the mutation that causes the condition, using gene editing. (This also raises
ethical issues.) The biological implications could be very significant for humans. For
example, gene editing can be seen as ‘interfering’ with evolution, by altering the future
inheritance of traits (alleles), some of which may disappear from the population.

Gene cloning
The universal nature of DNA
DNA is universal, but what does this mean? ‘Universal’ refers to the fact that the basic
structure of DNA is the same in every organism. The building blocks (monomers) you
learned about in Section 2A are identical in structure. The nitrogenous bases (adenine,
cytosine, guanine and thymine, and their complementarity) that make up part of these
monomers are identical. In essence this means that the DNA of one species can be
combined with the DNA of a different species, using a range of DNA manipulation
techniques, which were explored in Section 3A.
 Nowadays, genetic engineers can create genes, and
even complete genomes for some species, by using
artificial nucleotides in a laboratory setting. They
can work backwards from the desired final protein
sequence, by looking at the specific chain of amino
acids, identifying mRNA codons that code for these
and then using stored computer software to synthesise
the DNA nucleotides. This built sequence of DNA can
then be inserted directly into a plasmid (circular piece
of DNA in prokaryotes), all without the need for a
physical DNA template.

The gene cloning process combines the use of a plasmid with some of the DNA manipulation
techniques outlined in Section 3A. The key steps of this process in relation to inserting
the human insulin gene into bacteria for insulin protein production, which is vital in the
treatment of type I diabetes (T1D), are outlined in Figure 3B–8. If you studied Unit 1
Biology, you will already know that this disorder results from the cells that produce insulin,
beta cells in the pancreas, being targeted for destruction by the immune system. This is
known as an autoimmune disease. You will learn more about these types of diseases in
Section 7D.
Insulin is a vital protein-based hormone, responsible for controlling blood glucose levels by
reducing the concentration of blood glucose when it becomes too high. The process of gene
cloning (outlined in Figure 3B–8) is a way of mass-producing insulin for people with T1D.

100 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
Cloning the human insulin genes for treating type I diabetes
Two genes express the two distinct polypeptide chains that form human insulin. Steps 1-6 are done twice, once for
each gene, in different bacterial cultures. The two polypeptide chains are combined in Step 7 to form insulin.
Step 1: Opening up the plasmid
 Plasmid is cut with the specific restriction enzyme. This makes the initially circular DNA temporarily linear.
Antibiotic

Restriction
enzyme cuts ‘Sticky’ ends

produces sticky ends
Step 2: Isolating the gene of interest
Gene of interest (the DNA coding for the insulin protein) is cut using a specific restriction enzyme.

Restriction enzymes Any introns in this area are
also removed in this step
Insulin gene
Sticky end Sticky end
If the restriction enzyme in step 1 was one that resulted in ‘sticky end’ fragments, then the same restriction
enzyme must be used to cut the gene of interest as well. The ‘sticky ends’ must be complementary.
If the restriction enzyme was one that resulted in ‘blunt end’ fragments, any other blunt end restriction enzyme
may be used.
Step 3: Recombinant plasmids
The plasmid and gene of interest and β-galactosidase gene are mixed together with the enzyme DNA ligase which
joins them with phosphodiester bonds. This results in a closed circular piece of DNA again. This is called the
recombinant plasmid, as it has ‘recombined’ with a piece of foreign DNA.

Note: At this step it is common for the circular plasmid to re-join to itself with the help of DNA ligase, therefore
without taking up the gene of interest. This is referred to as a non-recombinant plasmid. The β-galactosidase
gene is taken up in recombinant plasmids as a marker for them, detected by a simple test.

doubling the number of cells each time – and
the number of plasmids increases even more,
as they replicate independently of the bacterial
reproduction). The insulin and marker genes are
expressed, producing fused insulin polypeptide

Step 6: Identifying bacteria with the recombinant plasmid
The traditional method of doing
this step is to use the antibiotic

plasmids as a way of locating the

have taken up the recombinant
plasmid) from untransformed
bacteria (those that have not taken
up the recombinant plasmid).

The bacteria are spread onto a
nutrient agar plate containing an antibiotic . Only those transformed bacteria that contain
the gene for antibiotic resistance are able to survive. Untransformed bacteria, which have
no plasmid, and therefore no antibiotic resistance gene, do not survive in this environment.
However, there are ethical concerns about using this technique. As the bacteria are able
to transfer plasmids between each other, and even to other species of bacteria (bacterial
conjugation), it is possible that this may result in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, possibly creating a ‘superbug’.
Another method of identifying bacteria with the recombinant plasmid is a test for the β-galactosidase protein made
by the marker gene. As in this example, the two methods may be used together.

the growth of bacteria;

Step 7: Extracting, purifying and combining the insulin polypeptides
Steps 1-6 have been performed twice in separate bacterial cultures to
produce a polypeptide from each of the two insulin genes. The two types
of polypeptide are separated from the β-galactosidase protein, purified,
and then combined together to produce functional insulin, ready to
provide to diabetic patients.

Implications of gene cloning
Ethical
The use of bacteria for gene cloning has overcome the ethical and animal welfare issues
associated with extracting proteins, like insulin, from animals such as pigs and cattle, or
from the cells of human donors. However, some people view the transfer of genes from one
species to another as unethical, regardless of the overall benefit it could provide to society.
Social
There are many advantages of gene cloning for society, including:
• reduced cost of therapeutics made with bacteria, providing greater access to treatments
for more individuals in the community
• the creation of employment opportunities in the biotechnology industry, as well as
marketing and sales of these products.
A potential disadvantage of gene cloning is its misuse for non-therapeutic purposes, such as
creating performance-enhancing drugs, giving athletes an unfair advantage in competitions.
Economic
An economic advantage of using bacteria for gene cloning is that it has made the
production of therapeutics, like insulin for diabetics, relatively cheap – large quantities can
be produced, with a reliable (constant) supply. However, it is still important to note that
this benefit depends on the country and the socioeconomic background of the individual.
Biological
Inserting human genes into plasmids, creating a recombinant plasmid, and performing
genetic transformation to make copies of proteins to give to patients, provides a purer or
more effective product than using proteins purified from animals. This has made new and
safer treatments for disorders and the development of vaccines possible. It also reduces the
chances of side effects or of transmitting diseases. The use of vaccines reduces the number
of deaths from diseases, and this contributes to an increase in the average life expectancy
of the population. This results in the birth rate increasing more than the death rate, and
the increase in the world’s population increases the strain on the environment and affects
other species that share our ecosystems. In the long term, this changes the course of natural
selection and our evolution.
The risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (superbugs) developing has already been outlined.
Such a development would be very difficult to overcome. This is covered in more detail in
Section 9C.

Gene cloning over PCR?
Through all the steps of gene cloning, you might have asked, ‘Why doesn’t the scientist just
isolate the insulin gene of interest and then use PCR to amplify this section of DNA?’
The answer is threefold.

gene can be converted into a fully functioning protein. For this to occur, there must
be a set-up in which protein synthesis can take place, and this requires the different
types of RNA and ribosomes that you learned about in Section 2C.
2 Bacteria reproduce by binary fission every 20 minutes – this means that every
20 minutes, the number of bacteria doubles. Even within this time, plasmids replicate
independently of the bacteria. Therefore, even more plasmids, and therefore copies of
the insulin gene, can be produced in every reproductive cell cycle.
3 PCR requires a number of expensive ingredients: samples of the four nucleotides, a
heat-resistant enzyme, and forward and reverse primers. In comparison, the use of
restriction enzymes and bacteria, like E. coli, is inexpensive.
Determining whether transformed bacteria have taken up the recombinant or
non-recombinant plasmid
The advantage of plasmids is that they usually contain, or can be constructed to contain,
genes that code for antibiotic resistance. This gives bacteria with that plasmid a survival
advantage in the presence of the antibiotic that they have resistance to.
Common examination questions in this topic involve how the transformed bacteria are
identified. To determine which bacteria are transformed, the bacteria are grown on agar
nutrient plates containing an antibiotic (e.g. ampicillin). The recombinant plasmid that
has been taken up by transformed bacteria has a gene for resistance. It is important to
recall here that it is also possible for transformed bacteria that contain a non-recombinant
plasmid (without the gene of interest) to survive, as they still contain the antibiotic-
resistance gene. This is shown in Figure 3B–9.

104 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
Figure 3 B–9 shows that three types of bacteria are possible after genetic transformation:
• containing no plasmid (very common)
• containing the non-recombinant plasmid
• containing the recombinant plasmid.
If all three types of bacteria are grown on an agar plate containing antibiotic, both types
of transformed bacteria will survive and reproduce. So how can a scientist work out
which bacteria contain the recombinant plasmid and which contain the non-recombinant
plasmid?
Hopefully you have worked out that the plasmids could be isolated from the bacteria
and run on gel electrophoresis. Th e recombinant plasmids with the foreign DNA inserted
should be larger than the non-recombinant plasmids without the foreign DNA. Th is is
shown in Figure 3 B–10.

Question:
The Genomics Health Futures Mission will run a $32 million trial, starting in 2019, to
screen over 10 000 couples who are in early pregnancy or who are planning to have a
baby. Using a blood test, individuals will be screened for over 500 severe or deadly
gene mutations.
Couples will be told they have a genetic mutation if both individuals in the couple
carry the same mutation. The trial may lead to a population-wide carrier screening
program. The researchers will evaluate cost effectiveness, psychological impact, ethics
and barriers to screening. It is anticipated that future tests will be free of charge.
The test may find that a couple who were planning to have a baby or who were
already pregnant both carry the same severe or deadly mutation.
Describe one ethical and one social issue/implication that could arise from this finding.
For this question, the stakeholder is the couple. Many answers would focus on the child
as the stakeholder or the future impact on the child, but the question clearly asks for the
implication that arises from this finding. The table below shows answers that would be
acceptable or not acceptable, for each implication.
Answer:
Ethical:

already pregnant but have not had the child)
Should a severely affected child,
who may suffer, be born?
The child may live a poor-quality life.
(Again, the child is not born yet)
Should alternative reproductive
therapies (like IVF) be accessed?
Issues for the child in knowing they have the
gene for the disease, as they did not give
consent for the test.
(Wrong, as this is not directly related to the
parents finding out this information.)
Who else has access to the
information from this finding?
What if insurance companies refuse to provide
life insurance to this individual in the future, if
they carry this disease-related gene?
(Wrong, as the gene in question would cause
health effects in the child, not the parents.)

It is important to practise answering these types of questions. Examples of questions
from the perspective of different stakeholders are provided at the end of this section and
in the chapter review and digital questions.
Linking ideas in a sequential nature
When answering questions, you should do so in a sequential way, although this isn’t
always easy. It can require you to change the way you think about what is happening.
Answering questions in this way helps the examiner see what you are thinking, and to
identify that you know your content and are able to link ideas together.
Let’s look at how to approach a question of this nature.
Question:
Explain the different types of enzymes used in the process of gene cloning. (2 marks)
Answer:
• To open up the plasmid and isolate the foreign DNA from an organism, the
strands need to be cut with restriction enzymes. These are enzymes that identify a
specific recognition site and cut the DNA at the sugar–phosphate backbone of the
two strands.
• For the plasmid and foreign DNA to be joined together, they may need to be cut
with the same restriction enzyme that produces complementary sticky ends.
• To join the two pieces of DNA together, the enzyme DNA ligase is used. This
enzyme works in the opposite way to a restriction enzyme, as a ‘glue’ joining
nucleotides at the sugar–phosphate backbone.

ENGAGE
The evolution of genetically modified organisms
Genetic modification really took off in 1973 when two scientists, Stanley Cohen and
Herbert Boyer, successfully removed an antibiotic resistance gene from one species of
bacteria (donor) and placed it into another species of bacteria (recipient). The recipient
bacteria then demonstrated antibiotic resistance.
You might think this is where the story begins, but humans have actually been ‘modifying’
organisms for thousands of years. As far back as 30 000 BC, humans were changing the
DNA of a particular species through the process of selective breeding, also referred to as
artificial selection, which you will learn more about in Chapter 9. What was this species? It
is one you are familiar with, if you look around when you go for a walk, watch TV or visit
a pet store: dogs! Our ancestors domesticated wild wolves in Eastern Asia and selectively
bred individuals to produce offspring that were initially more passive and compliant.
From there, and over thousands of
years, everything from hair length,
body shape and size, to colour, has
been selected for, resulting in the
many breeds that exist today. The
difference between selective breeding
and the current method of genetic
modification is that the process is
now much faster and does not require
many generations to pass before
change is noticeable.
With the rise of genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) and the
accompanying interest in them,
various stakeholders have expressed
their concerns about the implications,
for our own health and, more broadly,
that of the world’s ecosystems. As a
result, regulation of experiments and
appropriate safety measures have been
established for researchers, who also
educate others in the broader scientific
community about the significance of
their findings.

EXPLAIN
Genetically modified vs transgenically modified organisms
As discussed in Section 3B, genetic engineering involves the transfer of DNA from one
organism to another, resulting in recombinant DNA. If the recipient organism has had its
own genome modified (e.g. genes being switched on or off), or contains DNA from a donor
of the same species, then it is referred to as a genetically modified organism (GMO). However,
if the recipient organism contains DNA from a different species, then it is referred to as
a transgenically modified organism (TMO) (trans = across, genic = gene), or transgenic. The
bacteria used in the process of gene cloning for the human insulin gene (in Section 3B)
would be referred to as both genetically modified (their DNA has been manipulated) and
transgenic (they contain human DNA).

Increasing crop productivity
Making photosynthesis more efficient
When plants undergo photosynthesis, the process is not 100% efficient, as you will learn
in Section 5E. The process generates by-products that are damaging to the cellular
components that convert light into chemical energy, and increasing global temperatures are
causing this to occur more regularly.
Normally when chlorophyll in the grana of chloroplasts absorbs light, water is split,
creating oxygen, hydrogen ions and electrons. The electrons help to power photosynthesis.
However, heat can damage a key protein, D1, involved in this process. As such, scientists
have genetically modified plants, such as the mustard plant, tobacco and rice, to better
repair the damage caused by heat.
As you learned in Section 2B, DNA codes for proteins. In plant cells, DNA is located in
the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Chloroplast DNA codes for proteins that are
used by the chloroplast, like the D1 protein that is affected by heat. The issue with the
chloroplast DNA is that it is much harder to modify than nuclear DNA. Scientists have
removed the gene coding for this protein using restriction enzymes, combined it with a
section of DNA that is activated during ‘heat stress’ and moved it into the nucleus.
The result observed
in the mustard plant,
Arabidopsis thaliana,
was that it survived
extreme heat (41°C)
in the laboratory for 8
hours. Other studies with
the mustard plant saw an
80% increase in plant
biomass.

consecutive days. The transgenic crops yielded 8–10% more grain than normal plants. Even
at normal temperatures, the yield of the transgenic rice crops was 20% higher. As rice is a
staple worldwide, particularly in low-income countries, this increase in yield could help to
feed growing populations in a world of continually increasing global temperatures.

Increasing vitamin content: Golden Rice
As previously mentioned, rice plants have been
genetically modified over the past two decades. This
began in 2000, when scientists genetically engineered
rice, producing what they called Golden Rice as a way
to combat vitamin A deficiency, which kills over half a
million people each year.
This strain of rice was transgenically modified when
two genes, one from a daffodil and one from the
bacterium Pantoea ananatis, were inserted. The genes
result in the production of beta-carotene, which gives
the rice its distinctive yellow colour (hence the name
Golden Rice). Beta-carotene is also found in carrots,
Figure 3C–5 Comparison of GMO Golden Rice with
‘normal’ or standard rice
and when consumed by humans it is converted into
vitamin A. As rice is a relatively cheap staple food, especially in developing countries, this
transgenically modified (TMO) rice helps to reduce the number of people suffering from
vitamin A deficiency. The added advantage of Golden Rice is that research has proved that
these crops are unlikely to cross-pollinate unmodified crops, as rice crops usually self-
pollinate. And, unlike many other modified crops, the seeds can be re-planted season after
season, making it relatively cheap for farmers.

Improving disease resistance
Effect of fungus on wheat production
A disease known as wheat scab, caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum, has a huge
impact on the production of wheat and barley. The disease causes the grain to shrivel and
reduces the yield of these plants. The fungus also releases a toxin that remains in grain
destined for food consumption. If this toxin is in high concentrations, it can harm humans
and animals. Therefore, in many countries, these infected grains must be discarded.

which causes wheat scab. It can affect single (left) or multiple

As you will learn in Section 6B, fungal infections can be treated by spraying the plants
with chemicals, known as fungicides. However, the pathogen infects plants during winter,
meaning that rain can wash the fungicide away.
Scientists discovered a gene, called Fhb7, in a wild species related to wheat. This gene codes
for an enzyme, glutathione S-transferase, which is able to destroy trichothecenes (toxins
released by the fungus). This allows the continual reproduction of wheat that has Fusarium
resistance. The Fhb7 gene was thought to have originated from a fungus that normally lives
inside wild wheatgrass but does not cause disease, as the plant and the fungus exist together
in a mutual symbiotic relationship. At some point, the fungal DNA managed to combine
with the wheatgrass DNA, and is now incorporated into the wheatgrass genome. As you
learned in Section 3B, it is normally bacteria that are associated with the transfer of genes
between species of animals and plants – this was one of few examples of a fungus taking
this role.
Experiments highlighted the fact that adding the Fhb7 gene to wheat did not have any
negative effects on the grain’s yield and provided the wheat with some resistance to
fungal toxins.

Implications of genetically modifying plants
Below are outlined the types of implications, and examples of each, that need to be
considered when genetically modifying plants for increased crop productivity and/or
improved resistance to disease.
Ethical implications
Some of the major ethical implications raised by the use of GMOs
and TMOs are listed below. Note that most of these are negative
implications.
• Many individuals or groups consider the manipulation of any
organism’s genetic information to be unnatural.
• Is the consumption of genetically modified (GM) plants safe
for humans? Has there been enough research to prove whether
there are short- or long-term impacts on an individual’s health?
• If cross-pollination occurs between GM crops and non-GM
crops growing nearby, then the farmers of the non-GM crops
cannot claim that their crops are GM free. Also, the patents for
those GM crops could be owned by companies.
• Large biotechnology companies generally control the
production and distribution of GM seeds. Some GM seeds
become unviable (that is, they will not germinate) after just
one generation, which means farmers have to continually
re-purchase seeds, which can be expensive. Therefore,
although the rewards of increased crop yield and reduced
disease are potentially great, much of the farmer’s profit is

Social/economic implications
Remember from Section 3B that social implications
are those that have an impact on not only one or
two individuals but a greater proportion of society.
Some of the major social implications (both positive
and negative) of the use of GMOs and TMOs
are listed below. Note that many of these social
implications can be linked closely to economic
implications.
• Large companies that own the patents for
GM seeds control the market and the cost
of the seeds, and not all farmers can afford
this technology. This increases the inequality
between wealthier and poorer struggling farmers.
Those who are able to afford the GM seeds
initially can grow more crops, sell more and earn
more profit to buy seeds again in future seasons.
• The reduced need to use pesticides due to GM
crops’ improved resistance to disease could put
manufacturers of these products out of business because of reduced sales.
Figure 3C–9 Protesters tear up GM canola plants in 2002 at
a demonstration against GM crops at a farm in England. The
farm is being used as a government test bed for GM crops,
which the protesters say will pollute the environment with
GM pollen. Eighty protesters trespassed on the farm and tore
up the plants, before being arrested.

• Improved crop yield for plants such as rice and wheat could help to reduce malnutrition
and hunger, especially in low-income countries. As was seen with Golden Rice, GM food
with improved nutritional value may lead to a reduction in deficiencies (like vitamin A
deficiency), resulting in healthier populations.
• Plants that have been genetically modified to grow in harsher conditions due to climate
change could also help to reduce malnutrition in some countries.
• Giving consumers a choice as to whether they buy GM foods is becoming increasingly
important. (For example, the organic food industry has become very big in Western
countries.) This makes correct labelling of products as ‘GM’ or ‘GM free’ crucial, and has
been legislated in Australia.
Biological implications
Any unnatural (or natural) change to an organism’s genetic material that changes the way
it behaves has the potential to affect other living organisms in the same ecosystem. These
effects can be positive or negative. Some of the biological implications of GMO and TMO
plants are listed below.
• As GM crops can result in increased growth and yield of plants, less space is required for
growth. This means less land is cleared for farming, which reduces the loss of habitat for
other organisms.
• A reduction in the use of insecticides or pesticides means less of these chemicals flowing
into rivers and streams, and therefore less impact on aquatic life or other organisms that
drink this water (including humans, in some countries).
• Increased planting of GM crops could lead to loss of biodiversity, as the genomes
of GM crops are identical (or very similar). If selection pressures such as disease or
environmental changes occur, the lack of variation in the plant species could mean a
drastically reduced survival rate for the crop, resulting in shortages in the food supply for
a community or population.
• The genes from GM crops could be inadvertently transferred to another plant of the
same (or very similar) species that is not GM, via cross-pollination caused by insects or
wind. This links back to the ethical implications mentioned previously.
NOTE
It is important to be aware that much of the work in genetic modification has been conducted on,
and is established with, animals. This includes the benefits of the production of increased supply
of food (e.g. milk) and resources (e.g. wool). This is not covered in this text, as the curriculum only
requires you to focus on genetically modified organisms relating to increased agricultural yield
and improved resistance to disease (plants).

Should we grow GM crops?
by Mary Nugyen
More than 25 years after genetically modified (GM) food first appeared, growing
GM crops remains a hotly debated topic. Some people argue that GM crops are
the only way to feed the growing world population and to minimise environmental
harm. Other people express different views.
Bt cotton is a type of cotton that contains two genes from a soil bacterium, Bacillus
thuringiensis, enabling it to produce insect-resistant proteins. Australian farmers of
Bt cotton use only 15% of the quantity of the insecticide that was once needed to
protect their cotton crops. However, Bt cotton is not as resistant to the main insect
pest of cotton crops, Helicoverpa, as it has been in the past.
In Australia, Bt cotton is picked by machine, but in India, it is picked by hand.
Workers in India have developed skin allergies, which have been attributed to Bt
cotton proteins.
Traditionally, farmers have saved money by keeping seed from one year’s crop
to plant the following year. However, it is illegal for farmers to keep Bt cotton
seeds because these seeds have been declared the legal property of the company
Monsanto. Every year, cotton farmers must buy more seeds from Monsanto.
Unlike Monsanto, the company that produces the GM food crop Golden Rice
allows farmers to replant the rice they harvested the previous year. By inserting a
gene from the bacterium Erwinia uredovora and another from a daffodil, Narcissus
pseudonarcissus, into white rice, scientists produced Golden Rice – a rice variety
containing higher levels of vitamin A. People who eat Golden Rice avoid vitamin A
deficiency. Trials conducted in several countries have shown that Golden Rice is safe
to eat.
Here is a question that followed this information.
Question:
Using information from the article, complete the table below by describing one social
and one biological implication relevant to the use of Bt cotton and Golden Rice. The
same implication should not be used twice.
To develop your answer, use a highlighter (or different colours, as shown in this

Gene editing to improve adaptability
The ability to change an organism’s DNA through genetic modification (as discussed
in Section 3C) could be of huge benefit to the international fishery industry. These
changes could allow the Australian fishery industry to avoid time-consuming and costly
GM regulations as set by the country’s jurisdictions, because the slight DNA changes
involved result in variations that could occur naturally within a population. As you will
see in Section 9B, this variation in a species could make it more adaptable to changes in
selection pressures, such as disease or drought. This would allow the industry to plan
productively for a world experiencing rapid climate change and growing population.
One of the newest forms of gene editing technology is CRISPR-Cas9, which targets
a specific location on a gene and inserts, deletes or replaces DNA at this location.
One possible application of this method is to make fish, like salmon, sterile so that
they do not spend energy reproducing and instead use their energy for rapid growth.
This technology could also be broadened to include environmental productivity, by
engineering plants to provide fish with a suitable array of nutrients, enabling further
growth. This technology could allow food industries such as fisheries to keep up with
growing population demand.

3D The futuRE of GENoME EDITING
121
EXPLAIN
Previous methods of genetic engineering
The first genome editing techniques were developed
towards the end of the 1900s. For many years, the
main technique used viruses as a way of inserting
DNA into cells or rectifying ‘mistakes’ in the DNA
of an individual. This was called gene therapy.
However, this technique was imprecise, and so there
were issues associated with it. The main concern was
that there was no control over where the DNA was
inserted. For example, it could enter in the middle of
Figure 3D–2 Gene delivery using a
viral vector to transfer DNA into a
human host is an imprecise method.
another gene in the DNA of the recipient organism
and subsequently disrupt the normal code for making that gene’s protein. That could have
dire consequences for the survival of the organism.
The ‘evolution’ of genetic engineering – CRISPR-Cas9
In 2009, a pattern of DNA now known as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeat) was discovered in bacteria, and its use as a gene editing tool began.
Breaking down the full name of CRISPR may help you to understand what it is.
• Clustered – positioned close together
• Regularly – present at particular intervals
• Interspaced – the repeated sequences have non-repeating spacers between them
• Short – measuring a small distance from end to end
• Palindromic – a word, or in this case a sequence, that reads the same forwards as it
does backwards
• Repeat – present more than once.
Therefore, CRISPR is a small sequence of a few nucleotides in DNA that is the same
forwards and backwards, repeated one after the other with spacers in between, close
together in regular intervals in a genome.
The role of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria
These sequences of DNA were discovered in E. coli bacteria in 1987. However, it was not
until 2007 that their role in defence against bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria)
was determined. CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to edit DNA in various organisms, including
humans, since around 2012.
CRISPR is a group of nucleotides that codes for short sequences of RNA. A CRISPR-
associated enzyme, called Cas9, is able to cut at a specific region of the DNA, determined by
sequences of RNA, called guide RNA (gRNA). Each gRNA contains 20 nucleotides that are
able to bind to a complementary sequence of a strand of DNA nucleotides after it unwinds
the DNA. The endonuclease, Cas9, has a recognition site for a 3-nucleotide sequence
called the PAM sequence and two active sites able to cut both strands of DNA at the sugar–
phosphate backbone, like a restriction enzyme would. The PAM sequence is not naturally
present in bacteria but is in bacteriophage viruses that insert their genome into bacteria.
Cas9 will only cut if it recognises the PAM sequence; therefore, the latter plays an essential
role in distinguishing self from non-self for bacteria.
At this point, the cell’s natural DNA repair mechanisms do one or both of the following:
• adding nucleotides that alter the sequence of DNA
• inserting a short region of DNA with a specific nucleotide sequence.

In bacteria, cutting up viral genetic material ensures that the virus can no longer replicate
and damage the bacteria. (You will learn about viruses in Section 6C.) The Cas9 enzyme
can include regions of the viral DNA by inserting them as the spacers into the CRISPR
sequence, so the bacteria have a memory of past infections by the same virus. The CRISPR
nucleotide sequence is also passed on to daughter bacterial cells when the bacteria
reproduce by binary fission, so they also have a memory of the virus.
To use the bacteria-derived CRISPR-Cas9 tool to cut the genome of an organism, single
guide RNA is created with a sequence complementary to the target of the cut, which is
adjacent to a PAM sequence. The sgRNA and Cas9 recognise the PAM sequence, enabling
the right cut to be made (Figure 3D–3).

3D THE FUTURE OF GENOME EDITING

The future of CRISPR-Cas9
The development of the
CRISPR-Cas9 system means
that the gRNA nucleotides can
be built artificially. Therefore, a
scientist can essentially design a
sequence to match any specific
sequence of nucleotides in DNA
and control where in another
organism’s DNA the Cas9
enzyme will cut. Unlike the use
of viruses for gene editing, as
described earlier, this technique
allows genetic engineers to
remove a faulty allele (version
of a gene) and insert a normal
functioning allele with extreme
precision, thereby giving the
organism a therapeutic benefit.

Other potential uses of CRISPR-Cas9
When scientists discovered the advantages of CRISPR, including that the process is cheap,
easy and accurate, they soon discovered how it could be reprogrammed to edit the genomes
of different species. Research in manipulating the role of CRISPR-Cas9 has included the
following breakthroughs:
• One of the two active sites of the Cas9 enzyme can be deactivated and new enzymes
added. The Cas9 then transports these enzymes to a specific DNA sequence. This means
scientists can alter a single nucleotide, so an allele that causes a disorder can be removed,
LINK
or a nucleotide that results in a stop codon being produced in mRNA transcribed from
2B THE GENETIC
CODE AND GENE
EXPRESSION
that DNA can be introduced.
• Adding transcription activators that attach
to either the Cas9 enzyme or the gRNA
and encourage RNA polymerase to
bind more readily to the DNA results
in an increased rate of transcription.
Alternatively, a gene can be silenced
by incorporating more factors that
block the action of RNA polymerase in
transcription.
• Fluorescent proteins can be added to
the Cas9, which allows scientists to
locate a specific gene in an organism’s
genome and/or follow this gene and the
chromosome it is on through cell division.
• Several diseases can be treated, including
editing cancer genes and potential for
removing HIV genes from sufferers.

Questions about CRISPR-Cas9
The use of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome editing tool is new content in the current Study
Design. The Study Design states that students need to know:
The function of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria and the application of this function in editing
an organism’s genome
The function of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria is immune defence against genes that viruses
inject into them to express as proteins and reproduce. A nucleotide sequence from the
virus is incorporated into the bacterium’s CRISPR sequence as a ‘memory’, so the next
time that virus is encountered, the bacterium produces gRNA, which directs Cas9 to cut
the viral gene up into pieces.
This function can be applied to genome editing in live cells in the laboratory, through
the following steps and diagram:
1 Guide RNA is created to
match the desired gene
sequence to be edited.
2 This gRNA, along with
Cas9, is injected into
the cell.
3 When the guide RNA binds
to its target gene sequence,
the active sites of the Cas9
enzyme make a precise cut
in the organism’s DNA.
4 The cell’s own DNA repair
enzymes repair the break.
5 Scientists can manipulate
the repair enzymes to
delete or disrupt the gene
at the repair site, thereby
preventing a harmful gene
from being expressed.
Or they can insert a
new sequence of DNA
nucleotides to change
a detrimental allele to a
beneficial one.

3D THE FUTURE OF GENOME EDITING
125
It is highly unlikely that an examination question would ask you to recall the steps of the
action of CRISPR-Cas9, although an internal school assessment may.
Here is an example of a question on the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in editing an organism’s
genome:
Question:
What is the advantage of using CRISPR-Cas9 over other DNA tools that are able to
cut the DNA, like restriction enzymes?
Answer:
CRISPR-Cas9 uses guide RNA (gRNA) that can be artificially designed to bind with
a specific sequence of nucleotides, enabling Cas9 to cut the DNA at a precise point,
whereas restriction enzymes cannot be guided in the same way and will cut DNA
at a recognition site that may occur anywhere along the strand. Also, gRNA is 20
nucleotides long, compared to a recognition site, which is only 4–6 nucleotides long.
So the gRNA is likely to find only one complementary site in the whole genome,
whereas there are likely to be many restriction enzyme recognition sites. The gRNA
is more specific in where it allows the Cas9 enzyme to cut the DNA, as opposed to a
restriction enzyme.
If you look back at the steps of the action of CRISPR-Cas9 above, step 3 discusses the
action of the enzyme Cas9. Other questions relating to enzyme structure and function,
the role of the active sites, what they bind to (substrate) and the specificity of these
enzymes could also be asked. Enzymes are discussed in Section 4A.
Additionally, questions about transcription (Section 2B) or mutations (Section 9A) could
also relate to this concept. Therefore, it is important to use the concept maps provided at
the beginning of each chapter and your own developed concept maps across the entire
curriculum to find as many links between content as possible. The links to other chapters

13 A transgenically modified species of Bt cotton exists where two genes from the bacterium
Bacillus thuringiensis have been inserted into the cotton crop’s genome. These two genes code
for proteins that are lethal to a caterpillar that feeds on the plant, by disrupting its digestive
system. For farmers in Australia, this has reduced reliance on pesticides, which greatly reduces
the environmental impact of pesticide use, on other organisms. It has also reduced the amount
spent on pesticides by farmers. However, it is illegal for farmers to re-plant the Bt cotton seeds
in successive seasons, due to legal declarations established by the biotechnology company
that sells them to farmers. The seeds are the property of this company. The long-term cost of
buying seeds each year could be more than the farmers save on pesticides.

both related and unrelated individuals for the purpose of investigations.
a What is the name of the regions of DNA that DNA profiling typically focuses on? (1 mark)
 At a football game, a mother and father accidently became separated from their son.
Coincidently, on the same day two other families also lost sight of their sons. At the end of the
match, the first couple in question located the security station at the ground to collect their
son. However, the security staff wanted to be 100% sure about which of the three children
actually belonged to the parents. For this reason, they decided to bring in the police and their
forensic science team to perform a DNA profile of each parent and the three lost children.
They investigated one region of DNA and compared the size of the DNA fragments in this
region on each of their two chromosomes containing this gene (In this hypothetical scenario
the children are biologically related to their parents). The results are shown below, for the sizes
of those DNA fragments.
DNA region Mother 3, 8 Father Lost child 1 Lost child 2 Lost child 3
‘X’ 6, 10 3, 6 10, 13 8, 10

c Based on your answer to part b and your knowledge of DNA profiling, what should the
forensic scientists have done differently? (1 mark)
d The method used to generate results in this test was digital. Another technique that could
have been used to identify these different-sized fragments of DNA was gel electrophoresis.

• all results for individuals shown in the table above
• wells on the gel
• positive and negative electrodes, including the direction of DNA movement
• a DNA standard that results from individuals can be compared to. (4 marks)
e Explain how the technique in your answer to part d would distinguish between different-
sized fragments of DNA. In your answer, explain how the material the DNA separates on
facilitates this separation. (3 marks)

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can explain what genetic screening is and give examples of disorders it can detect
CODE: 3B.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
Genetic screening is a form of DNA profiling used to analyse an individual's DNA for a particular allele associated with a disorder. It can be conducted on adults (carrier testing), on a foetus (prenatal testing), or on newborns (postnatal testing).

WHY (importance):
Genetic screening allows early detection and treatment of genetic disorders, but also raises significant ethical questions about how the information should be used.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
Prenatal genetic screening can detect conditions such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Huntington disease, and thalassaemia. Postnatal screening of newborns can detect phenylketonuria (PKU), allowing immediate dietary changes that prevent intellectual disability.

SUBTOPIC: DNA Profiling and Genetic Screening
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers DNA profiling using variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), interpreting gel electrophoresis results for profiling, genetic screening for inherited disorders, and the ethical, social, economic and biological implications of these technologies.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: DNA profiling is one of the most important real-world applications of DNA manipulation techniques. Understanding how VNTRs are used to identify individuals, and being able to interpret gel results, connects molecular tools to forensic science, paternity testing and genetic counselling.

TOPIC: DNA Manipulation Techniques and Their Applications
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The use of molecular tools to manipulate DNA, including restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, PCR and gel electrophoresis, and their applications in DNA profiling, gene cloning for insulin production, genetically modified organisms, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.

ENGAGE
Forensic science on TV
As you may have seen in crime dramas like CSI or NCIS, the investigators are able to
obtain DNA samples from a crime scene, get them back to the lab and have a result
all within a few hours. Often, they carry out a number of DNA techniques to help
solve a crime, within a 40-minute episode. In reality, even though the same methods
are used, the process is much slower. Some of the DNA analysis tools explored in
this section, such as
restriction enzymes,
gel electrophoresis
and the polymerase
chain reaction, take
many hours to run. In
addition to the time
that these methods
take, prior analysis and
preparation of materials
are required. The TV
versions also do not
account for the fact that
some techniques need
to be run one after the
other, in order to obtain
meaningful results.

EXPLAIN
The importance of DNA
DNA is a macromolecule that is passed from pre-existing cells to new cells. In this way,
offspring inherit their DNA from their parent(s). As you learned in Section 2B, each cell of
an organism contains the entire complement of the organism’s DNA, also known as their
genome. This chapter focuses on applying your knowledge of the structure and function of
DNA and how different molecular tools can be used to manipulate this DNA.

Restriction enzymes occur naturally in bacteria (some are also found in viruses, archaea and
eukaryotes), where they serve the same ‘scissor-like’ purpose but for a defence mechanism.
They cut the DNA of a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria, shown in Figure 3A–3)
into fragments. The bacterium’s own DNA is protected from these restriction enzymes by
chemical modification and enzymes that modify the bacterial DNA so it is not recognised
by the restriction enzyme, or by simply not having the recognition site in the first place.

Differences between restriction enzymes
There are more than 3000 different restriction enzymes, with only around 600 of these
commercially available to scientists. Each restriction enzyme recognises a specific
recognition site in the DNA. Restriction enzymes are therefore named based on the
following international guidelines:
• abbreviation, in letters, of the name of the bacterium in which they are naturally found
• Roman numerals after the letters to classify the specific enzyme from the same
bacterium (as usually there is more than one).
As an example, HaeIII is the third endonuclease isolated from the bacterium Haemophilus
aegyptius. Table 3A–1 shows HaeIII and four other restriction enzymes, to highlight the
differences between them.

ENDONUCLEASES
Note the red arrows in column two of Table 3A–1. These indicate the location in the
sugar–phosphate backbone where the specific restriction enzyme digests (cuts) the DNA.
This location within the recognition site determines whether the fragments of DNA
produced from this will result in sticky ends or blunt ends (shown in columns three and
four). Note also that each recognition site is usually 4–6 base pairs long and is a palindrome.
This means they read the same in a 5′ (5 prime) to 3′ (3 prime) direction on the template
strand as they do on the coding strand, remembering that the two strands of DNA run in
opposite directions, as you learned in Section 2A.
For example, in EcoRI (in Table 3A–1), the coding strand reads GAATTC and the template
strand reads GAATTC, if looking at both from the 5′ end first.

DNA ligase
In genetic engineering, sometimes two fragments of DNA need to be joined. This is
essentially the reverse effect of restriction enzymes, which digest DNA. To join fragments
of DNA, an enzyme is required, as is the case for most processes that occur within the
body. This enzyme is called DNA ligase . Its role is to catalyse the joining of pieces of double-
stranded DNA at their sugar–phosphate backbone. This joining of fragments of DNA can
create a longer linear strand of DNA, or even a circular DNA molecule. It can also join
fragments of DNA from different species. These techniques are explored in Section 3B. DNA ligase

Figure 3A–4 DNA ligase acts as a ‘glue’ that joins two fragments of DNA together at the sugar–
phosphate backbone.
The types of ends matter for DNA ligase
As you will recall, blunt end fragments of DNA are produced when the restriction enzyme
cuts straight across the sugar–phosphate backbone of both DNA strands. As they have no
overhanging nucleotides, DNA ligase is able to join them with any other fragment of DNA
that also has a blunt end, though with more difficulty than when there are overhangs. This
is random and not overly specific.
Sticky end fragments are produced when the restriction enzyme cuts between the same
pair of nucleotides in the palindromic recognition site on each strand of DNA. This
results in overhanging nucleotides that DNA ligase can only join to another fragment
of DNA containing complementary overhanging nucleotides. If not, the overhanging
nucleotides would not form complementary base pairs due to hydrogen bonding between
the nitrogenous bases A and T, and C and G, as you learned in Section 2A. Therefore,
this fragment must also have been cut with the same restriction enzyme (shown in
Figure 3A–4 ), making sticky ends of DNA more specific than blunt ends.

Polymerase chain reaction
In order to work effectively with DNA, it is necessary to have more than a single copy or a
few copies of it. Therefore, a simple method is needed to amplify the DNA to produce large
quantities in a short amount of time. This method is called the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). As you will see later in this section, PCR is particularly useful for forensic scientists to
amplify certain regions of the DNA from traces of blood found at a crime scene.
The polymerase chain reaction uses a mixture of ingredients that are heated and cooled
in cycles. After each cycle, the number of copies of the DNA is doubled. At the beginning
of the process, the ingredients are added to a microtube, which is then placed in a
thermocycler (a machine that acts as a heating block to rapidly change the temperature for
each stage). The stages of the cycle are outlined in Table 3A–2.

PCR is an extremely sensitive process. Any contamination in the original DNA template or

ELECTROPHORESIS
DOC
Gel electrophoresis
Biologists usually work with large amounts of DNA and long strands of DNA. This means
that when a sample of DNA is mixed with restriction enzyme(s), fragments of differing
lengths are produced. Often, biologists are only interested in one section of this DNA and
so they need to isolate the relevant fragment. This is made even more difficult because
DNA is too small to see and is colourless. This is where gel electrophoresis proves valuable.
The basic process of gel electrophoresis is as follows:
1 Digested samples containing the DNA fragments and a dye are loaded into wells at one
end of an agarose gel.
2 The gel is covered in a solution containing ions, which allows the movement of DNA
fragments when an electric field is applied to the gel through a negative electrode at the
well end and a positive electrode at the other end. DNA is negatively charged due to the
phosphate groups.
3 The negatively charged DNA migrates from the wells at the negative electrode of the gel
towards the positive electrode. DNA from each well stays in the ‘lane’ running from each
well. The DNA fragments separate according to their size and the charge they carry.
Smaller DNA fragments travel faster (and therefore further) than larger fragments.
4 The dye in the samples travels faster than the DNA and, when the ‘dye front’ (its
position) reaches the positive electrode, the power is turned off and the gel plate is
removed for analysis.
5 At the end, when the agarose gel has been removed, a different dye that attaches to DNA
can be added and this reveals where the DNA fragments are.

NOTE
All DNA fragments of the same size in a sample will migrate to the same distance from the well
and end up at the same point in that lane. The particular fragment that a scientist is seeking can
then be cut out from the gel and used in experiments.
The reason for adding ‘loading’ dye to the sample at the beginning is that DNA is colourless
and during the ‘run’ the operator can’t see how far it has moved. This allows a scientist to
determine the time at which to stop the gel electrophoresis process, and therefore the time
at which the DNA fragments have had the longest to separate. The ‘invisibility’ of the DNA
is also the reason for using a different dye to reveal it on the agarose gel. Dyes that fluoresce
under ultraviolet light can also be attached to the DNA. The glowing patches can then be
digitally photographed for analysis.
The importance of a control
In gel electrophoresis, conditions can vary each time a gel is run. These conditions include the:
• voltage of the power source
• percentage of agarose in the gel (agarose is a polysaccharide added to the gel to control
the rate at which fragments move through the gel)
• concentration of the solution (a ‘buffer’) covering the agarose gel
• temperature of the environment
• pH of the buffer solution
• length of time the sample of DNA is allowed to run for in the gel
• length of the gel (distance between the negative and positive electrodes).
As such, the distance that particular-sized fragments of DNA will migrate through the
gel will not be the same every time. This means scientists cannot use something as simple
as a ruler to measure the distance
bp
travelled by a fragment of DNA to
determine its size.
10 000
One lane in the gel must always
be used to run a control. In gel
electrophoresis, this is called a DNA
standard , or DNA ladder. A DNA
standard is a DNA sample that has
been digested with a particular
restriction enzyme that produces
many different-sized fragments
of DNA with known lengths.
These DNA standards are usually
purchased and come with a pictorial
representation of the fragments
expected to be seen on a gel and
their respective sizes, usually in base
pairs (bp) or kilo base pairs (kbp).
This allows the scientist to compare
the sizes of the fragments in their
DNA sample to the fragments with
known size from the DNA standard
( Figure 3A–7 ).

Applying knowledge of DNA structure to restriction enzymes
Recall from Section 2A that the structure of DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is
different. In prokaryotes the DNA is circular, whereas in eukaryotes the DNA is linear.
This has a huge impact on the number of fragments that can be produced from digestion
with restriction enzymes. It also means that reading the question correctly is crucial.
For example:
Question:
In this linear piece of DNA, the restriction enzyme BglII has two recognition sites.
How many fragments would be produced?
BglII BglII
740 kbp
Answer:
Three
However, if the question was worded slightly differently, a different answer would be
required. For example:
Question:
The following DNA taken from a prokaryote was digested with the restriction
enzyme BglII, which has two recognition sites. How many fragments would be
produced?

The key to reading this question is to understand that DNA from prokaryotic cells is
circular. Even though the figure shows linear DNA, it is there to test whether you have
read the question carefully and understand the differences between different types of
cells. The parts of each question marked in yellow above are examples of what would be
good for you to highlight or underline as you are reading through the question.
Use of a heat-resistant DNA polymerase in PCR
The DNA polymerase used for PCR comes from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus
aquaticus, which has evolved to live in extremely hot environments. As such, the optimal
temperature for its enzymes is approximately 72°C. As the optimal temperature for this
enzyme is so high, it is not denatured (three-dimensional functional shape permanently
altered – more on this in Section 4B) even when heating to temperatures above 90°C.
As you can imagine, this is very different to the optimal temperature of the same DNA
polymerase enzymes typically found in humans and other animals, which have an
optimal temperature of 37°C.
Questions will be along the lines of: ‘Why can’t human DNA polymerase be used in the
PCR process?’. The answer to this is as explained above, and it means you need to be
able to apply your understanding of different concepts across topics. You should always
provide a comparison in this case between the two, and reference to the specific stage
that would affect the enzyme here.

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics
The traditional method of producing insulin for treating diabetes involved extracting
insulin from the pancreas of pigs and cows. A problem with this technique was that
some people developed antibodies against animal insulin, which made it ineffective.
Insulin is now produced by recombinant DNA techniques, in which the human
insulin-producing gene is inserted into bacteria.
LINK 7D THIRD LINE
OF DEFENCE
Pig pancreas Insulin extracted Insulin purified, pasteurised and bottled
Figure 3B–1 Insulin was originally taken from the pancreas of pigs and cows.
However, bacteria can transfer plasmids (circular rings of DNA) between each other and
also to different species of bacteria. For this reason there has been some trepidation on
the part of scientists in using bacteria to make copies of human genes. Their concerns
centre on the fact that, even though these bacteria are modified in strict isolation and
under tightly controlled conditions, the process may inadvertently create a strain of
genetically modified bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.
As you will see in this section, in the process of gene cloning, the use of antibiotic-
resistance genes in plasmids to identify bacteria with the inserted human genes is
gradually being replaced by the use of enzymes that make fluorescent substances.
The most common example, which you can do in the school laboratory, is using an
enzyme from jellyfish that produces a green fluorescent protein (GFP). As the name
suggests, these jellyfish fluoresce green when exposed to UV light. In the same way that
the gene of interest would be inserted into the plasmid, the gene for GFP is inserted,
thereby avoiding the need to use antibiotic resistance genes.

DNA profiling
The main use of the process of gel electrophoresis, which you studied in Section 3A, in
forensic science is in DNA profiling, or DNA fingerprinting.
In DNA profiling, analysts need to find unique patterns that will identify an individual.
Regions of DNA that code for certain proteins or enzymes are not useful for DNA profiling,
because they code for products or functions that are the same in everyone. So analysts
instead study stretches of non-coding regions of DNA. These are called ‘short tandem
repeats’ (STRs) if they are 2–6 base pairs long, or variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs)
if they are longer, typically 20–60 base pairs. The number of repeats can vary between
individuals. If only one region was focused on, the number of repeats of the sequence
could be the same in two individuals. Therefore, in humans, 13 of these VNTR regions are
studied in DNA profiling, so the chance of two individuals having exactly the same number
of nucleotide repeats at each location would be very low. In fact, only identical twins have
the same VNTRs at each region. Each individual has some VNTRs (and STRs) that come
from their parents. The VNTRs can be inherited from either the mother or the father and
can be a combination of both. An individual’s VNTRs will never have sequences that are
not present in their parents. Each individual has two copies of each VNTR, because they
are alleles, one from each pair of homologous chromosomes (chromosomes of the same size,
centromere and banding pattern from the mother and father).

Therefore, VNTRs can be used to identify a criminal from biological evidence found at a
crime scene, or to identify the father of a child in a paternity test. The steps in this process
are as follows:
1 DNA is extracted from the cells obtained from an individual (e.g. blood, semen or hair
from a crime scene).
2 The DNA of the 13 different VNTR regions (or a set number of these) is amplified by
PCR.
3 The DNA is cut with specific restriction enzymes (or multiple restriction enzymes) that
have recognition sites at either side of the VNTR regions.
4 The DNA fragments are loaded into wells on agarose gel and separated by gel
electrophoresis.
Smaller alleles, or nucleotide sequences of DNA, have fewer repeats of the short sequence
and will therefore migrate faster and further through the agarose gel than larger alleles with
more repeats. This is shown in Figure 3B–3.

In addition to forensic scientists using DNA profiling to identify the perpetrator of a crime,
or geneticists using it to determine a paternal parent, this technique can be used to:
• identify victims following a mass disaster
• identify human or animal fossils that can provide information about possible
evolutionary links
• develop a DNA database of wildlife. If there are only a few bands that differ between
individuals, indicating little genetic diversity, conservation measures can be
implemented to maximise that species’ chances of survival. Hence, breeding programs
could be initiated by zoos where genetically different individuals are bred to increase the
genetic diversity of the species.

Genetic screening
Genetic screening is a form of DNA profiling used to analyse an individual’s DNA for
a particular version of a gene (allele) they might be carrying. Genetic screening can be
conducted on adults when they suspect they may be carrying an allele for a disorder they
could pass onto their offspring. It can also be conducted on a foetus to test for the presence
of a disorder (prenatal testing) or on a newborn baby (postnatal testing). It is used to
identify cases where a baby may develop disorders such as those listed in Table 3B–1.
Many other common medical conditions can be detected as part of postnatal testing,
including phenylketonuria (PKU) and hypothyroidism. The benefit of screening for these
conditions is that it allows immediate treatment and/or changes in lifestyle to reduce the
negative effects of the condition.

Implications of DNA analysis technologies: overview
In selecting a DNA analysis/application technique to use, scientists need to consider the
ethical, social, economic and biological implications of that technology. It is also important
to identify the stakeholder and how the technology is likely to affect them, directly or
indirectly. The stakeholder is anyone (or an organisation) who will be affected by the
technology. Table 3B–2 outlines these implications.
Table 3B–2 Ethical, social, economic and biological implications of DNA analysis technology
Implication Definition Relation to stakeholder
Ethical A sense of right or wrong
in producing or obtaining
the technology, based on
morals and beliefs
The decision to engage with a technology will depend on the
individual’s personal ethical considerations.
Conducting scientific research involving humans or animals (e.g.
drug trials) requires approval by an ethics committee.
Social The influence of the
technology on society,
rather than just one or
two individuals
An individual’s decision making is influenced by the context
they are in. For example, different countries, or even different
communities within the same country, have different attitudes about
what is socially acceptable in regards to different technologies.
Government legislation is also different from country to country.
Economic The availability of funds
to obtain or produce the
technology
The cost of developing and using some technologies can be
prohibitive, and so they may not be equally accessible to all.
It is also important to consider who is funding the technology. For
example, results might be biased by emphasising positive outcomes
and downplaying negative outcomes.
Biological The effect of a
technology on other living
organisms in a particular
environment
The use of some technologies can affect the survival of other
organisms within an ecosystem. It may also change the course of
evolution, for better or worse.
The questions raised about these issues, and their answers, will depend on their context
and which stakeholder’s viewpoint is being considered. This is discussed further in the
3B Skills section.

Implications of DNA profiling and genetic screening
Ethical
DOC
Essentially, ethics deal with questions of right or wrong, or ‘Should I or shouldn’t I?’ In the case
of DNA profiling and genetic screening, some examples of questions to be dealt with are:
• Informed consent for DNA sampling – this is an issue
for children under the age of 18 years, who at the time
of having a DNA sample collected rely on parents to
provide consent on their behalf.
• Secure storage of DNA information – who has access to
this information and what would happen if it fell into the
wrong hands? For example, could insurance companies
make it difficult or costly for an individual to obtain
health or life insurance if they were identified as having a
genetic predisposition to developing a disease?
• Reliability of DNA analysis results as evidence of a foetus
having a genetically inherited disorder – if a foetus is
identified as having the genetic potential to develop
a particular disorder, the parents are then faced with
Figure 3B–4 Parents being counselled on results
of genetic testing and their likelihood of having a
child with a genetic disorder
the decision of whether to abort the foetus. Different
governments have their own regulations concerning this.
An example of the third point is a couple finding out that they might both be carriers of
the allele for Huntington disease. This is a late-onset condition that might not become
apparent until after they have a child. Would they want to know before having a child, if
their offspring could develop the condition? Would this change their own quality of life?
Remember, they might not develop the disease.

IMPLICATIONS
Social
Social implications refer to the impact of the technology on more than one or two
individuals. For DNA profiling and genetic screening, some examples of questions to be
addressed are:
• The possibility of incorrect identification of a suspect from a sample of DNA obtained
from a crime scene – this could be caused by contamination of DNA. This would not
only affect the individual who has been wrongfully accused, as well as their partner
and/or immediate family, but would also have implications for the judicial system as a
whole (fairness/justice). So the question is: Is it right to convict a person based solely on
DNA evidence?
• Privacy of the information obtained from a DNA profile or genetic screen – for example,
what would the implications be for society if a DNA profile was held of every person,
even those not convicted of a crime? In Victoria, a DNA sample cannot be obtained
from a person unless they give permission. This gives the person the opportunity to
know beforehand the risks associated with storage of the information and, if digital
results are hacked or compromised, who might access their personal DNA information.
• Information about the possibility of inheriting a genetic disease – intending parents
might be faced with difficult reproductive decisions. This could be heightened
depending on whether they are planning to have a child or are already pregnant. They
could be faced with the ethical implications of choosing to terminate a pregnancy. This
could place strain on their relationship, and they might seek professional counselling.
• People who have a genetic predisposition to certain conditions may find they are
discriminated against by employers, insurers or other bodies.

Economic
Economic considerations refer to the cost implications of the technology – how it affects
individuals directly, as well as others in the community. For DNA profiling and genetic
screening, an example of questions to be addressed is:
• Expense of treatment – if a couple was informed of the risk of their potential offspring
inheriting a genetic disorder, their decision about whether to undergo IVF must include
the cost of treatment, as IVF is expensive. If the couple chose not to have a child, this
would avoid the expense not only for themselves, but for society, of providing the
medical and educational support that would be required for an affected child.
Biological
Biological implications can affect not only the organism in question, but more than one
organism or species. For DNA profiling and genetic screening, an example of questions
raised is:
• Altering the affected genome – for some inherited disorders, it may be possible to
correct the mutation that causes the condition, using gene editing. (This also raises
ethical issues.) The biological implications could be very significant for humans. For
example, gene editing can be seen as ‘interfering’ with evolution, by altering the future
inheritance of traits (alleles), some of which may disappear from the population.

Gene cloning
The universal nature of DNA
DNA is universal, but what does this mean? ‘Universal’ refers to the fact that the basic
structure of DNA is the same in every organism. The building blocks (monomers) you
learned about in Section 2A are identical in structure. The nitrogenous bases (adenine,
cytosine, guanine and thymine, and their complementarity) that make up part of these
monomers are identical. In essence this means that the DNA of one species can be
combined with the DNA of a different species, using a range of DNA manipulation
techniques, which were explored in Section 3A.
 Nowadays, genetic engineers can create genes, and
even complete genomes for some species, by using
artificial nucleotides in a laboratory setting. They
can work backwards from the desired final protein
sequence, by looking at the specific chain of amino
acids, identifying mRNA codons that code for these
and then using stored computer software to synthesise
the DNA nucleotides. This built sequence of DNA can
then be inserted directly into a plasmid (circular piece
of DNA in prokaryotes), all without the need for a
physical DNA template.

The gene cloning process
The gene cloning process combines the use of a plasmid with some of the DNA manipulation
techniques outlined in Section 3A. The key steps of this process in relation to inserting
the human insulin gene into bacteria for insulin protein production, which is vital in the
treatment of type I diabetes (T1D), are outlined in Figure 3B–8. If you studied Unit 1
Biology, you will already know that this disorder results from the cells that produce insulin,
beta cells in the pancreas, being targeted for destruction by the immune system. This is
known as an autoimmune disease. You will learn more about these types of diseases in
Section 7D.
Insulin is a vital protein-based hormone, responsible for controlling blood glucose levels by
reducing the concentration of blood glucose when it becomes too high. The process of gene
cloning (outlined in Figure 3B–8) is a way of mass-producing insulin for people with T1D.

100 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
Cloning the human insulin genes for treating type I diabetes
Two genes express the two distinct polypeptide chains that form human insulin. Steps 1-6 are done twice, once for
each gene, in different bacterial cultures. The two polypeptide chains are combined in Step 7 to form insulin.
Step 1: Opening up the plasmid
 Plasmid is cut with the specific restriction enzyme. This makes the initially circular DNA temporarily linear.
Antibiotic
resistance gene
Restriction
enzyme cuts ‘Sticky’ ends

produces sticky ends
Step 2: Isolating the gene of interest
Gene of interest (the DNA coding for the insulin protein) is cut using a specific restriction enzyme.

Restriction enzymes Any introns in this area are
also removed in this step
Insulin gene
Sticky end Sticky end
If the restriction enzyme in step 1 was one that resulted in ‘sticky end’ fragments, then the same restriction
enzyme must be used to cut the gene of interest as well. The ‘sticky ends’ must be complementary.
If the restriction enzyme was one that resulted in ‘blunt end’ fragments, any other blunt end restriction enzyme
may be used.
Step 3: Recombinant plasmids
The plasmid and gene of interest and β-galactosidase gene are mixed together with the enzyme DNA ligase which
joins them with phosphodiester bonds. This results in a closed circular piece of DNA again. This is called the
recombinant plasmid, as it has ‘recombined’ with a piece of foreign DNA.

Note: At this step it is common for the circular plasmid to re-join to itself with the help of DNA ligase, therefore
without taking up the gene of interest. This is referred to as a non-recombinant plasmid. The β-galactosidase
gene is taken up in recombinant plasmids as a marker for them, detected by a simple test.

Bacterial reproduction (binary fission) results in

parent cell (this process occurs every 20 minutes,
doubling the number of cells each time – and
the number of plasmids increases even more,
as they replicate independently of the bacterial
reproduction). The insulin and marker genes are
expressed, producing fused insulin polypeptide

Step 6: Identifying bacteria with the recombinant plasmid
The traditional method of doing
this step is to use the antibiotic

have taken up the recombinant
plasmid) from untransformed
bacteria (those that have not taken
up the recombinant plasmid).

with antibiotic
The bacteria are spread onto a
nutrient agar plate containing an antibiotic . Only those transformed bacteria that contain
the gene for antibiotic resistance are able to survive. Untransformed bacteria, which have
no plasmid, and therefore no antibiotic resistance gene, do not survive in this environment.
However, there are ethical concerns about using this technique. As the bacteria are able
to transfer plasmids between each other, and even to other species of bacteria (bacterial
conjugation), it is possible that this may result in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, possibly creating a ‘superbug’.
Another method of identifying bacteria with the recombinant plasmid is a test for the β-galactosidase protein made
by the marker gene. As in this example, the two methods may be used together.

the growth of bacteria;
an example is penicillin
Step 7: Extracting, purifying and combining the insulin polypeptides
Steps 1-6 have been performed twice in separate bacterial cultures to
produce a polypeptide from each of the two insulin genes. The two types
of polypeptide are separated from the β-galactosidase protein, purified,
and then combined together to produce functional insulin, ready to
provide to diabetic patients.

Implications of gene cloning
Ethical
The use of bacteria for gene cloning has overcome the ethical and animal welfare issues
associated with extracting proteins, like insulin, from animals such as pigs and cattle, or
from the cells of human donors. However, some people view the transfer of genes from one
species to another as unethical, regardless of the overall benefit it could provide to society.
Social
There are many advantages of gene cloning for society, including:
• reduced cost of therapeutics made with bacteria, providing greater access to treatments
for more individuals in the community
• the creation of employment opportunities in the biotechnology industry, as well as
marketing and sales of these products.
A potential disadvantage of gene cloning is its misuse for non-therapeutic purposes, such as
creating performance-enhancing drugs, giving athletes an unfair advantage in competitions.
Economic
An economic advantage of using bacteria for gene cloning is that it has made the
production of therapeutics, like insulin for diabetics, relatively cheap – large quantities can
be produced, with a reliable (constant) supply. However, it is still important to note that
this benefit depends on the country and the socioeconomic background of the individual.
Biological
Inserting human genes into plasmids, creating a recombinant plasmid, and performing
genetic transformation to make copies of proteins to give to patients, provides a purer or
more effective product than using proteins purified from animals. This has made new and
safer treatments for disorders and the development of vaccines possible. It also reduces the
chances of side effects or of transmitting diseases. The use of vaccines reduces the number
of deaths from diseases, and this contributes to an increase in the average life expectancy
of the population. This results in the birth rate increasing more than the death rate, and
the increase in the world’s population increases the strain on the environment and affects
other species that share our ecosystems. In the long term, this changes the course of natural
selection and our evolution.
The risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (superbugs) developing has already been outlined.
Such a development would be very difficult to overcome. This is covered in more detail in
Section 9C.

3B SKILLS
Gene cloning over PCR?
Through all the steps of gene cloning, you might have asked, ‘Why doesn’t the scientist just
isolate the insulin gene of interest and then use PCR to amplify this section of DNA?’
The answer is threefold.
1 While PCR makes copies of DNA, genetic engineers need to know that this insulin
gene can be converted into a fully functioning protein. For this to occur, there must
be a set-up in which protein synthesis can take place, and this requires the different
types of RNA and ribosomes that you learned about in Section 2C.
2 Bacteria reproduce by binary fission every 20 minutes – this means that every
20 minutes, the number of bacteria doubles. Even within this time, plasmids replicate
independently of the bacteria. Therefore, even more plasmids, and therefore copies of
the insulin gene, can be produced in every reproductive cell cycle.
3 PCR requires a number of expensive ingredients: samples of the four nucleotides, a
heat-resistant enzyme, and forward and reverse primers. In comparison, the use of
restriction enzymes and bacteria, like E. coli, is inexpensive.
Determining whether transformed bacteria have taken up the recombinant or
non-recombinant plasmid
The advantage of plasmids is that they usually contain, or can be constructed to contain,
genes that code for antibiotic resistance. This gives bacteria with that plasmid a survival
advantage in the presence of the antibiotic that they have resistance to.
Common examination questions in this topic involve how the transformed bacteria are
identified. To determine which bacteria are transformed, the bacteria are grown on agar
nutrient plates containing an antibiotic (e.g. ampicillin). The recombinant plasmid that
has been taken up by transformed bacteria has a gene for resistance. It is important to
recall here that it is also possible for transformed bacteria that contain a non-recombinant
plasmid (without the gene of interest) to survive, as they still contain the antibiotic-
resistance gene. This is shown in Figure 3B–9.

104 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
Figure 3 B–9 shows that three types of bacteria are possible after genetic transformation:
• containing no plasmid (very common)
• containing the non-recombinant plasmid
• containing the recombinant plasmid.
If all three types of bacteria are grown on an agar plate containing antibiotic, both types
of transformed bacteria will survive and reproduce. So how can a scientist work out
which bacteria contain the recombinant plasmid and which contain the non-recombinant
plasmid?
Hopefully you have worked out that the plasmids could be isolated from the bacteria
and run on gel electrophoresis. Th e recombinant plasmids with the foreign DNA inserted
should be larger than the non-recombinant plasmids without the foreign DNA. Th is is
shown in Figure 3 B–10.

Answering questions about ethical and social implications
As mentioned in this chapter, when discussing the implications of gene cloning, it is
crucial to identify the stakeholder. Th e following question from the 2019 VCAA Biology
exam highlights this.

Question:
The Genomics Health Futures Mission will run a $32 million trial, starting in 2019, to
screen over 10 000 couples who are in early pregnancy or who are planning to have a
baby. Using a blood test, individuals will be screened for over 500 severe or deadly
gene mutations.
Couples will be told they have a genetic mutation if both individuals in the couple
carry the same mutation. The trial may lead to a population-wide carrier screening
program. The researchers will evaluate cost effectiveness, psychological impact, ethics
and barriers to screening. It is anticipated that future tests will be free of charge.
The test may find that a couple who were planning to have a baby or who were
already pregnant both carry the same severe or deadly mutation.
Describe one ethical and one social issue/implication that could arise from this finding.
For this question, the stakeholder is the couple. Many answers would focus on the child
as the stakeholder or the future impact on the child, but the question clearly asks for the
implication that arises from this finding. The table below shows answers that would be
acceptable or not acceptable, for each implication.
Answer:
Ethical:
Acceptable answers Unacceptable answers
Possible termination of the foetus Child is given up for adoption.
(Wrong, as the couple is only planning or
already pregnant but have not had the child)
Should a severely affected child,
who may suffer, be born?
The child may live a poor-quality life.
(Again, the child is not born yet)
Should alternative reproductive
therapies (like IVF) be accessed?
Issues for the child in knowing they have the
gene for the disease, as they did not give
consent for the test.
(Wrong, as this is not directly related to the
parents finding out this information.)
Who else has access to the
information from this finding?
What if insurance companies refuse to provide
life insurance to this individual in the future, if
they carry this disease-related gene?
(Wrong, as the gene in question would cause
health effects in the child, not the parents.)

Expensive process; parents might not be able

(The question stated that this cost was paid for

It is important to practise answering these types of questions. Examples of questions
from the perspective of different stakeholders are provided at the end of this section and
in the chapter review and digital questions.
Linking ideas in a sequential nature
When answering questions, you should do so in a sequential way, although this isn’t
always easy. It can require you to change the way you think about what is happening.
Answering questions in this way helps the examiner see what you are thinking, and to
identify that you know your content and are able to link ideas together.
Let’s look at how to approach a question of this nature.
Question:
Explain the different types of enzymes used in the process of gene cloning. (2 marks)
Answer:
• To open up the plasmid and isolate the foreign DNA from an organism, the
strands need to be cut with restriction enzymes. These are enzymes that identify a
specific recognition site and cut the DNA at the sugar–phosphate backbone of the
two strands.
• For the plasmid and foreign DNA to be joined together, they may need to be cut
with the same restriction enzyme that produces complementary sticky ends.
• To join the two pieces of DNA together, the enzyme DNA ligase is used. This
enzyme works in the opposite way to a restriction enzyme, as a ‘glue’ joining
nucleotides at the sugar–phosphate backbone.

ENGAGE
The evolution of genetically modified organisms
Genetic modification really took off in 1973 when two scientists, Stanley Cohen and
Herbert Boyer, successfully removed an antibiotic resistance gene from one species of
bacteria (donor) and placed it into another species of bacteria (recipient). The recipient
bacteria then demonstrated antibiotic resistance.
You might think this is where the story begins, but humans have actually been ‘modifying’
organisms for thousands of years. As far back as 30 000 BC, humans were changing the
DNA of a particular species through the process of selective breeding, also referred to as
artificial selection, which you will learn more about in Chapter 9. What was this species? It
is one you are familiar with, if you look around when you go for a walk, watch TV or visit
a pet store: dogs! Our ancestors domesticated wild wolves in Eastern Asia and selectively
bred individuals to produce offspring that were initially more passive and compliant.
From there, and over thousands of
years, everything from hair length,
body shape and size, to colour, has
been selected for, resulting in the
many breeds that exist today. The
difference between selective breeding
and the current method of genetic
modification is that the process is
now much faster and does not require
many generations to pass before
change is noticeable.
With the rise of genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) and the
accompanying interest in them,
various stakeholders have expressed
their concerns about the implications,
for our own health and, more broadly,
that of the world’s ecosystems. As a
result, regulation of experiments and
appropriate safety measures have been
established for researchers, who also
educate others in the broader scientific
community about the significance of
their findings.

EXPLAIN
Genetically modified vs transgenically modified organisms
As discussed in Section 3B, genetic engineering involves the transfer of DNA from one
organism to another, resulting in recombinant DNA. If the recipient organism has had its
own genome modified (e.g. genes being switched on or off), or contains DNA from a donor
of the same species, then it is referred to as a genetically modified organism (GMO). However,
if the recipient organism contains DNA from a different species, then it is referred to as
a transgenically modified organism (TMO) (trans = across, genic = gene), or transgenic. The
bacteria used in the process of gene cloning for the human insulin gene (in Section 3B)
would be referred to as both genetically modified (their DNA has been manipulated) and
transgenic (they contain human DNA).

Increasing crop productivity
Making photosynthesis more efficient
When plants undergo photosynthesis, the process is not 100% efficient, as you will learn
in Section 5E. The process generates by-products that are damaging to the cellular
components that convert light into chemical energy, and increasing global temperatures are
causing this to occur more regularly.
Normally when chlorophyll in the grana of chloroplasts absorbs light, water is split,
creating oxygen, hydrogen ions and electrons. The electrons help to power photosynthesis.
However, heat can damage a key protein, D1, involved in this process. As such, scientists
have genetically modified plants, such as the mustard plant, tobacco and rice, to better
repair the damage caused by heat.
As you learned in Section 2B, DNA codes for proteins. In plant cells, DNA is located in
the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Chloroplast DNA codes for proteins that are
used by the chloroplast, like the D1 protein that is affected by heat. The issue with the
chloroplast DNA is that it is much harder to modify than nuclear DNA. Scientists have
removed the gene coding for this protein using restriction enzymes, combined it with a
section of DNA that is activated during ‘heat stress’ and moved it into the nucleus.
The result observed
in the mustard plant,
Arabidopsis thaliana,
was that it survived
extreme heat (41°C)
in the laboratory for 8
hours. Other studies with
the mustard plant saw an
80% increase in plant
biomass.

consecutive days. The transgenic crops yielded 8–10% more grain than normal plants. Even
at normal temperatures, the yield of the transgenic rice crops was 20% higher. As rice is a
staple worldwide, particularly in low-income countries, this increase in yield could help to
feed growing populations in a world of continually increasing global temperatures.

Increasing vitamin content: Golden Rice
As previously mentioned, rice plants have been
genetically modified over the past two decades. This
began in 2000, when scientists genetically engineered
rice, producing what they called Golden Rice as a way
to combat vitamin A deficiency, which kills over half a
million people each year.
This strain of rice was transgenically modified when
two genes, one from a daffodil and one from the
bacterium Pantoea ananatis, were inserted. The genes
result in the production of beta-carotene, which gives
the rice its distinctive yellow colour (hence the name
Golden Rice). Beta-carotene is also found in carrots,
Figure 3C–5 Comparison of GMO Golden Rice with
‘normal’ or standard rice
and when consumed by humans it is converted into
vitamin A. As rice is a relatively cheap staple food, especially in developing countries, this
transgenically modified (TMO) rice helps to reduce the number of people suffering from
vitamin A deficiency. The added advantage of Golden Rice is that research has proved that
these crops are unlikely to cross-pollinate unmodified crops, as rice crops usually self-
pollinate. And, unlike many other modified crops, the seeds can be re-planted season after
season, making it relatively cheap for farmers.

Improving disease resistance
Effect of fungus on wheat production
A disease known as wheat scab, caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum, has a huge
impact on the production of wheat and barley. The disease causes the grain to shrivel and
reduces the yield of these plants. The fungus also releases a toxin that remains in grain
destined for food consumption. If this toxin is in high concentrations, it can harm humans
and animals. Therefore, in many countries, these infected grains must be discarded.

which causes wheat scab. It can affect single (left) or multiple

As you will learn in Section 6B, fungal infections can be treated by spraying the plants
with chemicals, known as fungicides. However, the pathogen infects plants during winter,
meaning that rain can wash the fungicide away.
Scientists discovered a gene, called Fhb7, in a wild species related to wheat. This gene codes
for an enzyme, glutathione S-transferase, which is able to destroy trichothecenes (toxins
released by the fungus). This allows the continual reproduction of wheat that has Fusarium
resistance. The Fhb7 gene was thought to have originated from a fungus that normally lives
inside wild wheatgrass but does not cause disease, as the plant and the fungus exist together
in a mutual symbiotic relationship. At some point, the fungal DNA managed to combine
with the wheatgrass DNA, and is now incorporated into the wheatgrass genome. As you
learned in Section 3B, it is normally bacteria that are associated with the transfer of genes
between species of animals and plants – this was one of few examples of a fungus taking
this role.
Experiments highlighted the fact that adding the Fhb7 gene to wheat did not have any
negative effects on the grain’s yield and provided the wheat with some resistance to
fungal toxins.

Implications of genetically modifying plants
Below are outlined the types of implications, and examples of each, that need to be
considered when genetically modifying plants for increased crop productivity and/or
improved resistance to disease.
Ethical implications
Some of the major ethical implications raised by the use of GMOs
and TMOs are listed below. Note that most of these are negative
implications.
• Many individuals or groups consider the manipulation of any
organism’s genetic information to be unnatural.
• Is the consumption of genetically modified (GM) plants safe
for humans? Has there been enough research to prove whether
there are short- or long-term impacts on an individual’s health?
• If cross-pollination occurs between GM crops and non-GM
crops growing nearby, then the farmers of the non-GM crops
cannot claim that their crops are GM free. Also, the patents for
those GM crops could be owned by companies.
• Large biotechnology companies generally control the
production and distribution of GM seeds. Some GM seeds
become unviable (that is, they will not germinate) after just
one generation, which means farmers have to continually
re-purchase seeds, which can be expensive. Therefore,
although the rewards of increased crop yield and reduced
disease are potentially great, much of the farmer’s profit is
Figure 3C–8 A farmer in the United States
fills his planter with GM corn seed.
spent on buying new seeds year after year. This can be even
more expensive if large conglomerate companies decide to increase their own profit by
raising the price of seeds. This specifically has a link to social implications.

Social/economic implications
Remember from Section 3B that social implications
are those that have an impact on not only one or
two individuals but a greater proportion of society.
Some of the major social implications (both positive
and negative) of the use of GMOs and TMOs
are listed below. Note that many of these social
implications can be linked closely to economic
implications.
• Large companies that own the patents for
GM seeds control the market and the cost
of the seeds, and not all farmers can afford
this technology. This increases the inequality
between wealthier and poorer struggling farmers.
Those who are able to afford the GM seeds
initially can grow more crops, sell more and earn
more profit to buy seeds again in future seasons.
• The reduced need to use pesticides due to GM
crops’ improved resistance to disease could put
manufacturers of these products out of business because of reduced sales.
Figure 3C–9 Protesters tear up GM canola plants in 2002 at
a demonstration against GM crops at a farm in England. The
farm is being used as a government test bed for GM crops,
which the protesters say will pollute the environment with
GM pollen. Eighty protesters trespassed on the farm and tore
up the plants, before being arrested.

116 CHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
• Improved crop yield for plants such as rice and wheat could help to reduce malnutrition
and hunger, especially in low-income countries. As was seen with Golden Rice, GM food
with improved nutritional value may lead to a reduction in deficiencies (like vitamin A
deficiency), resulting in healthier populations.
• Plants that have been genetically modified to grow in harsher conditions due to climate
change could also help to reduce malnutrition in some countries.
• Giving consumers a choice as to whether they buy GM foods is becoming increasingly
important. (For example, the organic food industry has become very big in Western
countries.) This makes correct labelling of products as ‘GM’ or ‘GM free’ crucial, and has
been legislated in Australia.
Biological implications
Any unnatural (or natural) change to an organism’s genetic material that changes the way
it behaves has the potential to affect other living organisms in the same ecosystem. These
effects can be positive or negative. Some of the biological implications of GMO and TMO
plants are listed below.
• As GM crops can result in increased growth and yield of plants, less space is required for
growth. This means less land is cleared for farming, which reduces the loss of habitat for
other organisms.
• A reduction in the use of insecticides or pesticides means less of these chemicals flowing
into rivers and streams, and therefore less impact on aquatic life or other organisms that
drink this water (including humans, in some countries).
• Increased planting of GM crops could lead to loss of biodiversity, as the genomes
of GM crops are identical (or very similar). If selection pressures such as disease or
environmental changes occur, the lack of variation in the plant species could mean a
drastically reduced survival rate for the crop, resulting in shortages in the food supply for
a community or population.
• The genes from GM crops could be inadvertently transferred to another plant of the
same (or very similar) species that is not GM, via cross-pollination caused by insects or
wind. This links back to the ethical implications mentioned previously.
NOTE
It is important to be aware that much of the work in genetic modification has been conducted on,
and is established with, animals. This includes the benefits of the production of increased supply
of food (e.g. milk) and resources (e.g. wool). This is not covered in this text, as the curriculum only
requires you to focus on genetically modified organisms relating to increased agricultural yield

Identifying important information in questions
Assessment questions about genetically modified and transgenically modified organisms
will not require you to know a specific example. Essentially, information about a GM
crop and whether it increases crop yield or provides increased resistance to disease will
be given in the question.
Questions will tend to focus on any (or all) of the following information, which you have
already learned in Chapter 3:
• Whether the organism is a GMO or TMO (or both)

• The advantages (or disadvantages) of the GMO or TMO for humans, animals,
insects, other plants, and so on
• The DNA manipulation techniques that may have been used in the development of
the GMO or TMO
• The biological, ethical or social implications of using this GMO or TMO, from the
perspectives of different stakeholders.
The following example is from the 2018 VCAA Exam.
Should we grow GM crops?
by Mary Nugyen
More than 25 years after genetically modified (GM) food first appeared, growing
GM crops remains a hotly debated topic. Some people argue that GM crops are
the only way to feed the growing world population and to minimise environmental
harm. Other people express different views.
Bt cotton is a type of cotton that contains two genes from a soil bacterium, Bacillus
thuringiensis, enabling it to produce insect-resistant proteins. Australian farmers of
Bt cotton use only 15% of the quantity of the insecticide that was once needed to
protect their cotton crops. However, Bt cotton is not as resistant to the main insect
pest of cotton crops, Helicoverpa, as it has been in the past.
In Australia, Bt cotton is picked by machine, but in India, it is picked by hand.
Workers in India have developed skin allergies, which have been attributed to Bt
cotton proteins.
Traditionally, farmers have saved money by keeping seed from one year’s crop
to plant the following year. However, it is illegal for farmers to keep Bt cotton
seeds because these seeds have been declared the legal property of the company
Monsanto. Every year, cotton farmers must buy more seeds from Monsanto.
Unlike Monsanto, the company that produces the GM food crop Golden Rice
allows farmers to replant the rice they harvested the previous year. By inserting a
gene from the bacterium Erwinia uredovora and another from a daffodil, Narcissus
pseudonarcissus, into white rice, scientists produced Golden Rice – a rice variety
containing higher levels of vitamin A. People who eat Golden Rice avoid vitamin A
deficiency. Trials conducted in several countries have shown that Golden Rice is safe
to eat.
Here is a question that followed this information.
Question:
Using information from the article, complete the table below by describing one social
and one biological implication relevant to the use of Bt cotton and Golden Rice. The
same implication should not be used twice.
To develop your answer, use a highlighter (or different colours, as shown in this

Bt cotton Illegal for farmers to keep Bt cotton
seeds, so every year, cotton farmers must
buy more seeds from Monsanto, which
is expensive. Could also impact other

2 The soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens is known to naturally infect plant cells,
causing crown gall disease. This is because it carries a plasmid containing genes that
cause the growth of a tumour. However, a recombinant plasmid can be inserted into
the bacterium that carries a desired gene, but lacks the tumour growth gene. The plant
cells are then mixed with the bacteria and the transformed bacteria infect the plant
cells. These plant cells are then allowed to grow in a nutrient agar and healthy plants are
produced from the plant mass. A diagram of this is shown below.

Gene editing to improve adaptability
The ability to change an organism’s DNA through genetic modification (as discussed
in Section 3C) could be of huge benefit to the international fishery industry. These
changes could allow the Australian fishery industry to avoid time-consuming and costly
GM regulations as set by the country’s jurisdictions, because the slight DNA changes
involved result in variations that could occur naturally within a population. As you will
see in Section 9B, this variation in a species could make it more adaptable to changes in
selection pressures, such as disease or drought. This would allow the industry to plan
productively for a world experiencing rapid climate change and growing population.
One of the newest forms of gene editing technology is CRISPR-Cas9, which targets
a specific location on a gene and inserts, deletes or replaces DNA at this location.
One possible application of this method is to make fish, like salmon, sterile so that
they do not spend energy reproducing and instead use their energy for rapid growth.
This technology could also be broadened to include environmental productivity, by
engineering plants to provide fish with a suitable array of nutrients, enabling further
growth. This technology could allow food industries such as fisheries to keep up with
growing population demand.

3D The futuRE of GENoME EDITING
121
EXPLAIN
Previous methods of genetic engineering
The first genome editing techniques were developed
towards the end of the 1900s. For many years, the
main technique used viruses as a way of inserting
DNA into cells or rectifying ‘mistakes’ in the DNA
of an individual. This was called gene therapy.
However, this technique was imprecise, and so there
were issues associated with it. The main concern was
that there was no control over where the DNA was
inserted. For example, it could enter in the middle of
Figure 3D–2 Gene delivery using a
viral vector to transfer DNA into a
human host is an imprecise method.
another gene in the DNA of the recipient organism
and subsequently disrupt the normal code for making that gene’s protein. That could have
dire consequences for the survival of the organism.
The ‘evolution’ of genetic engineering – CRISPR-Cas9
In 2009, a pattern of DNA now known as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeat) was discovered in bacteria, and its use as a gene editing tool began.
Breaking down the full name of CRISPR may help you to understand what it is.
• Clustered – positioned close together
• Regularly – present at particular intervals
• Interspaced – the repeated sequences have non-repeating spacers between them
• Short – measuring a small distance from end to end
• Palindromic – a word, or in this case a sequence, that reads the same forwards as it
does backwards
• Repeat – present more than once.
Therefore, CRISPR is a small sequence of a few nucleotides in DNA that is the same
forwards and backwards, repeated one after the other with spacers in between, close
together in regular intervals in a genome.
The role of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria
These sequences of DNA were discovered in E. coli bacteria in 1987. However, it was not
until 2007 that their role in defence against bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria)
was determined. CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to edit DNA in various organisms, including
humans, since around 2012.
CRISPR is a group of nucleotides that codes for short sequences of RNA. A CRISPR-
associated enzyme, called Cas9, is able to cut at a specific region of the DNA, determined by
sequences of RNA, called guide RNA (gRNA). Each gRNA contains 20 nucleotides that are
able to bind to a complementary sequence of a strand of DNA nucleotides after it unwinds
the DNA. The endonuclease, Cas9, has a recognition site for a 3-nucleotide sequence
called the PAM sequence and two active sites able to cut both strands of DNA at the sugar–
phosphate backbone, like a restriction enzyme would. The PAM sequence is not naturally
present in bacteria but is in bacteriophage viruses that insert their genome into bacteria.
Cas9 will only cut if it recognises the PAM sequence; therefore, the latter plays an essential
role in distinguishing self from non-self for bacteria.
At this point, the cell’s natural DNA repair mechanisms do one or both of the following:
• adding nucleotides that alter the sequence of DNA
• inserting a short region of DNA with a specific nucleotide sequence.

In bacteria, cutting up viral genetic material ensures that the virus can no longer replicate
and damage the bacteria. (You will learn about viruses in Section 6C.) The Cas9 enzyme
can include regions of the viral DNA by inserting them as the spacers into the CRISPR
sequence, so the bacteria have a memory of past infections by the same virus. The CRISPR
nucleotide sequence is also passed on to daughter bacterial cells when the bacteria
reproduce by binary fission, so they also have a memory of the virus.
To use the bacteria-derived CRISPR-Cas9 tool to cut the genome of an organism, single
guide RNA is created with a sequence complementary to the target of the cut, which is
adjacent to a PAM sequence. The sgRNA and Cas9 recognise the PAM sequence, enabling
the right cut to be made (Figure 3D–3).

3D THE FUTURE OF GENOME EDITING
123
The future of CRISPR-Cas9
The development of the
CRISPR-Cas9 system means
that the gRNA nucleotides can
be built artificially. Therefore, a
scientist can essentially design a
sequence to match any specific
sequence of nucleotides in DNA
and control where in another
organism’s DNA the Cas9
enzyme will cut. Unlike the use
of viruses for gene editing, as
described earlier, this technique
allows genetic engineers to
remove a faulty allele (version
of a gene) and insert a normal
functioning allele with extreme
precision, thereby giving the
organism a therapeutic benefit.

Other potential uses of CRISPR-Cas9
When scientists discovered the advantages of CRISPR, including that the process is cheap,
easy and accurate, they soon discovered how it could be reprogrammed to edit the genomes
of different species. Research in manipulating the role of CRISPR-Cas9 has included the
following breakthroughs:
• One of the two active sites of the Cas9 enzyme can be deactivated and new enzymes
added. The Cas9 then transports these enzymes to a specific DNA sequence. This means
scientists can alter a single nucleotide, so an allele that causes a disorder can be removed,
LINK
or a nucleotide that results in a stop codon being produced in mRNA transcribed from
2B THE GENETIC
CODE AND GENE
EXPRESSION
that DNA can be introduced.
• Adding transcription activators that attach
to either the Cas9 enzyme or the gRNA
and encourage RNA polymerase to
bind more readily to the DNA results
in an increased rate of transcription.
Alternatively, a gene can be silenced
by incorporating more factors that
block the action of RNA polymerase in
transcription.
• Fluorescent proteins can be added to
the Cas9, which allows scientists to
locate a specific gene in an organism’s
genome and/or follow this gene and the
chromosome it is on through cell division.
• Several diseases can be treated, including
editing cancer genes and potential for
removing HIV genes from sufferers.

As you will explore in Section 5E, CRISPR-Cas9 has demonstrated huge benefits for the
agricultural industry in editing plant genomes, for improving photosynthetic efficiency and
crop yields, and in the development of biofuels.
There have been some bioethical issues highlighted about the use of CRISPR-Cas9. In 2015,
concerns were raised by reports that this technique could be used to edit the genome of
human embryos. The ethical and social implications here are similar to those outlined in

Questions about CRISPR-Cas9
The use of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome editing tool is new content in the current Study
Design. The Study Design states that students need to know:
The function of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria and the application of this function in editing
an organism’s genome
The function of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria is immune defence against genes that viruses
inject into them to express as proteins and reproduce. A nucleotide sequence from the
virus is incorporated into the bacterium’s CRISPR sequence as a ‘memory’, so the next
time that virus is encountered, the bacterium produces gRNA, which directs Cas9 to cut
the viral gene up into pieces.
This function can be applied to genome editing in live cells in the laboratory, through
the following steps and diagram:
1 Guide RNA is created to
match the desired gene
sequence to be edited.
2 This gRNA, along with
Cas9, is injected into
the cell.
3 When the guide RNA binds
to its target gene sequence,
the active sites of the Cas9
enzyme make a precise cut
in the organism’s DNA.
4 The cell’s own DNA repair
enzymes repair the break.
5 Scientists can manipulate
the repair enzymes to
delete or disrupt the gene
at the repair site, thereby
preventing a harmful gene
from being expressed.
Or they can insert a
new sequence of DNA
nucleotides to change
a detrimental allele to a
beneficial one.

3D THE FUTURE OF GENOME EDITING
125
It is highly unlikely that an examination question would ask you to recall the steps of the
action of CRISPR-Cas9, although an internal school assessment may.
Here is an example of a question on the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in editing an organism’s
genome:
Question:
What is the advantage of using CRISPR-Cas9 over other DNA tools that are able to
cut the DNA, like restriction enzymes?
Answer:
CRISPR-Cas9 uses guide RNA (gRNA) that can be artificially designed to bind with
a specific sequence of nucleotides, enabling Cas9 to cut the DNA at a precise point,
whereas restriction enzymes cannot be guided in the same way and will cut DNA
at a recognition site that may occur anywhere along the strand. Also, gRNA is 20
nucleotides long, compared to a recognition site, which is only 4–6 nucleotides long.
So the gRNA is likely to find only one complementary site in the whole genome,
whereas there are likely to be many restriction enzyme recognition sites. The gRNA
is more specific in where it allows the Cas9 enzyme to cut the DNA, as opposed to a
restriction enzyme.
If you look back at the steps of the action of CRISPR-Cas9 above, step 3 discusses the
action of the enzyme Cas9. Other questions relating to enzyme structure and function,
the role of the active sites, what they bind to (substrate) and the specificity of these
enzymes could also be asked. Enzymes are discussed in Section 4A.
Additionally, questions about transcription (Section 2B) or mutations (Section 9A) could
also relate to this concept. Therefore, it is important to use the concept maps provided at
the beginning of each chapter and your own developed concept maps across the entire
curriculum to find as many links between content as possible. The links to other chapters

12 Identify whether the following statements are true or false in relation to transgenically
modified organisms (TMOs). If false, re-write the statement so that it is correct for TMOs.
a A sequence of DNA is inserted from a human into bacteria, using a plasmid as a vector.

 (1 mark)
13 A transgenically modified species of Bt cotton exists where two genes from the bacterium
Bacillus thuringiensis have been inserted into the cotton crop’s genome. These two genes code
for proteins that are lethal to a caterpillar that feeds on the plant, by disrupting its digestive
system. For farmers in Australia, this has reduced reliance on pesticides, which greatly reduces
the environmental impact of pesticide use, on other organisms. It has also reduced the amount
spent on pesticides by farmers. However, it is illegal for farmers to re-plant the Bt cotton seeds
in successive seasons, due to legal declarations established by the biotechnology company
that sells them to farmers. The seeds are the property of this company. The long-term cost of
buying seeds each year could be more than the farmers save on pesticides.
a What would be the likely type of vector used to insert the genes from the bacteria into the
cotton crop’s genome? (1 mark)
b Is Bt cotton a TMO or a GMO? Explain your answer. (1 mark)
c What is the role of the genes inserted from the bacterium B. thuringiensis? (1 mark)

14 d One disadvantage of the cotton industry is the amount of water required to grow cotton
crops. It has been estimated that 20 000 L of water is needed to produce a single t-shirt and
a pair of jeans. Give two reasons why the Bt cotton crop might be beneficial in reducing the
amount of water needed to grow the cotton. (1 mark)
e Globally, cotton is the most profitable non-food-related crop grown. As a result of this,
explain why the use of genetically modified Bt cotton would be an added benefit for
farmers. (2 marks)
f The current method of cotton farming and production is environmentally unsustainable,
and experts have suggested that it is not viable for long-term future cotton production.

15 16 CRISPR-Cas9 is a relatively new technique that is changing the way gene editing is done in the
laboratory and in living organisms. It relies on the use of a specific type of nucleic acid, called
guide RNA (gRNA) and an enzyme called Cas9.
a What two properties of gRNA allow it to bind to a specific sequence of DNA nucleotides?
 (2 marks)
 In order for scientists to work effectively with the gRNA that they designed, they need more
than one copy of the gRNA.
b What is the name of the technique that the scientist would use to amplify the gRNA? (1 mark)
c Outline the stages of the process you named in part b, including all ingredients required. (4
marks)
d From your knowledge of both DNA and RNA, as well as the process you outlined in part c,
identify what changes might be required to the ingredients used in the process in order to
amplify the gRNA, as opposed to the DNA that is normally amplified. e Outline one ethical, one social and one biological issue with using CRISPR-Cas9 technology
to genetically modify genes in human gametes (egg or sperm cells). (2 marks)

DNA profiling is a technique used to analyse the DNA similarities and differences between
both related and unrelated individuals for the purpose of investigations.
a What is the name of the regions of DNA that DNA profiling typically focuses on? (1 mark)
 At a football game, a mother and father accidently became separated from their son.
Coincidently, on the same day two other families also lost sight of their sons. At the end of the
match, the first couple in question located the security station at the ground to collect their
son. However, the security staff wanted to be 100% sure about which of the three children
actually belonged to the parents. For this reason, they decided to bring in the police and their
forensic science team to perform a DNA profile of each parent and the three lost children.
They investigated one region of DNA and compared the size of the DNA fragments in this
region on each of their two chromosomes containing this gene (In this hypothetical scenario
the children are biologically related to their parents). The results are shown below, for the sizes
of those DNA fragments.
DNA region Mother 3, 8 Father Lost child 1 Lost child 2 Lost child 3
‘X’ 6, 10 3, 6 10, 13 8, 10
b From these results, identify which lost child belongs to these parents. Explain your answer.
 (2 marks)
c Based on your answer to part b and your knowledge of DNA profiling, what should the
forensic scientists have done differently? (1 mark)
d The method used to generate results in this test was digital. Another technique that could
have been used to identify these different-sized fragments of DNA was gel electrophoresis.
Draw a fully labelled gel that includes:
• all results for individuals shown in the table above
• wells on the gel
• positive and negative electrodes, including the direction of DNA movement
• a DNA standard that results from individuals can be compared to. (4 marks)
e Explain how the technique in your answer to part d would distinguish between different-
sized fragments of DNA. In your answer, explain how the material the DNA separates on
facilitates this separation. (3 marks)

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
