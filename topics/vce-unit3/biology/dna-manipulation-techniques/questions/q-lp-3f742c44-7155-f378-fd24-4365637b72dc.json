      "correctExplanation": "Sticky ends pre-align through complementary base pairing, increasing the probability of successful ligation. Blunt ends lack this guidance, requiring random collisions in the correct orientation.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "DNA ligase cannot form bonds between blunt ends", "explanation": "DNA ligase can join blunt ends, but the reaction is less efficient due to the lack of overhangs guiding alignment." },
        { "answer": "Blunt ends are chemically different from sticky ends", "explanation": "The DNA backbone chemistry is the same. The difference is the absence of overhangs for alignment." },
