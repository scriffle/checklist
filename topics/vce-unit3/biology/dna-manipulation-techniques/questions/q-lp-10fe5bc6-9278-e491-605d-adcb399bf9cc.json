      "question": "At which end of the gel are the wells located where DNA samples are loaded?",
      "correct": "The negative electrode end",
      "correctExplanation": "DNA samples are loaded into wells at the negative electrode end because DNA is negatively charged (due to phosphate groups) and will migrate toward the positive electrode when the electric field is applied.",

    {
      "type": "MC",
      "question": "Why does DNA migrate toward the positive electrode during gel electrophoresis?",
      "correct": "DNA has a negative charge due to its phosphate groups",
      "correctExplanation": "The phosphate groups in the DNA backbone carry a negative charge. Since opposite charges attract, negatively charged DNA migrates toward the positive electrode when an electric field is applied.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "DNA has a positive charge due to its sugar groups", "explanation": "DNA carries a negative charge from its phosphate groups, not a positive charge. This negative charge causes migration toward the positive electrode." },
        { "answer": "The agarose gel pushes DNA toward the positive end", "explanation": "The gel acts as a molecular sieve but does not push DNA. DNA moves toward the positive electrode due to its own negative charge." },
        { "answer": "Gravity pulls DNA toward the positive electrode", "explanation": "DNA migration is driven by the electric field, not gravity. The negative charge on DNA causes it to move toward the positive electrode." }

      "correct": "Loading dye adds density so samples sink into the wells and provides visible tracking dyes to monitor electrophoresis progress",

      "correct": "The 3000 bp fragment would be closer to the well",
      "correctExplanation": "Larger fragments move more slowly through the gel because they have more difficulty passing through the pores. The 3000 bp fragment would travel a shorter distance from the well than the 1000 bp fragment.",

      "correct": "DNA is stained with a fluorescent dye or ethidium bromide and viewed under UV light",
      "correctExplanation": "DNA is colourless, so after electrophoresis the gel is typically stained with a fluorescent dye that binds to DNA. When exposed to UV light, the dye fluoresces, making the bands visible.",

      "correctExplanation": "Because restriction enzymes cut at specific sequences, they produce a discrete set of fragment sizes. All fragments of the same size migrate the same distance, forming sharp bands at specific positions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The wells have a limited capacity so only some fragments enter the gel", "explanation": "Well capacity does not determine banding pattern. Discrete bands result from restriction enzymes producing fragments of defined sizes." },
        { "answer": "The gel only has certain positions where DNA can stop", "explanation": "DNA can stop at any position in the gel. Discrete bands form because restriction enzymes produce fragments of specific sizes." },

      "correct": "The DNA has been degraded, producing fragments of many random sizes that form a continuous smear",
      "correctExplanation": "When DNA is degraded (by nucleases, improper storage, or physical shearing), it breaks into fragments of random sizes rather than at specific restriction sites. These diverse-sized fragments produce a smear instead of distinct bands.",

      "correct": "All DNA fragments have the same charge-to-mass ratio, so the electric field moves them equally. Separation occurs because the gel matrix differentially slows fragments based on size",
      "correctExplanation": "DNA has a uniform charge per nucleotide, so all fragments experience the same electrical force per unit mass. The agarose gel acts as a molecular sieve, with smaller fragments navigating through pores more easily than larger ones. Size, not charge, is the basis of separation.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The statement is accurate because DNA fragments with more phosphate groups travel faster", "explanation": "More phosphate groups mean both more charge and more mass, keeping the charge-to-mass ratio constant. Separation is by size through the gel matrix." },
        { "answer": "The statement is accurate because larger fragments have more charge and travel further", "explanation": "Larger fragments do have more total charge, but they also have proportionally more mass. The uniform charge-to-mass ratio means charge alone does not separate them." },
