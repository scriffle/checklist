      "question": "What are VNTRs?",
      "correct": "Variable number tandem repeats — short DNA sequences repeated different numbers of times between individuals",
      "correctExplanation": "VNTRs are regions of non-coding DNA where a short sequence is repeated in tandem. The number of repeats varies between individuals, making VNTRs useful for DNA profiling.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Viral nucleotide transfer receptors found on cell membranes", "explanation": "VNTRs are not receptors. They are repetitive DNA sequences in non-coding regions used for identification." },

        { "answer": "Variable nucleotide triplet regions that code for amino acids", "explanation": "VNTRs do not code for amino acids. They are non-coding repetitive sequences that vary in repeat number." }

    },
    {
      "type": "MC",
      "question": "Why are non-coding regions of DNA used for DNA profiling instead of coding regions?",
      "correct": "Coding regions are highly similar between individuals, while non-coding VNTRs vary enough to create unique profiles",
      "correctExplanation": "Coding regions are conserved because they must produce functional proteins. Non-coding VNTR regions have no functional constraint, so the number of repeats can vary freely between individuals.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Coding regions are too small to be detected on a gel", "explanation": "Coding regions can be detected on gels. The issue is that they are too similar between individuals to distinguish people." },
        { "answer": "Non-coding regions are easier to extract from cells", "explanation": "Both coding and non-coding DNA are extracted together. Non-coding VNTRs are used because they vary between individuals." },
        { "answer": "Coding regions cannot be amplified by PCR", "explanation": "PCR can amplify any DNA region. Non-coding VNTRs are preferred because of their variability between individuals." }

      "question": "How many copies of each VNTR does a person have?",
      "correct": "Two copies — one allele inherited from each parent on homologous chromosomes",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "One copy, because VNTRs are found only on the X chromosome", "explanation": "VNTRs are located on various autosomes, not only on the X chromosome. Each person has two copies per VNTR region." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Siblings from the same parents", "explanation": "Non-twin siblings share about 50% of their DNA but receive different combinations of parental alleles, giving them different VNTR profiles." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The person has a genetic disorder that deleted one chromosome", "explanation": "While possible, the most common explanation is homozygosity — inheriting the same allele from both parents — which is normal." },

      "type": "MC",
      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of VNTR repeats and the size of the DNA fragment produced?",
      "correct": "More repeats produce longer fragments because each repeat adds to the total length",
      "correctExplanation": "Each tandem repeat adds a fixed number of base pairs to the fragment. A VNTR with 10 repeats of a 20 bp sequence would be 200 bp longer than a VNTR with no repeats.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "More repeats produce shorter fragments because the enzyme cuts more often", "explanation": "Restriction enzymes cut at flanking sites, not within repeats. More repeats make the fragment between the cut sites longer, not shorter." },
