      "question": "What is a DNA standard (ladder) used for in gel electrophoresis?",
      "correct": "To determine the sizes of unknown DNA fragments by comparison",
      "correctExplanation": "A DNA standard contains fragments of known sizes. By comparing how far unknown fragments have migrated relative to the standard bands, scientists can estimate the size of unknown fragments.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "To amplify the DNA samples in the gel", "explanation": "DNA amplification is done by PCR, not by the DNA standard. The standard is used as a size reference for comparison." },
        { "answer": "To stain the DNA so it becomes visible", "explanation": "DNA staining is done using fluorescent dyes, not the DNA standard. The standard provides known-size reference points." },
        { "answer": "To cut the DNA into fragments before loading", "explanation": "Cutting DNA is done by restriction enzymes. The DNA standard is a pre-made set of fragments of known sizes for comparison." }

    },
    {
      "type": "MC",
      "question": "Why must a DNA standard be run on the same gel as the unknown samples?",
      "correct": "Because conditions vary between gel runs, so the standard must experience the same conditions as the unknown samples",
      "correctExplanation": "Variations in voltage, gel concentration, temperature, and run time between different gels mean that the same fragment could migrate different distances on different gels. Running the standard alongside unknown samples ensures identical conditions for valid comparison.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because the DNA standard provides the electricity needed to run the gel", "explanation": "The electricity comes from the power supply, not the DNA standard. The standard is a size reference that must experience the same conditions as the samples." },
        { "answer": "Because the standard must physically touch the unknown DNA to measure it", "explanation": "The standard and unknown samples are in separate lanes and do not physically interact. Comparison is made visually by comparing band positions." },
        { "answer": "Because the standard would degrade if stored separately", "explanation": "DNA standards are stable when stored properly. The reason for running them on the same gel is to ensure identical electrophoresis conditions." }

      "correct": "Approximately 2000 bp",
      "correctExplanation": "If an unknown fragment has migrated the same distance as a standard fragment of known size, the unknown is approximately the same size. Migrating to the same level as the 2000 bp band indicates a size of approximately 2000 bp.",
      "distractors": [

      "question": "A researcher is studying very large DNA fragments (10,000-50,000 bp). She finds that standard gel electrophoresis does not separate these fragments well—they all cluster near the top of the gel. What modification could she make?",
      "correct": "Use a lower agarose concentration to create larger pores, or use pulsed-field gel electrophoresis designed for very large fragments",
      "correctExplanation": "Standard gel electrophoresis has limited resolution for very large fragments because they cannot pass through the pores efficiently. Lower agarose concentration increases pore size, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis alternates the electric field direction to improve separation of large fragments.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Run the gel for a shorter time to prevent the fragments from running off the gel", "explanation": "The problem is not that fragments run too far but that they all cluster together near the wells. The gel matrix needs modification, not the run time." },

      "correct": "The relationship between size and distance is logarithmic, not linear, so the arithmetic mean overestimates the size; the actual size is likely closer to 2500 bp",
      "correctExplanation": "Because migration distance is proportional to the log of fragment size, the midpoint between 2000 and 4000 bp on the gel corresponds to approximately 2800 bp (geometric mean), not 3000 bp. A fragment closer to the 2000 bp band would be even smaller.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The estimate of 3000 bp is perfectly accurate because size and distance are linearly related", "explanation": "The relationship is logarithmic, not linear. A linear assumption would overestimate the size of a fragment between two standards." },

      "correctExplanation": "A band between 500 bp and 1000 bp, closer to 1000 bp, is consistent with a fragment of approximately 800 bp. This confirms that PCR successfully amplified a product of the expected size.",
      "distractors": [

        { "answer": "The gene has mutated because it is not exactly 800 bp", "explanation": "Gel electrophoresis does not have single-base-pair resolution. A band in the 800 bp region is consistent with the expected size." },
        { "answer": "The standard must be faulty because the fragment should be exactly between the 500 and 1000 bp bands", "explanation": "Due to the logarithmic relationship, 800 bp would appear closer to the 1000 bp band, not exactly midway. This is the expected position." }

      "correct": "Because the logarithmic relationship means that doubling sizes produces more evenly spaced bands on the gel, giving better resolution across the entire size range",
      "correctExplanation": "Due to the logarithmic relationship between size and migration, bands of equally spaced sizes would cluster together at the top of the gel (large fragments) and be widely spaced at the bottom (small fragments). Doubling the sizes produces more uniform band spacing.",
