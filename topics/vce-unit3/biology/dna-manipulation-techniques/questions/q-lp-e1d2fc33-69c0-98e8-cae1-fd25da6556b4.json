      "question": "What are the three stages of one PCR cycle in the correct order?",
      "correct": "Denaturation, annealing, extension",
      "correctExplanation": "One PCR cycle consists of three stages: denaturation (separating DNA strands at 90-95°C), annealing (primers binding at 50-60°C), and extension (Taq polymerase adding nucleotides at 72°C).",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Annealing, denaturation, extension", "explanation": "The DNA must first be denatured (separated) before primers can anneal. Denaturation always comes first." },
        { "answer": "Extension, annealing, denaturation", "explanation": "Extension cannot occur before primers have annealed. The correct order is denaturation, annealing, then extension." },
        { "answer": "Transcription, translation, replication", "explanation": "These are processes of gene expression and cell division, not stages of PCR. PCR uses denaturation, annealing, and extension." }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "MC",
      "question": "What happens during the denaturation stage of PCR?",
      "correct": "Heat breaks hydrogen bonds to separate the double-stranded DNA into single strands",
      "correctExplanation": "At 90-95°C, the heat energy breaks the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs, causing the two DNA strands to separate into single strands.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Primers bind to the separated DNA strands", "explanation": "Primer binding occurs during the annealing stage at 50-60°C, not during denaturation." },
        { "answer": "Taq polymerase adds nucleotides to build new DNA strands", "explanation": "Nucleotide addition occurs during the extension stage at 72°C, not during denaturation." },
        { "answer": "The DNA template is cut by restriction enzymes", "explanation": "Restriction enzymes are not part of PCR. Denaturation uses heat to separate DNA strands." }

    },
    {
      "type": "MC",
      "question": "At what temperature does the annealing stage of PCR occur?",
      "correct": "50-60°C",
      "correctExplanation": "The annealing stage occurs at approximately 50-60°C, which is cool enough for primers to bind to their complementary sequences on the template strands but warm enough to prevent non-specific binding.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "90-95°C", "explanation": "90-95°C is the temperature for denaturation, where DNA strands are separated. Primers would not bind at this high temperature." },
        { "answer": "72°C", "explanation": "72°C is the extension temperature where Taq polymerase synthesises new DNA. Annealing requires a lower temperature." },
        { "answer": "37°C", "explanation": "37°C is optimal for human enzymes, not for PCR annealing. PCR primers typically anneal at 50-60°C." }

    },
    {
      "type": "MC",
      "question": "What does Taq polymerase do during the extension stage of PCR?",
      "correct": "It adds free nucleotides complementary to each template strand, building new DNA strands",
      "correctExplanation": "At 72°C, Taq polymerase binds to the 3' end of each primer and moves along the template strand, adding free nucleotides through complementary base pairing to synthesise new DNA strands.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It separates the two DNA strands by breaking hydrogen bonds", "explanation": "Strand separation occurs during denaturation through heat, not through enzyme action." },

        { "answer": "It joins DNA fragments together using phosphodiester bonds", "explanation": "Joining fragments is the function of DNA ligase. Taq polymerase synthesises new DNA strands from free nucleotides." }

      "correctExplanation": "Each PCR cycle doubles the number of DNA molecules. Starting with 1 template, after 1 cycle there are 2 copies because each strand serves as a template for a new complementary strand.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "4 copies", "explanation": "4 copies would be produced after 2 cycles. One cycle doubles the DNA from 1 to 2." },
        { "answer": "1 copy", "explanation": "1 copy would mean no amplification occurred. One complete PCR cycle always doubles the number of DNA molecules." },
        { "answer": "3 copies", "explanation": "PCR doubles the DNA each cycle, so the number goes from 1 to 2, not 1 to 3." }

      "correct": "At 90-95°C the hydrogen bonds needed for primer binding would immediately break; cooling to 50-60°C allows stable hydrogen bonds to form",
      "correctExplanation": "Primers bind through hydrogen bonds between complementary bases. At denaturation temperatures, these bonds would be disrupted immediately. Lowering to 50-60°C provides conditions where hydrogen bonds can form and remain stable.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Primers are destroyed at high temperatures and must be added fresh after cooling", "explanation": "Short DNA primers are relatively heat-stable and are not destroyed during denaturation. They simply cannot bind at high temperatures because hydrogen bonds are disrupted." },

        { "answer": "The DNA template changes shape at high temperatures and reverts when cooled", "explanation": "The template does not change shape; it simply separates into single strands. Cooling allows primers to form stable hydrogen bonds with these single strands." }

      "correctExplanation": "The order is essential: you cannot bind primers to double-stranded DNA, and Taq cannot extend without primers in place. Denaturation creates single-stranded templates, annealing provides starting points, and extension builds new strands.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The order does not matter; any sequence of temperatures would produce the same result", "explanation": "The order is critical. Primers cannot bind to double-stranded DNA, and Taq polymerase cannot extend without primers already bound." },
