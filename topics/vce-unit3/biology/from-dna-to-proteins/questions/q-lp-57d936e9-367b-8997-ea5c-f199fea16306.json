      "correct": "RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and separates the DNA double helix",

        { "answer": "It moves along the coding strand and copies it directly into mRNA", "explanation": "RNA polymerase reads the template strand, not the coding strand. The template strand provides the complementary sequence for mRNA synthesis." },
        { "answer": "It attaches amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain", "explanation": "Amino acid attachment occurs during translation at the ribosome. RNA polymerase builds a pre-mRNA strand from RNA nucleotides during transcription." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "RNA polymerase reaches the promoter at the other end of the gene", "explanation": "The promoter is at the start of the gene. Transcription ends at the terminator, a distinct sequence at the end of the gene." },
