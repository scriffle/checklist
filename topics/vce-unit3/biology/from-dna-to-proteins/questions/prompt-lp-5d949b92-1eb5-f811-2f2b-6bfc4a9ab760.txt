TITLE: I can define proteome and list the six main functions of proteins with examples
CODE: 2C.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
The proteome is the complete collection of proteins within an organism at a given time. The six main functions of proteins are: hormones (e.g. insulin), immunity (e.g. antibodies), transport (e.g. haemoglobin), structure (e.g. collagen), movement (e.g. actin), and enzymes (e.g. pepsin). The mnemonic HITS ME can help remember these.

WHY (importance):
The proteome reflects which genes are being expressed at any given time and varies between cell types and conditions. Understanding the diversity of protein functions shows why gene expression matters for the whole organism.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A muscle cell and a liver cell in the same person have the same genome but different proteomes. The muscle cell expresses more actin (movement protein) while the liver cell expresses more enzymes for detoxification.

SUBTOPIC: Protein Structure and Function
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the structure of amino acids, peptide bond formation, the four levels of protein structure (primary through quaternary), the proteome, protein functions, and the protein secretory pathway.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Proteins are the functional products of gene expression. Understanding how amino acids are linked, how proteins fold into functional shapes, and how they are exported from the cell connects the molecular detail of DNA to the real-world function of organisms.

TOPIC: From DNA to Proteins
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The relationship between nucleic acids and proteins, including the structure of DNA and RNA, gene expression through transcription and translation, protein structure and function, and gene regulation using the trp operon.

Introduction
Nucleic acids are one of the key building blocks of life. Since 1953, when Francis Crick, James
Watson, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin discovered the double helix structure of DNA,
we have been fascinated by DNA and how our understanding of it can help us in many aspects of
life. Indeed, think about all the ways that we now use our knowledge of DNA every day. It is a key
part of forensics, in helping identify criminals and solve crimes, or in paternity disputes. We use it
to overcome fertility problems and help couples have children. We can harness it to generate large
quantities of medical products, such as insulin. Most importantly, by coding for proteins, DNA acts
as the genetic blueprint that makes all organisms unique and allows them to function. This chapter
investigates nucleic acids and proteins, as well as the processes through which the information
contained within the genetic code is converted into proteins. It also looks at how gene expression is
regulated in cells, with a focus on a specific prokaryotic example.

ENGAGE
What are nucleic acids?
In Unit 1 Biology, you learned about factors that are essential for life. One of those
factors is the ability to store and pass on genetic material. The biomolecules that contain
all this information are known as nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are found in two forms:
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). You may have heard people
discuss nucleic acids in various ways, without realising that this was what they were
referring to. Phrases such as ‘You are a combination of your Mum and your Dad’ or
‘It’s all about genetics’ refer to the function that DNA (and nucleic acids in general)
has in our body. The concepts regarding how genetic information is passed on through
generations were discussed in more detail in Unit 2.

Understanding nucleic acids
This chapter will extend your understanding of nucleic acids as you learn about their role
in a key process within cells. In this process, shown in Figure 2A–1, organisms convert
the information contained within their genetic material (in the form of nucleic acids) into
functional molecules (in the form of proteins).

46 CHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS
Differences between DNA and RNA
DNA and RNA have many similarities. Both are made up of long strands (polymer)
of a repeating unit (monomer) made from a sugar and a phosphate group, each with a
nitrogenous base sticking out to the side. This monomer is called a nucleotide.The sugar
group of one unit joins the phosphate group of another, to form a long chain, informally
called the sugar–phosphate ‘backbone’ (Figure 2A–1).
Nucleotide
the monomer
(building block) of
nucleic acids which
are joined together
to form DNA or
RNA (polymers);
consists of
a phosphate
group, sugar and

It is important to also be able to recognise the differences between DNA and RNA. There
are three main points of distinction, which you can remember using the acronym SBS (sugar,
bases, strands):
1 Sugar: as their names indicate, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains deoxyribose
sugars, while RNA (ribonucleic acid) contains ribose sugars. As shown in Figure 2A–2,
deoxyribose has one less oxygen atom than ribose.
2 Nitrogenous bases: these are almost the same in both DNA and RNA. Both have
cytosine (C), guanine (G) and adenine (A). However, each also possesses a unique base.
In DNA, it is thymine (T). In RNA, it is uracil (U). The bases for both DNA and RNA can
be seen around the outer edges of Figure 2A–3.

Structure of DNA
DNA has probably the best known structure of any biological molecule. The double helix
is instantly recognisable as that of DNA. However, before looking at this, you first need
to understand the building blocks of DNA. Many molecules in our body, such as DNA,
carbohydrates and proteins (which will be discussed later in this chapter), are polymers.
A polymer is a molecule that is made up of many smaller, repeating units linked together.
Each of these smaller individual units is called a monomer.
Formation of the monomer
In DNA, the monomers (building blocks) are known as nucleotides. Each nucleotide
is made up of three components: a sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base.
As mentioned earlier, in DNA this nitrogenous base can be adenine (A), cytosine (C),
guanine (G) or thymine (T).
Formation of the polymer
These monomers join together to form a single strand of DNA, via phosphodiester
bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next nucleotide
(Figure 2A–4). As shown in this diagram, one end of the single strand ends with
a phosphate, and is known as the 5′ (pronounced ‘five prime’) end. The other end
finishes with a sugar, and is known as the 3′ (pronounced ‘three prime’) end.

Complementary
the term used
to describe
the fact that a
nitrogenous base
can only pair
with one other
nitrogenous
base (cytosine is
complementary
to guanine,
adenine is
complementary
to thymine)
As discussed earlier, one of the defining characteristics of DNA is that it is double-stranded.
The two strands are joined by hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogenous bases.
These nitrogenous bases cannot join randomly. Each base is only able to partner with one
other base. In DNA, the complementary base pairs are arranged as follows: adenine bonds
to thymine (A–T), and guanine bonds to cytosine (G–C). Note from Figure 2 A–5 that a
different number of hydrogen bonds holds each of the two pairs of bases together: adenine
and thymine are joined by two hydrogen bonds, whereas guanine and cytosine are joined
by three. For this reason, DNA segments that contain a higher percentage of G–C pairs are
stronger and harder to break apart.
Think about the fact that adenine always pairs with thymine, and what consequence this
has for the amount of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule. Consider whether the same
would be true for cytosine and guanine. If there are 1000 adenine and 800 cytosine bases
in a DNA molecule, how many thymine and guanine bases will there be? This feature was
known long before the structure of DNA had been worked out.

Types and structure of RNA
As you saw in Figure 2 A–1, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is the intermediate step in converting
the information coded within DNA into proteins. This process is complicated and, as such,
three types of RNA are involved, as shown in Table 2A–1. Their roles in transcription and
translation are described in detail in the next section.
Table 2A–1 The three types of RNA and their structures
Type of RNA Diagram
Messenger RNA (mRNA)
Formed through the process of transcription. This process is discussed
in more detail later in this chapter, it involves making a single-stranded
piece of RNA that is complementary to a section of DNA. mRNA is
created specifically to carry the genetic information from regions of
DNA, known as genes, to be used to synthesise proteins.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
The main component of ribosomes. As you learned in Chapter 1,
ribosomes are the organelles responsible for protein synthesis within
a cell.
Transfer RNA (tRNA)
An important molecule involved in the process of translation, which
is covered in detail later in this chapter. It has a clover-leaf shape
and is involved in delivering and linking amino acids during protein
synthesis.

Answering comparative questions
In Biology, you will often encounter questions that ask you to compare and contrast
different concepts. You might be asked to compare the different types of nucleic acids
(DNA vs RNA) or the different types of RNA (mRNA vs rRNA vs tRNA). Although
comparison questions may seem straightforward, students often don’t receive full marks
for their answer. The main reason for this is that students often interpret the question
as follows:
Question:
Compare the structures of DNA and RNA.
Interpretation:
List the differences between DNA and RNA.
A comparison question requires you to answer it in two parts. First, you have to discuss
the aspects that are similar between the two items, then you have to analyse the aspects
that are different. This is the best way to ensure that you get maximum marks for a
comparison-style question. Keep your comparisons succinct and do not repeat the
question. Let’s use the example above to look at ways to approach this type of question.
Question:
Compare the structures of DNA and RNA.
Answer – strategy 1:
Group your responses by similarities and differences.
Similarities:
• Both are made up of nucleotides containing a sugar, a phosphate and a
nitrogenous base.
Differences (make it clear that there is a comparison, by using terms such as
‘whereas’, ‘although’, ‘in contrast’ and ‘unlike’):
• DNA has thymine, whereas RNA has uracil.
• DNA is double stranded, whereas RNA is single stranded.
• DNA has deoxyribose sugar, whereas RNA has ribose.
Answer – strategy 2:
Draw a table listing key features and the responses for each item.

In a similar fashion, it is important to be specific in what you are comparing and to
answer the question appropriately. In the 2019 VCAA Biology exam short-answer
section, there was a question that asked students to identify the differences between the
monomers of two provided images. Unfortunately, many students ignored the request
to identify the differences between the monomers, and just identified the differences
between the molecules themselves. As further practice, it would be a good idea to
attempt this question, using the strategies described above.

A small piece of the puzzle
When researchers completed the Human Genome Project, it was a huge step forward
in medical research. In particular, being able to know the genes within our DNA code
allowed greater insights into what was happening within our bodies. However, it actually
only provided a small piece of the puzzle.
As an example, imagine that you are doing an ecological study of the turtles that live on
the Great Barrier Reef.
Genome
the collection of
all of the genes
contained with
the DNA of an
organism
Figure 2B–1 A green sea turtle swimming at the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland
Concluding that turtles are found on the Great Barrier Reef would be similar to the
information we gained from identifying the human genome – that is, we know that this
exists in this location. However, if you really were studying these turtles, what kinds of
things would you be interested in? You might want to know the numbers of turtles living
on the Great Barrier Reef, and perhaps what other species they are interacting with. In
relation to our DNA, we are not so much interested in the genes themselves, but the
products they make: mRNA and proteins. In this section, we will investigate the processes
through which these molecules are made from our DNA: transcription and translation.

into the functional unit known as a protein (protein synthesis). Recall Figure 2A–1 in the
previous section for an overall picture of the information conversion process. Transcription
is the first step of protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, transcription occurs in the nucleus and
involves transforming DNA into pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). In everyday usage, the
term ‘transcription’ means the act of taking some information and writing it down – so, the
information is the code in the DNA, and it is ‘written down’ as an mRNA sequence. An mRNA
molecule can therefore be referred to as a transcript. Let’s look in detail at the steps involved.
1 Separating the double-helix strands of DNA
As you learned in Section 2A, DNA is a double-stranded molecule. The two strands are
held together by hydrogen bonds connecting the complementary base pairs.
Therefore, separating the DNA double helix requires the action of an enzyme called RNA
polymerase. For RNA polymerase to function correctly, it must first bind to a specific
region in the gene, known as the promoter. You will learn more about the specific structure
of a gene in Section 2D.
2 Copying the DNA code to create RNA
Once bound to the promoter, the RNA polymerase connects free RNA nucleotides to make
a strand of ‘pre-mRNA’ that is complementary to one of the separated strands of the DNA,
called the template strand. Calling it ‘pre-mRNA’ indicates that more processing is needed
before it becomes ‘mature’ mRNA.

Post-transcription modifications (RNA processing)
At this stage of the process, the molecule that has been created is pre-mRNA, not mature
messenger RNA (mRNA). For mRNA to be created, three processing steps have to be
completed (Figure 2B–3):
1 A 5΄ methyl cap is added to help protect it from being degraded by enzymes when it exits
the nucleus. It also helps it to be positioned correctly on the ribosome during translation.
2 A poly-A tail (a long string of adenine bases, possibly up to 300) is added to the 3΄ end.
(This also helps prevent it being broken down by enzymes in the cytoplasm.)
3 Splicing: the introns (non-coding regions) are removed from the pre-mRNA, so that all
that is left in the final mRNA is a continuous stretch of exons (coding regions).
A fourth processing step sometimes occurs, called exon rearrangement. This is where some
exons can also be spliced, leaving different exon combinations to be joined together. This
results in an increase in the variety of proteins that can be coded for by a single gene.

tRNA
Translation: mRNA to protein
Once RNA processing has been completed, the mature mRNA then exits the nucleus
through nuclear pores and travels to a ribosome. It is here, at the ribosome, that the
protein will be synthesised using the information (code) in the mRNA, through a process
called translation. In everyday use, a translation is the conversion of information from one
language into another. Here it is used to mean the conversion of the information in mRNA
into a sequence of amino acids making up a specific protein.

Figure 2B–4 The structure of transfer RNA (tRNA) with a
strand of mRNA beneath it, to which it binds as shown at
the bottom. Importantly, the tRNA’s anticodon sequence
is complementary to the codon sequence on the mRNA,
to allow for binding. The amino acid attached to this
tRNA will be specific to the codon on the mRNA.
Recall from Section 1B that ribosomes
exist in two places within the cell: as free
ribosomes in the cytosol or attached to
the rough endoplasmic reticulum. While
protein synthesis can occur in both
locations, the proteins formed serve
different purposes. Proteins synthesised
at free ribosomes are for use within
that cell, whereas those produced on
the rough endoplasmic reticulum will
be secreted to complete their function
outside the cell.
Messenger RNA binds to
ribosomes and transfer RNA
For the process to begin, the mRNA
binds to the ribosome. Once attached to
the ribosome, the other crucial molecule
involved in translation, the transfer
RNA or tRNA, is able to commence its
role. The structure of a tRNA molecule
can be seen in Figure 2B–4. There are
two key areas to focus on. First, it can be
seen that the tRNA binds to the mRNA
through three complementary bases.
The three bases found on the mRNA
are referred to as the codon, whereas
the complementary three bases on the
tRNA are called the anticodon.
At the other end of the tRNA, an amino
acid is attached. This amino acid is
specific to the codon on the mRNA.
When two tRNA molecules bind next
to each other on the mRNA, their
amino acids can be joined, and joining
many amino acids together forms the
initial structure of a protein, called the
primary structure or polypeptide chain.
Nearly all organisms share the same
genetic coding system, based on
the three nucleotide codons. This is
referred to as the universal triplet code.

Figure 2B–5 gives an
overview of translation.
In (1), the first tRNA
anticodon binds to the
mRNA codon (three bases
at a time). A second tRNA
attaches to the next codon
and there are now two
amino acids next to each
other. (In this example
MET is methionine, LYS
is lysine. In (2), the amino
acids are joined by a bond
(more detail of this is
in Section 2C). At this
point, there are two tRNA
molecules attached to the
mRNA. However, it is only
possible for two tRNA
molecules to be attached
to the mRNA at any one
time. In (3), the ribosome
slides along the mRNA
until the next codon is in
position to interact with the
third tRNA. Before this can
happen the first tRNA must
detach from the mRNA,
but must leave its amino
acid attached the next one
or the process of protein
synthesis would not work.
So the amino acid bond
must be made before it can
detach. (4) The process
repeats until a polypeptide
chain, part of a protein is
formed. The process stops
when the ribosome detects
a stop codon on the mRNA.
Figure 2B–5 Translation, which occurs at the ribosomes, is the process that leads to protein
synthesis. This simplified diagram shows the steps in synthesising a polypeptide chain that starts
with the amino acids methionine and lysine (code and amino acids not shown for subsequent steps).

Codons and the amino acids they represent
As mentioned previously, each set of three bases in the mRNA sequence represents a
codon, and the sequence of the codon determines the amino acid that will be added to that
position in the polypeptide chain. The sequences of the codons and the amino acids that
they represent can be illustrated in a codon table, as shown in Figure 2 B–6. It is important
that you know how to read this table, as questions will commonly ask you to determine
the amino acid sequence based on a given mRNA sequence. The codon table is always
provided, so you do not need to memorise this.
Use the table to find the
answer to the question:

To find the code for an amino acid, look for its name in the
table. Its codes are on the left.
Figure 2B–6 A codon table, showing the sequences of bases for codons that code for each amino acid
An important aspect of the codon table is that more than one codon sequence can result in
the same amino acid. This feature is referred to as degenerate or redundant genetic code.
While this may not seem useful, it is actually important for the survival of organisms. Can
you think why this may be the case?
The answer lies in the fact that mutations (spontaneous changes in the DNA sequence) can
occur quite frequently. Considering this, imagine that every amino acid had only one triplet
sequence that coded for it. As soon as any mutation occurred in the DNA sequence, it
would result in the amino acid sequence of the protein changing.

Altering the amino acid sequence of a protein could change its overall structure, which
could have catastrophic effects on the organism. Indeed, this is the case with sickle cell
anaemia, which results from just a single base mutation. Thankfully, due to the degenerate
genetic code, this outcome is rare. In fact, some studies have suggested that more than
99% of all mutations don’t lead to any change in the amino acid sequence. As these types
of alterations have no impact, they are referred to as ‘silent mutations’. The concept of
mutations is covered in more detail in Section 9A.

Transcription and translation in prokaryotic cells
Everything we have discussed up to this point is based on what occurs in eukaryotic cells.
These processes are very similar in prokaryotic cells, although with some differences.
Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus. Instead, their nucleic acid is contained
within the cytosol and is known as the nucleoid. For this reason, both transcription and
translation occur within the cytosol. Therefore, one of the key differences of protein
synthesis in prokaryotic cells is that there is no clear differentiation between these steps. In
fact, in prokaryotic cells, the mRNA begins to be translated even while transcription is still
ongoing. An example of this is shown in Figure 2B–7. Similarly, you can see in this diagram
that (as discussed earlier in this section), transcription in eukaryotes results in two products:
initially pre-mRNA, which then undergoes processing to make the final mature mRNA. In
prokaryotic cells, RNA processing does not occur. This makes sense when you remember
that this product of transcription is immediately and simultaneously translated into protein.

2B SKILLS
Annotating diagrams
When describing processes like transcription and translation, it can be helpful to
use diagrams. However, while these drawings can be very useful, it is important that
you annotate them concisely, accurately and appropriately. There are a number of
techniques that you can use to do this. One technique is discussed here.
A useful first step is to write a one-sentence description of what happens at each stage.
This will help you to order your thoughts and think about what your diagram needs to
represent. Also, the sentences can form the basis of the annotations that you use for each
diagram. Make your notes brief and succinct.
Let’s look at how you might do this for transcription.
Question :
Use an annotated diagram to outline the process of transcription.
First write a brief statement for each step. For example:
Step 1 RNA polymerase binds to the promoter.
Step 2 RNA polymerase unwinds the double helix and joins free RNA nucleotides to
make a complementary pre-mRNA copy of the template strand.
Step 3 RNA polymerase reaches the terminator, causing transcription to stop.
Note that technically the processing of pre-mRNA into mRNA and the exiting of the
RNA out of the nucleus are not part of transcription, so should not be included.
You can then use these steps as signposts for the series of images that you want to
create, and as the text to annotate the images. Below is an example of what you might do
for Step 1.

There are two final things to note about using diagrams and annotating them
correctly. First, you do not need to draw an impressive work of art for your diagram
to communicate your answer effectively. As shown in the diagram above, you can
use a very simple illustration that includes basic shapes for the key elements of the
process that you are drawing. Second, clearly indicate the part of your drawing that the
annotation refers to. As you can see in the example, it is very easy to use an arrow to
highlight the important part at each stage. It may be a worthwhile practice exercise for
you to now complete this process using Steps 2 and 3 as a guide.

biomacromolecules is that they are polymers, consisting of repeating units of monomers
(Figure 2C–1). In this section, you will learn more about the monomers that make up
proteins, how they lead to the structure of a protein, and how proteins are transported

Amino acids: the monomers of proteins
The building blocks (monomers) of proteins are known as amino acids. The generalised
structure of an amino acid is illustrated in Figure 2 C–2. An amino acid has two distinct
groups: an amine (–NH 2 ) group at one end, and a carboxyl (–COOH) group at the opposite
end. A carboxyl group can also be referred to as a carboxylic acid, and so the term ‘amino
acid’ is derived from these two components: amino (–NH 2 ) and acid (–COOH).

The other important feature of an amino acid is the variable group, or R group (highlighted
in green). All the amino acids are identical in all other parts of their structure – that is, they
all have exactly the same amine group (grey), hydrogen (blue) and carboxyl group (red). The
only thing that differentiates the 20 amino acids found in the body is the variable group.
Peptide bonds
Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins. For this to occur, the amino acids
need to join to each other when the polypeptide chain is synthesised during translation. This
occurs through the formation of the peptide bond.

It can be seen in Figure 2C–3 that the reaction between two amino acids leads to the loss
of water. A reaction such is this is known as a condensation reaction. It is important to note
that condensation reactions require energy, in the form of ATP, to occur. This helps explain
why mitochondria are also important for supporting protein synthesis, as they are the
site of energy release through aerobic cellular respiration. The peptide bond, highlighted
in yellow, shows the link between the carbon atom from amino acid 1 and the nitrogen
atom from amino acid 2. When looking at a polypeptide chain, it is important to be able
to identify the peptide bond, as this will help you determine the number of amino acids
present in that protein.

A gene sequence leads to a unique amino acid sequence
To understand how unique proteins are formed, it is easiest to visualise this process using
a flow chart. Figure 2C–4 illustrates how a specific gene sequence leads to a unique amino
acid sequence that is specific for the protein encoded for within the genome. However, as
seen in the next part, the actual sequence of amino acids that comprise a protein is not the

All proteins have a primary, secondary and tertiary structure. However, only certain proteins
also have a quaternary structure. An example of a protein that contains a quaternary
structure is haemoglobin, present in red blood cells and responsible for transporting oxygen
around your body. Haemoglobin is a protein that consists of four subunits (two alpha
and two beta, shown in blue and green respectively). Each of these subunits has its own
polypeptide chain, but the protein is only functional when they are all combined.

The proteome of an organism
At the start of Section 2B, we discussed the Human Genome Project and how it has
advanced our understanding of human genetics. The genome is all the genes within an
organism; similarly, the proteome is the complete collection of proteins within an organism
at at a given time. A vast number of proteins make up the proteome and they undertake a
variety of roles in the body. These functions can be grouped into key categories:
1 hormones (e.g. insulin)
2 immunity (e.g. antibodies)
3 transport (e.g. haemoglobin)
4 structure (e.g. collagen)
5 movement (e.g. actin)
6 enzymes (e.g. pepsin).

The protein secretory pathway
As you read earlier in this chapter, proteins are synthesised at ribosomes within a cell.
However, many proteins need to be able to exit the cell to perform their function. For
this to occur, the cell has developed what is known as the protein secretory pathway. This
pathway uses many of the organelles that you learned about in Unit 1 and revisited in
Section 1B. Essentially, this pathway involves the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi
apparatus and vesicles (Figure 2C–8).

Proteins are synthesised at ribosomes. You may recall that ribosomes can exist freely within
the cytoplasm, but are also found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic
reticulum plays a role in transporting proteins to the Golgi apparatus. At the Golgi
apparatus, the proteins undergo modification. The final protein products are then packaged
into secretory vesicles and transported to the plasma membrane. At this stage, the proteins
exit the cell via exocytosis, as the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane and secretes the
proteins. The proteins then complete their functions elsewhere in the organism.

Memory tools
As you will see throughout this year, Units 3 & 4 Biology requires you to remember a
lot of content. It can be very helpful to have strategies for recalling this information –
these are referred to as memory tools. One such device that can be handy is the creation
of a mnemonic. A mnemonic is a pattern of letters or associations that can help you
remember something.
The list of protein functions given earlier can be used as a mnemonic. If you look back
to the functions numbered 1–6 and take the first letter of each, you end up with
H I T S M E or ‘hits me’:

An easy way to commit this to memory is to use the phrase, ‘I almost always forget the
different functions of proteins and then it HITS ME’.
Another piece of content from this chapter that some students find difficult to
remember is which nitrogenous bases are found in DNA and RNA, and how they pair
together. A mnemonic can help you.
Step 1: Take all the words that are important to what you are trying to remember.
For example:
DNA: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine
RNA: Adenine, Uracil, Guanine, Cytosine
Step 2: Simplify this to their initials.
For example:
D, A, T, G, C
R, A, U, G, C
Step 3: Come up with a phrase using these initials.
For example:
Doing Anything Tricky Gets Confusing
Reading And Understanding Grows Confidence
In this example, notice that the phrase helps you remember that DNA contains thymine
and RNA contains uracil. Also, it ensures that the nitrogenous bases that pair together
are joined together in the phrases (that is, A to T/U and G to C).
If you find other information in this year’s course difficult to remember, try developing a
mnemonic to help you commit it to memory.

How does it all work?
In Section 2A, you learned some general facts about nucleic acids. Have you ever
stopped to think about how much genetic material you have in your body? The Human
Genome Project found that the total length of the human genome is over 3 billion base
pairs. Contained within that huge amount of information are an estimated 20 000–
25 000 genes. Remember from Section 2C that genes are the coding information used to
synthesise proteins. Recent estimations have suggested that between 80 000 and 400 000
proteins are made within the human body. Considering the complexity of this (3 billion
base pairs, 25 000 genes and more than 80 000 proteins), how does it all work without
problems arising all the time? The answer lies in the structure of genes and how it relates
to their expression. This is covered in depth in this section.

Understanding the structure of genes
To understand the structure of genes, think about the structure of your favourite book or
movie. Any good story or film has a beginning, a middle and an end. In the middle, there
are parts of the plot that are important, and sometimes there are parts that just seem to
be ‘filling in time’. In essence, the structure of genes in prokaryotic cells is the same.
Figure 2D–1 shows the overall structure of a prokaryotic gene. We will look at those
components of a gene separately and discuss the role played by each.

Promoter: the beginning of the story
In Section 2B the underlying process of going from DNA to protein was described.
Remember that, for this to occur, the gene encoding the protein must be converted from
DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA), through a process known as transcription. As you may
recall, the process of transcription starts with a promoter. The promoter is the binding site
for RNA polymerase, the enzyme that moves along the DNA template strand, producing a
complementary pre-mRNA strand.

Introns and exons: the coding region (the middle of the story)
Introns and exons are what is transcribed from the DNA into pre-mRNA during the
process of transcription ( Figure 2 D–2). Together, introns and exons form the protein
coding region of DNA. As shown in Figure 2 D–2, there is an additional step that occurs after
DNA is transcribed into pre-mRNA, which is the processing to mature mRNA (covered in
Section 2B). However, what is important to note is that the introns do not feature in the
final mRNA product. This is because introns do not actually contain any of the sequence
related to the genetic code for the protein. Int rons are the int ervening sequences (or
int erruptions) found between exons. They have previously been referred to as ‘junk DNA’,
but it is likely that they serve other purposes that we are not yet fully aware of. Ex ons, on
the other hand, contain the parts of the genetic code that will be ex pressed as a protein.

2 A sequence from the coding region of a gene is being converted to RNA. The sequence is
TAGGATCGGATCCTTGAT. What would be the sequence of the mRNA that is made

3 The coding region is made up of two distinct parts. What are they?
Terminator: the end of the story
Up to this point, our ‘story’ (the process of turning a gene into a protein) has a beginning
(promoter) and a middle (introns and exons). It also needs an ending. The end of the
process is marked by a part of the genetic sequence called the ‘terminator’.
The terminator is the sequence at the end of a gene that signals for transcription to stop.
Without the terminator, the process would continue along the DNA strand, creating a
‘never-ending story’. As you may appreciate from the discussion of protein synthesis and
protein structure earlier in this chapter, this is critically important. Extending the sequence
even just a little, or even changing a single base within an exon, can have catastrophic
consequences for the protein that is made and the organism as a whole.

Operators: the genetic ‘off-switch’
Our genetic story now has a beginning, a middle and
an end. However, one final problem still needs to be
ON
addressed. The promoter, or ‘on-switch’ of the whole
process, could theoretically restart transcription
repeatedly. This would lead to huge numbers of
mRNA copies being produced and lots of protein being
OFF
synthesised. As you may remember from Units 1 and 2
Biology, organisms keep things tightly regulated, so that
everything is kept at appropriate levels. The process of
transcription is no different.
Once the correct levels of mRNA have been produced, transcription is stopped through the
function of another sequence within genes, known as the operator. As you can see in Figure
2 D–1, the operator is found close to the promoter. The operator itself does not function
independently; it works by interacting with another protein, known as the repressor. If
the repressor is bound to the operator, RNA polymerase is blocked from binding to the
promoter and transcription cannot commence. However, if the repressor is not bound
to the operator, transcription can occur. The repressor is an example of a regulatory
protein, which is coded for by a regulatory gene. These genes and the proteins they code
for are specifically involved in altering the expression of other genes. This is different from
proteins that have a function throughout the body, such as those discussed in Section 2C,
which are known as structural proteins (coded for by structural genes).
In the next section, the regulation of transcription is discussed, using the example of the
trp operon.

Regulation: the trp operon
To help you understand how gene expression is regulated, this section examines a specific
system to highlight these mechanisms. There are many well-defined examples, but we will
focus on just one, the trp operon , which is required for this course.
The trp operon is involved in the production of tryptophan (trp), which is an amino acid
and therefore important for the synthesis of proteins. The structure of this operon is
shown in Figure 2 D–3. See also Document 2D–1 in the Interactive Textbook for details of
attenuation and hairpin loops in the trp operon.

72 CHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS
much tryptophan is available. As a general rule, resources are limited within organisms,
and as such, organisms don’t perform processes that are unnecessary. Considering this, you
could imagine that, at times when tryptophan levels are high, the organism would not want
to be producing more. On the other hand, as tryptophan is an important amino acid, when
levels become low, it is critical that more can be produced. Let’s look at both these scenarios
and see how this regulation is maintained at the genetic level.
Scenario 1: tryptophan levels are low
For each of these situations, it is useful to start by thinking about what the aim of the
organism is in the current circumstances and how it will achieve that in the context of the
trp operon. For scenario 1, this will be as follows:
Aim: To raise the levels of tryptophan by producing more.
Solution: Increase transcription of the genes necessary to produce tryptophan (that is,
those within the trp operon).
Low tryptophan:
trp repressor (inactive)
RNA polymerase

O
trpD trpC trpB trpA
PPS
trpE
Figure 2D–4 When tryptophan levels are low, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and initiates
transcription of the trp operon genes. This leads to the synthesis of tryptophan.
As you can see in Figure 2 D–4, this process involves RNA polymerase binding to the
promoter and many copies of the trpE to trpA genes being transcribed, which will then be
translated into the relevant proteins. These proteins will then help synthesise tryptophan.
Scenario 2: tryptophan levels are high
Once again, let’s start by looking at the aim and solution in this scenario, and then discuss
the mechanisms by which that solution is achieved.
Aim: To stop making tryptophan.
Solution: Stop transcription of the genes necessary to produce tryptophan (that is, those
within the trp operon).
As things stand from Scenario 1, the cell is currently producing mRNA copies of the genes
contained within the trp operon, which will lead to the synthesis of the proteins required to
make tryptophan. This is occurring because RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter of
the trp operon and transcribe the genes contained within it.
As you learned earlier in this section, the role of the operator within a gene is to be the ‘off-
switch’ for transcription, which is exactly what is required in this scenario. So how does the
operator work?
The purpose of the operator is to provide a binding site for the repressor. In this way, it works
in a very similar way to the promoter, which provides a binding site for RNA polymerase.
However, once the repressor has bound to the operator site, it prevents RNA polymerase
from binding to the promoter. In this way, the transcription of the operon is prevented.

While this may seem straightforward, it is important to recognise that the repressor protein is
present at all times. Considering this, how does an organism prevent transcription from being
stopped in scenario 1 and only stopped in scenario 2? The answer can be seen in Figure 2 D–5.
When tryptophan levels are high, tryptophan binds to the repressor, causing a change in shape
that allows it to bind to the operator. This prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the
promoter, which stops transcription and leads to a decrease in the synthesis of tryptophan.

2D SKILLS
Knowing your definitions
As you will have noticed, there are many terms in Units 3 & 4 Biology that you need to
be able to define. Indeed, almost all questions in this year’s assessments will require you
to know a definition. You may be asked directly (for example, the question specifically
asks you to define a term) or indirectly (for example, you aren’t prompted for a
definition in the question, but you are required to know it, to provide a complete and
accurate answer). Considering the importance of this skill, here are some strategies to
help enhance your ability to master this concept:
1 Separate your definitions. You will likely end up with a lot of notes by the end of the
year. Having your exact definitions mixed in with all your other content will make it
harder to learn them and easier to overlook them. Create flashcards or use an online
tool that allows you to have a specific place to store terms and their meanings, so you
can easily refer to them and learn them when needed.
2 Always clarify. There is no point making notes and accomplishing strategy 1, if the
definitions that you are writing down are inaccurate. Doing so would reinforce wrong
information whenever you study. If you have any definitions that you want to check
or are unsure of, refer to this textbook or ask your teacher. It is always better to be
sure than sorry! This also leads to strategy 3.
3 Ask the experts. Past VCAA examiner’s reports can be an effective way to find
appropriate and accurate definitions of terms that you need to know. These reports
often contain definitions that the assessors deem worthy of full marks. This is a great
way of making sure the definitions you are using are the right ones.
An example of this can be found in the 2018 examiner’s report, looking at Section B
Question 6a. The question asks for the functional difference between a structural gene
and a regulatory gene. This requires you to know the definition of a structural gene
as one that ‘codes for a protein that becomes part of the structure or function of an
organism’, whereas a ‘regulatory gene controls another gene’.

mutation has most likely occurred and what impact it has had.
7 Microarrays are technology that can be used to compare the expression of genes
between two different samples. They are often used to identify genes that may play a role
in disease. The colour of the spot on the microarray indicates the relative level of gene
expression between the two samples:
• Black indicates that the gene isn’t expressed in either sample.
• Yellow indicates that the gene is expressed at the same level in both samples.
• Green indicates that the gene is expressed at higher levels in sample 1 than in sample 2.
• Red indicates that the gene is expressed at lower levels in sample 1 than in sample 2.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can define proteome and list the six main functions of proteins with examples
CODE: 2C.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
The proteome is the complete collection of proteins within an organism at a given time. The six main functions of proteins are: hormones (e.g. insulin), immunity (e.g. antibodies), transport (e.g. haemoglobin), structure (e.g. collagen), movement (e.g. actin), and enzymes (e.g. pepsin). The mnemonic HITS ME can help remember these.

WHY (importance):
The proteome reflects which genes are being expressed at any given time and varies between cell types and conditions. Understanding the diversity of protein functions shows why gene expression matters for the whole organism.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A muscle cell and a liver cell in the same person have the same genome but different proteomes. The muscle cell expresses more actin (movement protein) while the liver cell expresses more enzymes for detoxification.

SUBTOPIC: Protein Structure and Function
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the structure of amino acids, peptide bond formation, the four levels of protein structure (primary through quaternary), the proteome, protein functions, and the protein secretory pathway.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Proteins are the functional products of gene expression. Understanding how amino acids are linked, how proteins fold into functional shapes, and how they are exported from the cell connects the molecular detail of DNA to the real-world function of organisms.

TOPIC: From DNA to Proteins
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The relationship between nucleic acids and proteins, including the structure of DNA and RNA, gene expression through transcription and translation, protein structure and function, and gene regulation using the trp operon.

Introduction
Nucleic acids are one of the key building blocks of life. Since 1953, when Francis Crick, James
Watson, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin discovered the double helix structure of DNA,
we have been fascinated by DNA and how our understanding of it can help us in many aspects of
life. Indeed, think about all the ways that we now use our knowledge of DNA every day. It is a key
part of forensics, in helping identify criminals and solve crimes, or in paternity disputes. We use it
to overcome fertility problems and help couples have children. We can harness it to generate large
quantities of medical products, such as insulin. Most importantly, by coding for proteins, DNA acts
as the genetic blueprint that makes all organisms unique and allows them to function. This chapter
investigates nucleic acids and proteins, as well as the processes through which the information
contained within the genetic code is converted into proteins. It also looks at how gene expression is
regulated in cells, with a focus on a specific prokaryotic example.

ENGAGE
What are nucleic acids?
In Unit 1 Biology, you learned about factors that are essential for life. One of those
factors is the ability to store and pass on genetic material. The biomolecules that contain
all this information are known as nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are found in two forms:
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). You may have heard people
discuss nucleic acids in various ways, without realising that this was what they were
referring to. Phrases such as ‘You are a combination of your Mum and your Dad’ or
‘It’s all about genetics’ refer to the function that DNA (and nucleic acids in general)
has in our body. The concepts regarding how genetic information is passed on through
generations were discussed in more detail in Unit 2.

Understanding nucleic acids
This chapter will extend your understanding of nucleic acids as you learn about their role
in a key process within cells. In this process, shown in Figure 2A–1, organisms convert
the information contained within their genetic material (in the form of nucleic acids) into
functional molecules (in the form of proteins).

46 CHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS
Differences between DNA and RNA
DNA and RNA have many similarities. Both are made up of long strands (polymer)
of a repeating unit (monomer) made from a sugar and a phosphate group, each with a
nitrogenous base sticking out to the side. This monomer is called a nucleotide.The sugar
group of one unit joins the phosphate group of another, to form a long chain, informally
called the sugar–phosphate ‘backbone’ (Figure 2A–1).
Nucleotide
the monomer
(building block) of
nucleic acids which
are joined together
to form DNA or
RNA (polymers);
consists of
a phosphate
group, sugar and
nitrogenous base
It is important to also be able to recognise the differences between DNA and RNA. There
are three main points of distinction, which you can remember using the acronym SBS (sugar,
bases, strands):
1 Sugar: as their names indicate, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains deoxyribose
sugars, while RNA (ribonucleic acid) contains ribose sugars. As shown in Figure 2A–2,
deoxyribose has one less oxygen atom than ribose.
2 Nitrogenous bases: these are almost the same in both DNA and RNA. Both have
cytosine (C), guanine (G) and adenine (A). However, each also possesses a unique base.
In DNA, it is thymine (T). In RNA, it is uracil (U). The bases for both DNA and RNA can
be seen around the outer edges of Figure 2A–3.

Structure of DNA
DNA has probably the best known structure of any biological molecule. The double helix
is instantly recognisable as that of DNA. However, before looking at this, you first need
to understand the building blocks of DNA. Many molecules in our body, such as DNA,
carbohydrates and proteins (which will be discussed later in this chapter), are polymers.
A polymer is a molecule that is made up of many smaller, repeating units linked together.
Each of these smaller individual units is called a monomer.
Formation of the monomer
In DNA, the monomers (building blocks) are known as nucleotides. Each nucleotide
is made up of three components: a sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base.
As mentioned earlier, in DNA this nitrogenous base can be adenine (A), cytosine (C),
guanine (G) or thymine (T).
Formation of the polymer
These monomers join together to form a single strand of DNA, via phosphodiester
bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next nucleotide
(Figure 2A–4). As shown in this diagram, one end of the single strand ends with
a phosphate, and is known as the 5′ (pronounced ‘five prime’) end. The other end
finishes with a sugar, and is known as the 3′ (pronounced ‘three prime’) end.

Complementary
the term used
to describe
the fact that a
nitrogenous base
can only pair
with one other
nitrogenous
base (cytosine is
complementary
to guanine,
adenine is
complementary
to thymine)
As discussed earlier, one of the defining characteristics of DNA is that it is double-stranded.
The two strands are joined by hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogenous bases.
These nitrogenous bases cannot join randomly. Each base is only able to partner with one
other base. In DNA, the complementary base pairs are arranged as follows: adenine bonds
to thymine (A–T), and guanine bonds to cytosine (G–C). Note from Figure 2 A–5 that a
different number of hydrogen bonds holds each of the two pairs of bases together: adenine
and thymine are joined by two hydrogen bonds, whereas guanine and cytosine are joined
by three. For this reason, DNA segments that contain a higher percentage of G–C pairs are
stronger and harder to break apart.
Think about the fact that adenine always pairs with thymine, and what consequence this
has for the amount of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule. Consider whether the same
would be true for cytosine and guanine. If there are 1000 adenine and 800 cytosine bases
in a DNA molecule, how many thymine and guanine bases will there be? This feature was
known long before the structure of DNA had been worked out.

Types and structure of RNA
As you saw in Figure 2 A–1, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is the intermediate step in converting
the information coded within DNA into proteins. This process is complicated and, as such,
three types of RNA are involved, as shown in Table 2A–1. Their roles in transcription and
translation are described in detail in the next section.
Table 2A–1 The three types of RNA and their structures
Type of RNA Diagram
Messenger RNA (mRNA)
Formed through the process of transcription. This process is discussed
in more detail later in this chapter, it involves making a single-stranded
piece of RNA that is complementary to a section of DNA. mRNA is
created specifically to carry the genetic information from regions of
DNA, known as genes, to be used to synthesise proteins.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
The main component of ribosomes. As you learned in Chapter 1,
ribosomes are the organelles responsible for protein synthesis within
a cell.
Transfer RNA (tRNA)
An important molecule involved in the process of translation, which
is covered in detail later in this chapter. It has a clover-leaf shape
and is involved in delivering and linking amino acids during protein
synthesis.

Answering comparative questions
In Biology, you will often encounter questions that ask you to compare and contrast
different concepts. You might be asked to compare the different types of nucleic acids
(DNA vs RNA) or the different types of RNA (mRNA vs rRNA vs tRNA). Although
comparison questions may seem straightforward, students often don’t receive full marks
for their answer. The main reason for this is that students often interpret the question
as follows:
Question:
Compare the structures of DNA and RNA.
Interpretation:
List the differences between DNA and RNA.
A comparison question requires you to answer it in two parts. First, you have to discuss
the aspects that are similar between the two items, then you have to analyse the aspects
that are different. This is the best way to ensure that you get maximum marks for a
comparison-style question. Keep your comparisons succinct and do not repeat the
question. Let’s use the example above to look at ways to approach this type of question.
Question:
Compare the structures of DNA and RNA.
Answer – strategy 1:
Group your responses by similarities and differences.
Similarities:
• Both are made up of nucleotides containing a sugar, a phosphate and a
nitrogenous base.
Differences (make it clear that there is a comparison, by using terms such as
‘whereas’, ‘although’, ‘in contrast’ and ‘unlike’):
• DNA has thymine, whereas RNA has uracil.
• DNA is double stranded, whereas RNA is single stranded.
• DNA has deoxyribose sugar, whereas RNA has ribose.
Answer – strategy 2:
Draw a table listing key features and the responses for each item.

In a similar fashion, it is important to be specific in what you are comparing and to
answer the question appropriately. In the 2019 VCAA Biology exam short-answer
section, there was a question that asked students to identify the differences between the
monomers of two provided images. Unfortunately, many students ignored the request
to identify the differences between the monomers, and just identified the differences
between the molecules themselves. As further practice, it would be a good idea to
attempt this question, using the strategies described above.

A small piece of the puzzle
When researchers completed the Human Genome Project, it was a huge step forward
in medical research. In particular, being able to know the genes within our DNA code
allowed greater insights into what was happening within our bodies. However, it actually
only provided a small piece of the puzzle.
As an example, imagine that you are doing an ecological study of the turtles that live on
the Great Barrier Reef.
Genome
the collection of
all of the genes
contained with
the DNA of an
organism
Figure 2B–1 A green sea turtle swimming at the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland
Concluding that turtles are found on the Great Barrier Reef would be similar to the
information we gained from identifying the human genome – that is, we know that this
exists in this location. However, if you really were studying these turtles, what kinds of
things would you be interested in? You might want to know the numbers of turtles living
on the Great Barrier Reef, and perhaps what other species they are interacting with. In
relation to our DNA, we are not so much interested in the genes themselves, but the
products they make: mRNA and proteins. In this section, we will investigate the processes
through which these molecules are made from our DNA: transcription and translation.

2B THE GENETIC CODE AND GENE EXPRESSION
53
EXPLAIN
Transcription: DNA to mRNA
Gene expression is the conversion of the genetic code within the DNA of a gene sequence
into the functional unit known as a protein (protein synthesis). Recall Figure 2A–1 in the
previous section for an overall picture of the information conversion process. Transcription
is the first step of protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, transcription occurs in the nucleus and
involves transforming DNA into pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). In everyday usage, the
term ‘transcription’ means the act of taking some information and writing it down – so, the
information is the code in the DNA, and it is ‘written down’ as an mRNA sequence. An mRNA
molecule can therefore be referred to as a transcript. Let’s look in detail at the steps involved.
1 Separating the double-helix strands of DNA
As you learned in Section 2A, DNA is a double-stranded molecule. The two strands are
held together by hydrogen bonds connecting the complementary base pairs.
Therefore, separating the DNA double helix requires the action of an enzyme called RNA
polymerase. For RNA polymerase to function correctly, it must first bind to a specific
region in the gene, known as the promoter. You will learn more about the specific structure
of a gene in Section 2D.
2 Copying the DNA code to create RNA
Once bound to the promoter, the RNA polymerase connects free RNA nucleotides to make
a strand of ‘pre-mRNA’ that is complementary to one of the separated strands of the DNA,
called the template strand. Calling it ‘pre-mRNA’ indicates that more processing is needed
before it becomes ‘mature’ mRNA.

Post-transcription modifications (RNA processing)
At this stage of the process, the molecule that has been created is pre-mRNA, not mature
messenger RNA (mRNA). For mRNA to be created, three processing steps have to be
completed (Figure 2B–3):
1 A 5΄ methyl cap is added to help protect it from being degraded by enzymes when it exits
the nucleus. It also helps it to be positioned correctly on the ribosome during translation.
2 A poly-A tail (a long string of adenine bases, possibly up to 300) is added to the 3΄ end.
(This also helps prevent it being broken down by enzymes in the cytoplasm.)
3 Splicing: the introns (non-coding regions) are removed from the pre-mRNA, so that all
that is left in the final mRNA is a continuous stretch of exons (coding regions).
A fourth processing step sometimes occurs, called exon rearrangement. This is where some
exons can also be spliced, leaving different exon combinations to be joined together. This
results in an increase in the variety of proteins that can be coded for by a single gene.

tRNA
Translation: mRNA to protein
Once RNA processing has been completed, the mature mRNA then exits the nucleus
through nuclear pores and travels to a ribosome. It is here, at the ribosome, that the
protein will be synthesised using the information (code) in the mRNA, through a process
called translation. In everyday use, a translation is the conversion of information from one
language into another. Here it is used to mean the conversion of the information in mRNA
into a sequence of amino acids making up a specific protein.

Figure 2B–4 The structure of transfer RNA (tRNA) with a
strand of mRNA beneath it, to which it binds as shown at
the bottom. Importantly, the tRNA’s anticodon sequence
is complementary to the codon sequence on the mRNA,
to allow for binding. The amino acid attached to this
tRNA will be specific to the codon on the mRNA.
Recall from Section 1B that ribosomes
exist in two places within the cell: as free
ribosomes in the cytosol or attached to
the rough endoplasmic reticulum. While
protein synthesis can occur in both
locations, the proteins formed serve
different purposes. Proteins synthesised
at free ribosomes are for use within
that cell, whereas those produced on
the rough endoplasmic reticulum will
be secreted to complete their function
outside the cell.
Messenger RNA binds to
ribosomes and transfer RNA
For the process to begin, the mRNA
binds to the ribosome. Once attached to
the ribosome, the other crucial molecule
involved in translation, the transfer
RNA or tRNA, is able to commence its
role. The structure of a tRNA molecule
can be seen in Figure 2B–4. There are
two key areas to focus on. First, it can be
seen that the tRNA binds to the mRNA
through three complementary bases.
The three bases found on the mRNA
are referred to as the codon, whereas
the complementary three bases on the
tRNA are called the anticodon.
At the other end of the tRNA, an amino
acid is attached. This amino acid is
specific to the codon on the mRNA.
When two tRNA molecules bind next
to each other on the mRNA, their
amino acids can be joined, and joining
many amino acids together forms the
initial structure of a protein, called the
primary structure or polypeptide chain.
Nearly all organisms share the same
genetic coding system, based on
the three nucleotide codons. This is
referred to as the universal triplet code.

Figure 2B–5 gives an
overview of translation.
In (1), the first tRNA
anticodon binds to the
mRNA codon (three bases
at a time). A second tRNA
attaches to the next codon
and there are now two
amino acids next to each
other. (In this example
MET is methionine, LYS
is lysine. In (2), the amino
acids are joined by a bond
(more detail of this is
in Section 2C). At this
point, there are two tRNA
molecules attached to the
mRNA. However, it is only
possible for two tRNA
molecules to be attached
to the mRNA at any one
time. In (3), the ribosome
slides along the mRNA
until the next codon is in
position to interact with the
third tRNA. Before this can
happen the first tRNA must
detach from the mRNA,
but must leave its amino
acid attached the next one
or the process of protein
synthesis would not work.
So the amino acid bond
must be made before it can
detach. (4) The process
repeats until a polypeptide
chain, part of a protein is
formed. The process stops
when the ribosome detects
a stop codon on the mRNA.
Figure 2B–5 Translation, which occurs at the ribosomes, is the process that leads to protein
synthesis. This simplified diagram shows the steps in synthesising a polypeptide chain that starts
with the amino acids methionine and lysine (code and amino acids not shown for subsequent steps).

2B THE GENETIC CODE AND GENE EXPRESSION
57
Codons and the amino acids they represent
As mentioned previously, each set of three bases in the mRNA sequence represents a
codon, and the sequence of the codon determines the amino acid that will be added to that
position in the polypeptide chain. The sequences of the codons and the amino acids that
they represent can be illustrated in a codon table, as shown in Figure 2 B–6. It is important
that you know how to read this table, as questions will commonly ask you to determine
the amino acid sequence based on a given mRNA sequence. The codon table is always
provided, so you do not need to memorise this.
Use the table to find the

To find the code for an amino acid, look for its name in the

Figure 2B–6 A codon table, showing the sequences of bases for codons that code for each amino acid
An important aspect of the codon table is that more than one codon sequence can result in
the same amino acid. This feature is referred to as degenerate or redundant genetic code.
While this may not seem useful, it is actually important for the survival of organisms. Can
you think why this may be the case?
The answer lies in the fact that mutations (spontaneous changes in the DNA sequence) can
occur quite frequently. Considering this, imagine that every amino acid had only one triplet
sequence that coded for it. As soon as any mutation occurred in the DNA sequence, it
would result in the amino acid sequence of the protein changing.

Altering the amino acid sequence of a protein could change its overall structure, which
could have catastrophic effects on the organism. Indeed, this is the case with sickle cell
anaemia, which results from just a single base mutation. Thankfully, due to the degenerate
genetic code, this outcome is rare. In fact, some studies have suggested that more than
99% of all mutations don’t lead to any change in the amino acid sequence. As these types
of alterations have no impact, they are referred to as ‘silent mutations’. The concept of
mutations is covered in more detail in Section 9A.

Transcription and translation in prokaryotic cells
Everything we have discussed up to this point is based on what occurs in eukaryotic cells.
These processes are very similar in prokaryotic cells, although with some differences.
Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus. Instead, their nucleic acid is contained
within the cytosol and is known as the nucleoid. For this reason, both transcription and
translation occur within the cytosol. Therefore, one of the key differences of protein
synthesis in prokaryotic cells is that there is no clear differentiation between these steps. In
fact, in prokaryotic cells, the mRNA begins to be translated even while transcription is still
ongoing. An example of this is shown in Figure 2B–7. Similarly, you can see in this diagram
that (as discussed earlier in this section), transcription in eukaryotes results in two products:
initially pre-mRNA, which then undergoes processing to make the final mature mRNA. In
prokaryotic cells, RNA processing does not occur. This makes sense when you remember
that this product of transcription is immediately and simultaneously translated into protein.

Annotating diagrams
When describing processes like transcription and translation, it can be helpful to
use diagrams. However, while these drawings can be very useful, it is important that
you annotate them concisely, accurately and appropriately. There are a number of
techniques that you can use to do this. One technique is discussed here.
A useful first step is to write a one-sentence description of what happens at each stage.
This will help you to order your thoughts and think about what your diagram needs to
represent. Also, the sentences can form the basis of the annotations that you use for each
diagram. Make your notes brief and succinct.
Let’s look at how you might do this for transcription.
Question :
Use an annotated diagram to outline the process of transcription.
First write a brief statement for each step. For example:
Step 1 RNA polymerase binds to the promoter.
Step 2 RNA polymerase unwinds the double helix and joins free RNA nucleotides to
make a complementary pre-mRNA copy of the template strand.
Step 3 RNA polymerase reaches the terminator, causing transcription to stop.
Note that technically the processing of pre-mRNA into mRNA and the exiting of the
RNA out of the nucleus are not part of transcription, so should not be included.
You can then use these steps as signposts for the series of images that you want to
create, and as the text to annotate the images. Below is an example of what you might do
for Step 1.

There are two final things to note about using diagrams and annotating them
correctly. First, you do not need to draw an impressive work of art for your diagram
to communicate your answer effectively. As shown in the diagram above, you can
use a very simple illustration that includes basic shapes for the key elements of the
process that you are drawing. Second, clearly indicate the part of your drawing that the
annotation refers to. As you can see in the example, it is very easy to use an arrow to
highlight the important part at each stage. It may be a worthwhile practice exercise for
you to now complete this process using Steps 2 and 3 as a guide.

Organisms contain many biomacromolecules that are critical for their function, such
as nucleic acids, carbohydrates and proteins. The structure of a gene can be likened to
the structure of a book. A book is a series of repeating pages all bound together. We
can see a similar pattern with biomacromolecules. Indeed, a common feature of many
biomacromolecules is that they are polymers, consisting of repeating units of monomers
(Figure 2C–1). In this section, you will learn more about the monomers that make up
proteins, how they lead to the structure of a protein, and how proteins are transported
out of the cell to perform their function.

Amino acids: the monomers of proteins
The building blocks (monomers) of proteins are known as amino acids. The generalised
structure of an amino acid is illustrated in Figure 2 C–2. An amino acid has two distinct
groups: an amine (–NH 2 ) group at one end, and a carboxyl (–COOH) group at the opposite
end. A carboxyl group can also be referred to as a carboxylic acid, and so the term ‘amino
acid’ is derived from these two components: amino (–NH 2 ) and acid (–COOH).

The other important feature of an amino acid is the variable group, or R group (highlighted
in green). All the amino acids are identical in all other parts of their structure – that is, they
all have exactly the same amine group (grey), hydrogen (blue) and carboxyl group (red). The
only thing that differentiates the 20 amino acids found in the body is the variable group.
Peptide bonds
Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins. For this to occur, the amino acids
need to join to each other when the polypeptide chain is synthesised during translation. This
occurs through the formation of the peptide bond.

It can be seen in Figure 2C–3 that the reaction between two amino acids leads to the loss
of water. A reaction such is this is known as a condensation reaction. It is important to note
that condensation reactions require energy, in the form of ATP, to occur. This helps explain
why mitochondria are also important for supporting protein synthesis, as they are the
site of energy release through aerobic cellular respiration. The peptide bond, highlighted
in yellow, shows the link between the carbon atom from amino acid 1 and the nitrogen
atom from amino acid 2. When looking at a polypeptide chain, it is important to be able
to identify the peptide bond, as this will help you determine the number of amino acids
present in that protein.

To understand how unique proteins are formed, it is easiest to visualise this process using
a flow chart. Figure 2C–4 illustrates how a specific gene sequence leads to a unique amino
acid sequence that is specific for the protein encoded for within the genome. However, as
seen in the next part, the actual sequence of amino acids that comprise a protein is not the

advanced our understanding of human genetics. The genome is all the genes within an
organism; similarly, the proteome is the complete collection of proteins within an organism
at at a given time. A vast number of proteins make up the proteome and they undertake a
variety of roles in the body. These functions can be grouped into key categories:
1 hormones (e.g. insulin)
2 immunity (e.g. antibodies)
3 transport (e.g. haemoglobin)
4 structure (e.g. collagen)
5 movement (e.g. actin)

The protein secretory pathway
As you read earlier in this chapter, proteins are synthesised at ribosomes within a cell.
However, many proteins need to be able to exit the cell to perform their function. For
this to occur, the cell has developed what is known as the protein secretory pathway. This
pathway uses many of the organelles that you learned about in Unit 1 and revisited in
Section 1B. Essentially, this pathway involves the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi
apparatus and vesicles (Figure 2C–8).

Proteins are synthesised at ribosomes. You may recall that ribosomes can exist freely within
the cytoplasm, but are also found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic
reticulum plays a role in transporting proteins to the Golgi apparatus. At the Golgi
apparatus, the proteins undergo modification. The final protein products are then packaged
into secretory vesicles and transported to the plasma membrane. At this stage, the proteins
exit the cell via exocytosis, as the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane and secretes the
proteins. The proteins then complete their functions elsewhere in the organism.

lot of content. It can be very helpful to have strategies for recalling this information –
these are referred to as memory tools. One such device that can be handy is the creation
of a mnemonic. A mnemonic is a pattern of letters or associations that can help you
remember something.
The list of protein functions given earlier can be used as a mnemonic. If you look back
to the functions numbered 1–6 and take the first letter of each, you end up with

An easy way to commit this to memory is to use the phrase, ‘I almost always forget the
different functions of proteins and then it HITS ME’.
Another piece of content from this chapter that some students find difficult to
remember is which nitrogenous bases are found in DNA and RNA, and how they pair
together. A mnemonic can help you.
Step 1: Take all the words that are important to what you are trying to remember.
For example:
DNA: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine
RNA: Adenine, Uracil, Guanine, Cytosine
Step 2: Simplify this to their initials.
For example:
D, A, T, G, C
R, A, U, G, C
Step 3: Come up with a phrase using these initials.
For example:
Doing Anything Tricky Gets Confusing
Reading And Understanding Grows Confidence
In this example, notice that the phrase helps you remember that DNA contains thymine
and RNA contains uracil. Also, it ensures that the nitrogenous bases that pair together
are joined together in the phrases (that is, A to T/U and G to C).
If you find other information in this year’s course difficult to remember, try developing a
mnemonic to help you commit it to memory.

How does it all work?
In Section 2A, you learned some general facts about nucleic acids. Have you ever
stopped to think about how much genetic material you have in your body? The Human
Genome Project found that the total length of the human genome is over 3 billion base
pairs. Contained within that huge amount of information are an estimated 20 000–
25 000 genes. Remember from Section 2C that genes are the coding information used to
synthesise proteins. Recent estimations have suggested that between 80 000 and 400 000
proteins are made within the human body. Considering the complexity of this (3 billion
base pairs, 25 000 genes and more than 80 000 proteins), how does it all work without
problems arising all the time? The answer lies in the structure of genes and how it relates
to their expression. This is covered in depth in this section.

To understand the structure of genes, think about the structure of your favourite book or
movie. Any good story or film has a beginning, a middle and an end. In the middle, there
are parts of the plot that are important, and sometimes there are parts that just seem to
be ‘filling in time’. In essence, the structure of genes in prokaryotic cells is the same.
Figure 2D–1 shows the overall structure of a prokaryotic gene. We will look at those

Promoter: the beginning of the story
In Section 2B the underlying process of going from DNA to protein was described.
Remember that, for this to occur, the gene encoding the protein must be converted from
DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA), through a process known as transcription. As you may
recall, the process of transcription starts with a promoter. The promoter is the binding site
for RNA polymerase, the enzyme that moves along the DNA template strand, producing a
complementary pre-mRNA strand.

Introns and exons: the coding region (the middle of the story)
Introns and exons are what is transcribed from the DNA into pre-mRNA during the
process of transcription ( Figure 2 D–2). Together, introns and exons form the protein
coding region of DNA. As shown in Figure 2 D–2, there is an additional step that occurs after
DNA is transcribed into pre-mRNA, which is the processing to mature mRNA (covered in
Section 2B). However, what is important to note is that the introns do not feature in the
final mRNA product. This is because introns do not actually contain any of the sequence
related to the genetic code for the protein. Int rons are the int ervening sequences (or
int erruptions) found between exons. They have previously been referred to as ‘junk DNA’,
but it is likely that they serve other purposes that we are not yet fully aware of. Ex ons, on
the other hand, contain the parts of the genetic code that will be ex pressed as a protein.

TAGGATCGGATCCTTGAT. What would be the sequence of the mRNA that is made

3 The coding region is made up of two distinct parts. What are they?
Terminator: the end of the story
Up to this point, our ‘story’ (the process of turning a gene into a protein) has a beginning
(promoter) and a middle (introns and exons). It also needs an ending. The end of the
process is marked by a part of the genetic sequence called the ‘terminator’.
The terminator is the sequence at the end of a gene that signals for transcription to stop.
Without the terminator, the process would continue along the DNA strand, creating a
‘never-ending story’. As you may appreciate from the discussion of protein synthesis and
protein structure earlier in this chapter, this is critically important. Extending the sequence
even just a little, or even changing a single base within an exon, can have catastrophic
consequences for the protein that is made and the organism as a whole.

Operators: the genetic ‘off-switch’
Our genetic story now has a beginning, a middle and
an end. However, one final problem still needs to be
ON
addressed. The promoter, or ‘on-switch’ of the whole
process, could theoretically restart transcription
repeatedly. This would lead to huge numbers of
mRNA copies being produced and lots of protein being
OFF
synthesised. As you may remember from Units 1 and 2
Biology, organisms keep things tightly regulated, so that
everything is kept at appropriate levels. The process of
transcription is no different.
Once the correct levels of mRNA have been produced, transcription is stopped through the
function of another sequence within genes, known as the operator. As you can see in Figure
2 D–1, the operator is found close to the promoter. The operator itself does not function
independently; it works by interacting with another protein, known as the repressor. If
the repressor is bound to the operator, RNA polymerase is blocked from binding to the
promoter and transcription cannot commence. However, if the repressor is not bound
to the operator, transcription can occur. The repressor is an example of a regulatory
protein, which is coded for by a regulatory gene. These genes and the proteins they code
for are specifically involved in altering the expression of other genes. This is different from
proteins that have a function throughout the body, such as those discussed in Section 2C,
which are known as structural proteins (coded for by structural genes).
In the next section, the regulation of transcription is discussed, using the example of the
trp operon.

To help you understand how gene expression is regulated, this section examines a specific
system to highlight these mechanisms. There are many well-defined examples, but we will
focus on just one, the trp operon , which is required for this course.
The trp operon is involved in the production of tryptophan (trp), which is an amino acid
and therefore important for the synthesis of proteins. The structure of this operon is
shown in Figure 2 D–3. See also Document 2D–1 in the Interactive Textbook for details of

much tryptophan is available. As a general rule, resources are limited within organisms,
and as such, organisms don’t perform processes that are unnecessary. Considering this, you
could imagine that, at times when tryptophan levels are high, the organism would not want
to be producing more. On the other hand, as tryptophan is an important amino acid, when
levels become low, it is critical that more can be produced. Let’s look at both these scenarios
and see how this regulation is maintained at the genetic level.
Scenario 1: tryptophan levels are low
For each of these situations, it is useful to start by thinking about what the aim of the
organism is in the current circumstances and how it will achieve that in the context of the
trp operon. For scenario 1, this will be as follows:
Aim: To raise the levels of tryptophan by producing more.
Solution: Increase transcription of the genes necessary to produce tryptophan (that is,
those within the trp operon).
Low tryptophan:
trp repressor (inactive)
RNA polymerase
Transcription
DNA
P
O
trpD trpC trpB trpA
PPS
trpE
Figure 2D–4 When tryptophan levels are low, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and initiates
transcription of the trp operon genes. This leads to the synthesis of tryptophan.
As you can see in Figure 2 D–4, this process involves RNA polymerase binding to the
promoter and many copies of the trpE to trpA genes being transcribed, which will then be
translated into the relevant proteins. These proteins will then help synthesise tryptophan.
Scenario 2: tryptophan levels are high
Once again, let’s start by looking at the aim and solution in this scenario, and then discuss
the mechanisms by which that solution is achieved.
Aim: To stop making tryptophan.
Solution: Stop transcription of the genes necessary to produce tryptophan (that is, those
within the trp operon).
As things stand from Scenario 1, the cell is currently producing mRNA copies of the genes
contained within the trp operon, which will lead to the synthesis of the proteins required to
make tryptophan. This is occurring because RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter of
the trp operon and transcribe the genes contained within it.
As you learned earlier in this section, the role of the operator within a gene is to be the ‘off-
switch’ for transcription, which is exactly what is required in this scenario. So how does the
operator work?
The purpose of the operator is to provide a binding site for the repressor. In this way, it works
in a very similar way to the promoter, which provides a binding site for RNA polymerase.
However, once the repressor has bound to the operator site, it prevents RNA polymerase
from binding to the promoter. In this way, the transcription of the operon is prevented.

2D GENE STRuCTuRE AND EXPRESSION
73
While this may seem straightforward, it is important to recognise that the repressor protein is
present at all times. Considering this, how does an organism prevent transcription from being
stopped in scenario 1 and only stopped in scenario 2? The answer can be seen in Figure 2 D–5.
When tryptophan levels are high, tryptophan binds to the repressor, causing a change in shape
that allows it to bind to the operator. This prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the
promoter, which stops transcription and leads to a decrease in the synthesis of tryptophan.
High tryptophan:

No transcription

2D SKILLS
Knowing your definitions
As you will have noticed, there are many terms in Units 3 & 4 Biology that you need to
be able to define. Indeed, almost all questions in this year’s assessments will require you
to know a definition. You may be asked directly (for example, the question specifically
asks you to define a term) or indirectly (for example, you aren’t prompted for a
definition in the question, but you are required to know it, to provide a complete and
accurate answer). Considering the importance of this skill, here are some strategies to
help enhance your ability to master this concept:
1 Separate your definitions. You will likely end up with a lot of notes by the end of the
year. Having your exact definitions mixed in with all your other content will make it
harder to learn them and easier to overlook them. Create flashcards or use an online
tool that allows you to have a specific place to store terms and their meanings, so you
can easily refer to them and learn them when needed.
2 Always clarify. There is no point making notes and accomplishing strategy 1, if the
definitions that you are writing down are inaccurate. Doing so would reinforce wrong
information whenever you study. If you have any definitions that you want to check
or are unsure of, refer to this textbook or ask your teacher. It is always better to be
sure than sorry! This also leads to strategy 3.
3 Ask the experts. Past VCAA examiner’s reports can be an effective way to find
appropriate and accurate definitions of terms that you need to know. These reports
often contain definitions that the assessors deem worthy of full marks. This is a great
way of making sure the definitions you are using are the right ones.
An example of this can be found in the 2018 examiner’s report, looking at Section B
Question 6a. The question asks for the functional difference between a structural gene
and a regulatory gene. This requires you to know the definition of a structural gene
as one that ‘codes for a protein that becomes part of the structure or function of an
organism’, whereas a ‘regulatory gene controls another gene’.

74 CHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS
Section 2D questions
1 Genes are stretches of DNA sequences that encode for what?
2 The coding region of a gene contains two components. Which component appears in
the complete mRNA after transcription?
3 What part of the genetic structure ensures that transcription ends, so that only the
genetic sequence corresponding to the protein is present in the RNA?
4 What would the likely result be if there was a genetic issue in the promoter region?
5 Draw a diagram that represents the general structure of an operon. Make sure you
include all the key components (promoter, operator, introns, exons and terminator).
6 It is important that the expression of genes is tightly regulated, so proteins are only
synthesised when necessary.
a What part of a gene regulates the amount of protein synthesised?
b What molecule binds to the part of the gene that is the answer to part a, in order to
stop gene expression?
c The molecule that is the answer to part b is coded for by what type of gene?
d Scientists identify a strain of E. coli that has a mutation in the DNA sequence of
the trp operon. Further analysis of these bacteria shows that they have abnormally
high levels of tryptophan. Use this information to explain where in the operon the
mutation has most likely occurred and what impact it has had.
7 Microarrays are technology that can be used to compare the expression of genes
between two different samples. They are often used to identify genes that may play a role
in disease. The colour of the spot on the microarray indicates the relative level of gene
expression between the two samples:
• Black indicates that the gene isn’t expressed in either sample.
• Yellow indicates that the gene is expressed at the same level in both samples.
• Green indicates that the gene is expressed at higher levels in sample 1 than in sample 2.
• Red indicates that the gene is expressed at lower levels in sample 1 than in sample 2.
The following data was obtained from a microarray. The diseased sample was sample 1
and the healthy sample was sample 2. The analysis was completed three times.
Microarray #1 Microarray #2 Microarray #3
Gene V
Gene W
Gene X
Gene Y
Gene Z
a Which gene or genes are unlikely to be involved in this disease?
b Explain your answer to part a.
c Is Gene Y likely to cause the disease or protect against it? Explain.
d What is the most likely explanation for the result for Gene Z in Microarray #3?
e What is the importance of using the healthy sample in this experiment?

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.

TITLE: I can define proteome and list the six main functions of proteins with examples
CODE: 2C.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
The proteome is the complete collection of proteins within an organism at a given time. The six main functions of proteins are: hormones (e.g. insulin), immunity (e.g. antibodies), transport (e.g. haemoglobin), structure (e.g. collagen), movement (e.g. actin), and enzymes (e.g. pepsin). The mnemonic HITS ME can help remember these.

WHY (importance):
The proteome reflects which genes are being expressed at any given time and varies between cell types and conditions. Understanding the diversity of protein functions shows why gene expression matters for the whole organism.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A muscle cell and a liver cell in the same person have the same genome but different proteomes. The muscle cell expresses more actin (movement protein) while the liver cell expresses more enzymes for detoxification.

SUBTOPIC: Protein Structure and Function
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the structure of amino acids, peptide bond formation, the four levels of protein structure (primary through quaternary), the proteome, protein functions, and the protein secretory pathway.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Proteins are the functional products of gene expression. Understanding how amino acids are linked, how proteins fold into functional shapes, and how they are exported from the cell connects the molecular detail of DNA to the real-world function of organisms.

TOPIC: From DNA to Proteins
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The relationship between nucleic acids and proteins, including the structure of DNA and RNA, gene expression through transcription and translation, protein structure and function, and gene regulation using the trp operon.

Nucleic acids as
information molecules that

a comparison of their
respective nucleotides

Introduction
Nucleic acids are one of the key building blocks of life. Since 1953, when Francis Crick, James
Watson, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin discovered the double helix structure of DNA,
we have been fascinated by DNA and how our understanding of it can help us in many aspects of
life. Indeed, think about all the ways that we now use our knowledge of DNA every day. It is a key
part of forensics, in helping identify criminals and solve crimes, or in paternity disputes. We use it
to overcome fertility problems and help couples have children. We can harness it to generate large
quantities of medical products, such as insulin. Most importantly, by coding for proteins, DNA acts
as the genetic blueprint that makes all organisms unique and allows them to function. This chapter
investigates nucleic acids and proteins, as well as the processes through which the information
contained within the genetic code is converted into proteins. It also looks at how gene expression is
regulated in cells, with a focus on a specific prokaryotic example.

What are nucleic acids?
In Unit 1 Biology, you learned about factors that are essential for life. One of those
factors is the ability to store and pass on genetic material. The biomolecules that contain
all this information are known as nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are found in two forms:
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). You may have heard people
discuss nucleic acids in various ways, without realising that this was what they were
referring to. Phrases such as ‘You are a combination of your Mum and your Dad’ or
‘It’s all about genetics’ refer to the function that DNA (and nucleic acids in general)
has in our body. The concepts regarding how genetic information is passed on through
generations were discussed in more detail in Unit 2.

Understanding nucleic acids
This chapter will extend your understanding of nucleic acids as you learn about their role
in a key process within cells. In this process, shown in Figure 2A–1, organisms convert
the information contained within their genetic material (in the form of nucleic acids) into
functional molecules (in the form of proteins).

46 CHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS
Differences between DNA and RNA
DNA and RNA have many similarities. Both are made up of long strands (polymer)
of a repeating unit (monomer) made from a sugar and a phosphate group, each with a
nitrogenous base sticking out to the side. This monomer is called a nucleotide.The sugar
group of one unit joins the phosphate group of another, to form a long chain, informally
called the sugar–phosphate ‘backbone’ (Figure 2A–1).
Nucleotide
the monomer
(building block) of
nucleic acids which
are joined together
to form DNA or
RNA (polymers);
consists of
a phosphate
group, sugar and

It is important to also be able to recognise the differences between DNA and RNA. There
are three main points of distinction, which you can remember using the acronym SBS (sugar,
bases, strands):
1 Sugar: as their names indicate, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains deoxyribose
sugars, while RNA (ribonucleic acid) contains ribose sugars. As shown in Figure 2A–2,
deoxyribose has one less oxygen atom than ribose.
2 Nitrogenous bases: these are almost the same in both DNA and RNA. Both have
cytosine (C), guanine (G) and adenine (A). However, each also possesses a unique base.
In DNA, it is thymine (T). In RNA, it is uracil (U). The bases for both DNA and RNA can
be seen around the outer edges of Figure 2A–3.

Structure of DNA
DNA has probably the best known structure of any biological molecule. The double helix
is instantly recognisable as that of DNA. However, before looking at this, you first need
to understand the building blocks of DNA. Many molecules in our body, such as DNA,
carbohydrates and proteins (which will be discussed later in this chapter), are polymers.
A polymer is a molecule that is made up of many smaller, repeating units linked together.
Each of these smaller individual units is called a monomer.
Formation of the monomer
In DNA, the monomers (building blocks) are known as nucleotides. Each nucleotide
is made up of three components: a sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base.
As mentioned earlier, in DNA this nitrogenous base can be adenine (A), cytosine (C),
guanine (G) or thymine (T).
Formation of the polymer
These monomers join together to form a single strand of DNA, via phosphodiester
bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next nucleotide
(Figure 2A–4). As shown in this diagram, one end of the single strand ends with
a phosphate, and is known as the 5′ (pronounced ‘five prime’) end. The other end
finishes with a sugar, and is known as the 3′ (pronounced ‘three prime’) end.

Complementary
the term used
to describe
the fact that a
nitrogenous base
can only pair
with one other
nitrogenous
base (cytosine is
complementary
to guanine,
adenine is
complementary
to thymine)
As discussed earlier, one of the defining characteristics of DNA is that it is double-stranded.
The two strands are joined by hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogenous bases.
These nitrogenous bases cannot join randomly. Each base is only able to partner with one
other base. In DNA, the complementary base pairs are arranged as follows: adenine bonds
to thymine (A–T), and guanine bonds to cytosine (G–C). Note from Figure 2 A–5 that a
different number of hydrogen bonds holds each of the two pairs of bases together: adenine
and thymine are joined by two hydrogen bonds, whereas guanine and cytosine are joined
by three. For this reason, DNA segments that contain a higher percentage of G–C pairs are
stronger and harder to break apart.
Think about the fact that adenine always pairs with thymine, and what consequence this
has for the amount of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule. Consider whether the same
would be true for cytosine and guanine. If there are 1000 adenine and 800 cytosine bases
in a DNA molecule, how many thymine and guanine bases will there be? This feature was
known long before the structure of DNA had been worked out.

Types and structure of RNA
As you saw in Figure 2 A–1, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is the intermediate step in converting
the information coded within DNA into proteins. This process is complicated and, as such,
three types of RNA are involved, as shown in Table 2A–1. Their roles in transcription and
translation are described in detail in the next section.
Table 2A–1 The three types of RNA and their structures
Type of RNA Diagram
Messenger RNA (mRNA)
Formed through the process of transcription. This process is discussed
in more detail later in this chapter, it involves making a single-stranded
piece of RNA that is complementary to a section of DNA. mRNA is
created specifically to carry the genetic information from regions of
DNA, known as genes, to be used to synthesise proteins.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
The main component of ribosomes. As you learned in Chapter 1,
ribosomes are the organelles responsible for protein synthesis within
a cell.
Transfer RNA (tRNA)
An important molecule involved in the process of translation, which
is covered in detail later in this chapter. It has a clover-leaf shape
and is involved in delivering and linking amino acids during protein
synthesis.

Answering comparative questions
In Biology, you will often encounter questions that ask you to compare and contrast
different concepts. You might be asked to compare the different types of nucleic acids
(DNA vs RNA) or the different types of RNA (mRNA vs rRNA vs tRNA). Although
comparison questions may seem straightforward, students often don’t receive full marks
for their answer. The main reason for this is that students often interpret the question
as follows:
Question:
Compare the structures of DNA and RNA.
Interpretation:
List the differences between DNA and RNA.
A comparison question requires you to answer it in two parts. First, you have to discuss
the aspects that are similar between the two items, then you have to analyse the aspects
that are different. This is the best way to ensure that you get maximum marks for a
comparison-style question. Keep your comparisons succinct and do not repeat the
question. Let’s use the example above to look at ways to approach this type of question.
Question:
Compare the structures of DNA and RNA.
Answer – strategy 1:
Group your responses by similarities and differences.
Similarities:
• Both are made up of nucleotides containing a sugar, a phosphate and a
nitrogenous base.
Differences (make it clear that there is a comparison, by using terms such as
‘whereas’, ‘although’, ‘in contrast’ and ‘unlike’):
• DNA has thymine, whereas RNA has uracil.
• DNA is double stranded, whereas RNA is single stranded.
• DNA has deoxyribose sugar, whereas RNA has ribose.
Answer – strategy 2:
Draw a table listing key features and the responses for each item.

In a similar fashion, it is important to be specific in what you are comparing and to
answer the question appropriately. In the 2019 VCAA Biology exam short-answer
section, there was a question that asked students to identify the differences between the
monomers of two provided images. Unfortunately, many students ignored the request
to identify the differences between the monomers, and just identified the differences
between the molecules themselves. As further practice, it would be a good idea to
attempt this question, using the strategies described above.

A small piece of the puzzle
When researchers completed the Human Genome Project, it was a huge step forward
in medical research. In particular, being able to know the genes within our DNA code
allowed greater insights into what was happening within our bodies. However, it actually
only provided a small piece of the puzzle.
As an example, imagine that you are doing an ecological study of the turtles that live on
the Great Barrier Reef.
Genome
the collection of
all of the genes
contained with
the DNA of an
organism
Figure 2B–1 A green sea turtle swimming at the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland
Concluding that turtles are found on the Great Barrier Reef would be similar to the
information we gained from identifying the human genome – that is, we know that this
exists in this location. However, if you really were studying these turtles, what kinds of
things would you be interested in? You might want to know the numbers of turtles living
on the Great Barrier Reef, and perhaps what other species they are interacting with. In
relation to our DNA, we are not so much interested in the genes themselves, but the
products they make: mRNA and proteins. In this section, we will investigate the processes
through which these molecules are made from our DNA: transcription and translation.

2B THE GENETIC CODE AND GENE EXPRESSION
53
EXPLAIN
Transcription: DNA to mRNA
Gene expression is the conversion of the genetic code within the DNA of a gene sequence
into the functional unit known as a protein (protein synthesis). Recall Figure 2A–1 in the
previous section for an overall picture of the information conversion process. Transcription
is the first step of protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, transcription occurs in the nucleus and
involves transforming DNA into pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). In everyday usage, the
term ‘transcription’ means the act of taking some information and writing it down – so, the
information is the code in the DNA, and it is ‘written down’ as an mRNA sequence. An mRNA
molecule can therefore be referred to as a transcript. Let’s look in detail at the steps involved.
1 Separating the double-helix strands of DNA
As you learned in Section 2A, DNA is a double-stranded molecule. The two strands are
held together by hydrogen bonds connecting the complementary base pairs.
Therefore, separating the DNA double helix requires the action of an enzyme called RNA
polymerase. For RNA polymerase to function correctly, it must first bind to a specific
region in the gene, known as the promoter. You will learn more about the specific structure
of a gene in Section 2D.
2 Copying the DNA code to create RNA
Once bound to the promoter, the RNA polymerase connects free RNA nucleotides to make
a strand of ‘pre-mRNA’ that is complementary to one of the separated strands of the DNA,
called the template strand. Calling it ‘pre-mRNA’ indicates that more processing is needed
before it becomes ‘mature’ mRNA.

Post-transcription modifications (RNA processing)
At this stage of the process, the molecule that has been created is pre-mRNA, not mature
messenger RNA (mRNA). For mRNA to be created, three processing steps have to be
completed (Figure 2B–3):
1 A 5΄ methyl cap is added to help protect it from being degraded by enzymes when it exits
the nucleus. It also helps it to be positioned correctly on the ribosome during translation.
2 A poly-A tail (a long string of adenine bases, possibly up to 300) is added to the 3΄ end.
(This also helps prevent it being broken down by enzymes in the cytoplasm.)
3 Splicing: the introns (non-coding regions) are removed from the pre-mRNA, so that all
that is left in the final mRNA is a continuous stretch of exons (coding regions).
A fourth processing step sometimes occurs, called exon rearrangement. This is where some
exons can also be spliced, leaving different exon combinations to be joined together. This
results in an increase in the variety of proteins that can be coded for by a single gene.

tRNA
Translation: mRNA to protein
Once RNA processing has been completed, the mature mRNA then exits the nucleus
through nuclear pores and travels to a ribosome. It is here, at the ribosome, that the
protein will be synthesised using the information (code) in the mRNA, through a process
called translation. In everyday use, a translation is the conversion of information from one
language into another. Here it is used to mean the conversion of the information in mRNA
into a sequence of amino acids making up a specific protein.

ribosomes in the cytosol or attached to
the rough endoplasmic reticulum. While
protein synthesis can occur in both
locations, the proteins formed serve
different purposes. Proteins synthesised
at free ribosomes are for use within
that cell, whereas those produced on
the rough endoplasmic reticulum will
be secreted to complete their function
outside the cell.
Messenger RNA binds to
ribosomes and transfer RNA
For the process to begin, the mRNA
binds to the ribosome. Once attached to
the ribosome, the other crucial molecule
involved in translation, the transfer
RNA or tRNA, is able to commence its
role. The structure of a tRNA molecule
can be seen in Figure 2B–4. There are
two key areas to focus on. First, it can be
seen that the tRNA binds to the mRNA
through three complementary bases.
The three bases found on the mRNA
are referred to as the codon, whereas
the complementary three bases on the
tRNA are called the anticodon.
At the other end of the tRNA, an amino
acid is attached. This amino acid is
specific to the codon on the mRNA.
When two tRNA molecules bind next
to each other on the mRNA, their
amino acids can be joined, and joining
many amino acids together forms the
initial structure of a protein, called the
primary structure or polypeptide chain.
Nearly all organisms share the same
genetic coding system, based on
the three nucleotide codons. This is
referred to as the universal triplet code.

Figure 2B–5 gives an
overview of translation.
In (1), the first tRNA
anticodon binds to the
mRNA codon (three bases
at a time). A second tRNA
attaches to the next codon
and there are now two
amino acids next to each
other. (In this example
MET is methionine, LYS
is lysine. In (2), the amino
acids are joined by a bond
(more detail of this is
in Section 2C). At this
point, there are two tRNA
molecules attached to the
mRNA. However, it is only
possible for two tRNA
molecules to be attached
to the mRNA at any one
time. In (3), the ribosome
slides along the mRNA
until the next codon is in
position to interact with the
third tRNA. Before this can
happen the first tRNA must
detach from the mRNA,
but must leave its amino
acid attached the next one
or the process of protein
synthesis would not work.
So the amino acid bond
must be made before it can
detach. (4) The process
repeats until a polypeptide
chain, part of a protein is
formed. The process stops
when the ribosome detects
a stop codon on the mRNA.
Figure 2B–5 Translation, which occurs at the ribosomes, is the process that leads to protein
synthesis. This simplified diagram shows the steps in synthesising a polypeptide chain that starts
with the amino acids methionine and lysine (code and amino acids not shown for subsequent steps).

2B THE GENETIC CODE AND GENE EXPRESSION

Codons and the amino acids they represent
As mentioned previously, each set of three bases in the mRNA sequence represents a
codon, and the sequence of the codon determines the amino acid that will be added to that
position in the polypeptide chain. The sequences of the codons and the amino acids that
they represent can be illustrated in a codon table, as shown in Figure 2 B–6. It is important
that you know how to read this table, as questions will commonly ask you to determine
the amino acid sequence based on a given mRNA sequence. The codon table is always
provided, so you do not need to memorise this.
Use the table to find the
answer to the question:

To find the code for an amino acid, look for its name in the
table. Its codes are on the left.
Figure 2B–6 A codon table, showing the sequences of bases for codons that code for each amino acid
An important aspect of the codon table is that more than one codon sequence can result in
the same amino acid. This feature is referred to as degenerate or redundant genetic code.
While this may not seem useful, it is actually important for the survival of organisms. Can
you think why this may be the case?
The answer lies in the fact that mutations (spontaneous changes in the DNA sequence) can
occur quite frequently. Considering this, imagine that every amino acid had only one triplet
sequence that coded for it. As soon as any mutation occurred in the DNA sequence, it
would result in the amino acid sequence of the protein changing.

Altering the amino acid sequence of a protein could change its overall structure, which
could have catastrophic effects on the organism. Indeed, this is the case with sickle cell
anaemia, which results from just a single base mutation. Thankfully, due to the degenerate
genetic code, this outcome is rare. In fact, some studies have suggested that more than
99% of all mutations don’t lead to any change in the amino acid sequence. As these types
of alterations have no impact, they are referred to as ‘silent mutations’. The concept of
mutations is covered in more detail in Section 9A.

Transcription and translation in prokaryotic cells
Everything we have discussed up to this point is based on what occurs in eukaryotic cells.
These processes are very similar in prokaryotic cells, although with some differences.
Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus. Instead, their nucleic acid is contained
within the cytosol and is known as the nucleoid. For this reason, both transcription and
translation occur within the cytosol. Therefore, one of the key differences of protein
synthesis in prokaryotic cells is that there is no clear differentiation between these steps. In
fact, in prokaryotic cells, the mRNA begins to be translated even while transcription is still
ongoing. An example of this is shown in Figure 2B–7. Similarly, you can see in this diagram
that (as discussed earlier in this section), transcription in eukaryotes results in two products:
initially pre-mRNA, which then undergoes processing to make the final mature mRNA. In
prokaryotic cells, RNA processing does not occur. This makes sense when you remember
that this product of transcription is immediately and simultaneously translated into protein.

Annotating diagrams
When describing processes like transcription and translation, it can be helpful to
use diagrams. However, while these drawings can be very useful, it is important that
you annotate them concisely, accurately and appropriately. There are a number of
techniques that you can use to do this. One technique is discussed here.
A useful first step is to write a one-sentence description of what happens at each stage.
This will help you to order your thoughts and think about what your diagram needs to
represent. Also, the sentences can form the basis of the annotations that you use for each
diagram. Make your notes brief and succinct.
Let’s look at how you might do this for transcription.
Question :
Use an annotated diagram to outline the process of transcription.
First write a brief statement for each step. For example:
Step 1 RNA polymerase binds to the promoter.
Step 2 RNA polymerase unwinds the double helix and joins free RNA nucleotides to
make a complementary pre-mRNA copy of the template strand.
Step 3 RNA polymerase reaches the terminator, causing transcription to stop.
Note that technically the processing of pre-mRNA into mRNA and the exiting of the
RNA out of the nucleus are not part of transcription, so should not be included.
You can then use these steps as signposts for the series of images that you want to
create, and as the text to annotate the images. Below is an example of what you might do
for Step 1.

There are two final things to note about using diagrams and annotating them
correctly. First, you do not need to draw an impressive work of art for your diagram
to communicate your answer effectively. As shown in the diagram above, you can
use a very simple illustration that includes basic shapes for the key elements of the
process that you are drawing. Second, clearly indicate the part of your drawing that the
annotation refers to. As you can see in the example, it is very easy to use an arrow to
highlight the important part at each stage. It may be a worthwhile practice exercise for
you to now complete this process using Steps 2 and 3 as a guide.

Organisms contain many biomacromolecules that are critical for their function, such

the structure of a book. A book is a series of repeating pages all bound together. We
can see a similar pattern with biomacromolecules. Indeed, a common feature of many
biomacromolecules is that they are polymers, consisting of repeating units of monomers
(Figure 2C–1). In this section, you will learn more about the monomers that make up
proteins, how they lead to the structure of a protein, and how proteins are transported
out of the cell to perform their function.

Amino acids: the monomers of proteins
The building blocks (monomers) of proteins are known as amino acids. The generalised
structure of an amino acid is illustrated in Figure 2 C–2. An amino acid has two distinct
groups: an amine (–NH 2 ) group at one end, and a carboxyl (–COOH) group at the opposite
end. A carboxyl group can also be referred to as a carboxylic acid, and so the term ‘amino
acid’ is derived from these two components: amino (–NH 2 ) and acid (–COOH).

The other important feature of an amino acid is the variable group, or R group (highlighted
in green). All the amino acids are identical in all other parts of their structure – that is, they
all have exactly the same amine group (grey), hydrogen (blue) and carboxyl group (red). The
only thing that differentiates the 20 amino acids found in the body is the variable group.
Peptide bonds
Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins. For this to occur, the amino acids
need to join to each other when the polypeptide chain is synthesised during translation. This
occurs through the formation of the peptide bond.

It can be seen in Figure 2C–3 that the reaction between two amino acids leads to the loss
of water. A reaction such is this is known as a condensation reaction. It is important to note
that condensation reactions require energy, in the form of ATP, to occur. This helps explain
why mitochondria are also important for supporting protein synthesis, as they are the
site of energy release through aerobic cellular respiration. The peptide bond, highlighted
in yellow, shows the link between the carbon atom from amino acid 1 and the nitrogen
atom from amino acid 2. When looking at a polypeptide chain, it is important to be able
to identify the peptide bond, as this will help you determine the number of amino acids
present in that protein.

To understand how unique proteins are formed, it is easiest to visualise this process using
a flow chart. Figure 2C–4 illustrates how a specific gene sequence leads to a unique amino
acid sequence that is specific for the protein encoded for within the genome. However, as
seen in the next part, the actual sequence of amino acids that comprise a protein is not the

advanced our understanding of human genetics. The genome is all the genes within an
organism; similarly, the proteome is the complete collection of proteins within an organism
at at a given time. A vast number of proteins make up the proteome and they undertake a
variety of roles in the body. These functions can be grouped into key categories:
1 hormones (e.g. insulin)
2 immunity (e.g. antibodies)
3 transport (e.g. haemoglobin)
4 structure (e.g. collagen)
5 movement (e.g. actin)

The protein secretory pathway
As you read earlier in this chapter, proteins are synthesised at ribosomes within a cell.
However, many proteins need to be able to exit the cell to perform their function. For
this to occur, the cell has developed what is known as the protein secretory pathway. This
pathway uses many of the organelles that you learned about in Unit 1 and revisited in
Section 1B. Essentially, this pathway involves the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi
apparatus and vesicles (Figure 2C–8).

Proteins are synthesised at ribosomes. You may recall that ribosomes can exist freely within
the cytoplasm, but are also found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic
reticulum plays a role in transporting proteins to the Golgi apparatus. At the Golgi
apparatus, the proteins undergo modification. The final protein products are then packaged
into secretory vesicles and transported to the plasma membrane. At this stage, the proteins
exit the cell via exocytosis, as the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane and secretes the
proteins. The proteins then complete their functions elsewhere in the organism.

lot of content. It can be very helpful to have strategies for recalling this information –
these are referred to as memory tools. One such device that can be handy is the creation
of a mnemonic. A mnemonic is a pattern of letters or associations that can help you
remember something.
The list of protein functions given earlier can be used as a mnemonic. If you look back
to the functions numbered 1–6 and take the first letter of each, you end up with

An easy way to commit this to memory is to use the phrase, ‘I almost always forget the
different functions of proteins and then it HITS ME’.
Another piece of content from this chapter that some students find difficult to
remember is which nitrogenous bases are found in DNA and RNA, and how they pair
together. A mnemonic can help you.
Step 1: Take all the words that are important to what you are trying to remember.
For example:
DNA: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine
RNA: Adenine, Uracil, Guanine, Cytosine
Step 2: Simplify this to their initials.
For example:
D, A, T, G, C
R, A, U, G, C
Step 3: Come up with a phrase using these initials.
For example:
Doing Anything Tricky Gets Confusing
Reading And Understanding Grows Confidence
In this example, notice that the phrase helps you remember that DNA contains thymine
and RNA contains uracil. Also, it ensures that the nitrogenous bases that pair together

How does it all work?
In Section 2A, you learned some general facts about nucleic acids. Have you ever
stopped to think about how much genetic material you have in your body? The Human
Genome Project found that the total length of the human genome is over 3 billion base
pairs. Contained within that huge amount of information are an estimated 20 000–
25 000 genes. Remember from Section 2C that genes are the coding information used to
synthesise proteins. Recent estimations have suggested that between 80 000 and 400 000
proteins are made within the human body. Considering the complexity of this (3 billion
base pairs, 25 000 genes and more than 80 000 proteins), how does it all work without
problems arising all the time? The answer lies in the structure of genes and how it relates
to their expression. This is covered in depth in this section.

Understanding the structure of genes
To understand the structure of genes, think about the structure of your favourite book or
movie. Any good story or film has a beginning, a middle and an end. In the middle, there
are parts of the plot that are important, and sometimes there are parts that just seem to
be ‘filling in time’. In essence, the structure of genes in prokaryotic cells is the same.
Figure 2D–1 shows the overall structure of a prokaryotic gene. We will look at those
components of a gene separately and discuss the role played by each.

Promoter: the beginning of the story
In Section 2B the underlying process of going from DNA to protein was described.
Remember that, for this to occur, the gene encoding the protein must be converted from
DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA), through a process known as transcription. As you may
recall, the process of transcription starts with a promoter. The promoter is the binding site
for RNA polymerase, the enzyme that moves along the DNA template strand, producing a
complementary pre-mRNA strand.

Introns and exons: the coding region (the middle of the story)
Introns and exons are what is transcribed from the DNA into pre-mRNA during the
process of transcription ( Figure 2 D–2). Together, introns and exons form the protein
coding region of DNA. As shown in Figure 2 D–2, there is an additional step that occurs after
DNA is transcribed into pre-mRNA, which is the processing to mature mRNA (covered in
Section 2B). However, what is important to note is that the introns do not feature in the
final mRNA product. This is because introns do not actually contain any of the sequence
related to the genetic code for the protein. Int rons are the int ervening sequences (or
int erruptions) found between exons. They have previously been referred to as ‘junk DNA’,
but it is likely that they serve other purposes that we are not yet fully aware of. Ex ons, on
the other hand, contain the parts of the genetic code that will be ex pressed as a protein.

2 A sequence from the coding region of a gene is being converted to RNA. The sequence is
TAGGATCGGATCCTTGAT. What would be the sequence of the mRNA that is made
from this?
3 The coding region is made up of two distinct parts. What are they?
Terminator: the end of the story
Up to this point, our ‘story’ (the process of turning a gene into a protein) has a beginning
(promoter) and a middle (introns and exons). It also needs an ending. The end of the
process is marked by a part of the genetic sequence called the ‘terminator’.
The terminator is the sequence at the end of a gene that signals for transcription to stop.
Without the terminator, the process would continue along the DNA strand, creating a
‘never-ending story’. As you may appreciate from the discussion of protein synthesis and
protein structure earlier in this chapter, this is critically important. Extending the sequence
even just a little, or even changing a single base within an exon, can have catastrophic
consequences for the protein that is made and the organism as a whole.

Operators: the genetic ‘off-switch’
Our genetic story now has a beginning, a middle and
an end. However, one final problem still needs to be
ON
addressed. The promoter, or ‘on-switch’ of the whole
process, could theoretically restart transcription
repeatedly. This would lead to huge numbers of
mRNA copies being produced and lots of protein being
OFF
synthesised. As you may remember from Units 1 and 2
Biology, organisms keep things tightly regulated, so that
everything is kept at appropriate levels. The process of
transcription is no different.
Once the correct levels of mRNA have been produced, transcription is stopped through the
function of another sequence within genes, known as the operator. As you can see in Figure
2 D–1, the operator is found close to the promoter. The operator itself does not function
independently; it works by interacting with another protein, known as the repressor. If
the repressor is bound to the operator, RNA polymerase is blocked from binding to the
promoter and transcription cannot commence. However, if the repressor is not bound
to the operator, transcription can occur. The repressor is an example of a regulatory
protein, which is coded for by a regulatory gene. These genes and the proteins they code
for are specifically involved in altering the expression of other genes. This is different from
proteins that have a function throughout the body, such as those discussed in Section 2C,
which are known as structural proteins (coded for by structural genes).
In the next section, the regulation of transcription is discussed, using the example of the
trp operon.

Regulation: the trp operon
To help you understand how gene expression is regulated, this section examines a specific
system to highlight these mechanisms. There are many well-defined examples, but we will
focus on just one, the trp operon , which is required for this course.
The trp operon is involved in the production of tryptophan (trp), which is an amino acid
and therefore important for the synthesis of proteins. The structure of this operon is
shown in Figure 2 D–3. See also Document 2D–1 in the Interactive Textbook for details of
attenuation and hairpin loops in the trp operon.

72 CHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS
much tryptophan is available. As a general rule, resources are limited within organisms,
and as such, organisms don’t perform processes that are unnecessary. Considering this, you
could imagine that, at times when tryptophan levels are high, the organism would not want
to be producing more. On the other hand, as tryptophan is an important amino acid, when
levels become low, it is critical that more can be produced. Let’s look at both these scenarios
and see how this regulation is maintained at the genetic level.
Scenario 1: tryptophan levels are low
For each of these situations, it is useful to start by thinking about what the aim of the
organism is in the current circumstances and how it will achieve that in the context of the
trp operon. For scenario 1, this will be as follows:
Aim: To raise the levels of tryptophan by producing more.
Solution: Increase transcription of the genes necessary to produce tryptophan (that is,
those within the trp operon).
Low tryptophan:
trp repressor (inactive)
RNA polymerase
Transcription
DNA

O
trpD trpC trpB trpA
PPS
trpE
Figure 2D–4 When tryptophan levels are low, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and initiates
transcription of the trp operon genes. This leads to the synthesis of tryptophan.
As you can see in Figure 2 D–4, this process involves RNA polymerase binding to the
promoter and many copies of the trpE to trpA genes being transcribed, which will then be
translated into the relevant proteins. These proteins will then help synthesise tryptophan.
Scenario 2: tryptophan levels are high
Once again, let’s start by looking at the aim and solution in this scenario, and then discuss
the mechanisms by which that solution is achieved.
Aim: To stop making tryptophan.
Solution: Stop transcription of the genes necessary to produce tryptophan (that is, those
within the trp operon).
As things stand from Scenario 1, the cell is currently producing mRNA copies of the genes
contained within the trp operon, which will lead to the synthesis of the proteins required to
make tryptophan. This is occurring because RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter of
the trp operon and transcribe the genes contained within it.
As you learned earlier in this section, the role of the operator within a gene is to be the ‘off-
switch’ for transcription, which is exactly what is required in this scenario. So how does the
operator work?
The purpose of the operator is to provide a binding site for the repressor. In this way, it works
in a very similar way to the promoter, which provides a binding site for RNA polymerase.
However, once the repressor has bound to the operator site, it prevents RNA polymerase
from binding to the promoter. In this way, the transcription of the operon is prevented.

While this may seem straightforward, it is important to recognise that the repressor protein is
present at all times. Considering this, how does an organism prevent transcription from being
stopped in scenario 1 and only stopped in scenario 2? The answer can be seen in Figure 2 D–5.
When tryptophan levels are high, tryptophan binds to the repressor, causing a change in shape
that allows it to bind to the operator. This prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the
promoter, which stops transcription and leads to a decrease in the synthesis of tryptophan.

2D SKILLS
Knowing your definitions
As you will have noticed, there are many terms in Units 3 & 4 Biology that you need to
be able to define. Indeed, almost all questions in this year’s assessments will require you
to know a definition. You may be asked directly (for example, the question specifically
asks you to define a term) or indirectly (for example, you aren’t prompted for a
definition in the question, but you are required to know it, to provide a complete and
accurate answer). Considering the importance of this skill, here are some strategies to
help enhance your ability to master this concept:
1 Separate your definitions. You will likely end up with a lot of notes by the end of the
year. Having your exact definitions mixed in with all your other content will make it
harder to learn them and easier to overlook them. Create flashcards or use an online
tool that allows you to have a specific place to store terms and their meanings, so you
can easily refer to them and learn them when needed.
2 Always clarify. There is no point making notes and accomplishing strategy 1, if the
definitions that you are writing down are inaccurate. Doing so would reinforce wrong
information whenever you study. If you have any definitions that you want to check
or are unsure of, refer to this textbook or ask your teacher. It is always better to be
sure than sorry! This also leads to strategy 3.
3 Ask the experts. Past VCAA examiner’s reports can be an effective way to find
appropriate and accurate definitions of terms that you need to know. These reports
often contain definitions that the assessors deem worthy of full marks. This is a great
way of making sure the definitions you are using are the right ones.
An example of this can be found in the 2018 examiner’s report, looking at Section B
Question 6a. The question asks for the functional difference between a structural gene
and a regulatory gene. This requires you to know the definition of a structural gene
as one that ‘codes for a protein that becomes part of the structure or function of an
organism’, whereas a ‘regulatory gene controls another gene’.

a What part of a gene regulates the amount of protein synthesised?
b What molecule binds to the part of the gene that is the answer to part a, in order to
stop gene expression?
c The molecule that is the answer to part b is coded for by what type of gene?
d Scientists identify a strain of E. coli that has a mutation in the DNA sequence of
the trp operon. Further analysis of these bacteria shows that they have abnormally
high levels of tryptophan. Use this information to explain where in the operon the
mutation has most likely occurred and what impact it has had.
7 Microarrays are technology that can be used to compare the expression of genes
between two different samples. They are often used to identify genes that may play a role
in disease. The colour of the spot on the microarray indicates the relative level of gene
expression between the two samples:
• Black indicates that the gene isn’t expressed in either sample.
• Yellow indicates that the gene is expressed at the same level in both samples.
• Green indicates that the gene is expressed at higher levels in sample 1 than in sample 2.
• Red indicates that the gene is expressed at lower levels in sample 1 than in sample 2.

TITLE: I can define proteome and list the six main functions of proteins with examples
CODE: 2C.4

WHAT (concept explanation):
The proteome is the complete collection of proteins within an organism at a given time. The six main functions of proteins are: hormones (e.g. insulin), immunity (e.g. antibodies), transport (e.g. haemoglobin), structure (e.g. collagen), movement (e.g. actin), and enzymes (e.g. pepsin). The mnemonic HITS ME can help remember these.

WHY (importance):
The proteome reflects which genes are being expressed at any given time and varies between cell types and conditions. Understanding the diversity of protein functions shows why gene expression matters for the whole organism.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A muscle cell and a liver cell in the same person have the same genome but different proteomes. The muscle cell expresses more actin (movement protein) while the liver cell expresses more enzymes for detoxification.

SUBTOPIC: Protein Structure and Function
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the structure of amino acids, peptide bond formation, the four levels of protein structure (primary through quaternary), the proteome, protein functions, and the protein secretory pathway.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Proteins are the functional products of gene expression. Understanding how amino acids are linked, how proteins fold into functional shapes, and how they are exported from the cell connects the molecular detail of DNA to the real-world function of organisms.

TOPIC: From DNA to Proteins
SUBJECT: Biology | YEAR LEVEL: VCE Unit 3
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: The relationship between nucleic acids and proteins, including the structure of DNA and RNA, gene expression through transcription and translation, protein structure and function, and gene regulation using the trp operon.

Introduction
Nucleic acids are one of the key building blocks of life. Since 1953, when Francis Crick, James
Watson, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin discovered the double helix structure of DNA,
we have been fascinated by DNA and how our understanding of it can help us in many aspects of
life. Indeed, think about all the ways that we now use our knowledge of DNA every day. It is a key
part of forensics, in helping identify criminals and solve crimes, or in paternity disputes. We use it
to overcome fertility problems and help couples have children. We can harness it to generate large
quantities of medical products, such as insulin. Most importantly, by coding for proteins, DNA acts
as the genetic blueprint that makes all organisms unique and allows them to function. This chapter
investigates nucleic acids and proteins, as well as the processes through which the information
contained within the genetic code is converted into proteins. It also looks at how gene expression is
regulated in cells, with a focus on a specific prokaryotic example.

ENGAGE
What are nucleic acids?
In Unit 1 Biology, you learned about factors that are essential for life. One of those
factors is the ability to store and pass on genetic material. The biomolecules that contain
all this information are known as nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are found in two forms:
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). You may have heard people
discuss nucleic acids in various ways, without realising that this was what they were
referring to. Phrases such as ‘You are a combination of your Mum and your Dad’ or
‘It’s all about genetics’ refer to the function that DNA (and nucleic acids in general)
has in our body. The concepts regarding how genetic information is passed on through
generations were discussed in more detail in Unit 2.

Understanding nucleic acids
This chapter will extend your understanding of nucleic acids as you learn about their role
in a key process within cells. In this process, shown in Figure 2A–1, organisms convert
the information contained within their genetic material (in the form of nucleic acids) into
functional molecules (in the form of proteins).

46 CHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS
Differences between DNA and RNA
DNA and RNA have many similarities. Both are made up of long strands (polymer)
of a repeating unit (monomer) made from a sugar and a phosphate group, each with a
nitrogenous base sticking out to the side. This monomer is called a nucleotide.The sugar
group of one unit joins the phosphate group of another, to form a long chain, informally
called the sugar–phosphate ‘backbone’ (Figure 2A–1).
Nucleotide
the monomer
(building block) of
nucleic acids which
are joined together
to form DNA or
RNA (polymers);
consists of
a phosphate
group, sugar and

It is important to also be able to recognise the differences between DNA and RNA. There
are three main points of distinction, which you can remember using the acronym SBS (sugar,
bases, strands):
1 Sugar: as their names indicate, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains deoxyribose
sugars, while RNA (ribonucleic acid) contains ribose sugars. As shown in Figure 2A–2,
deoxyribose has one less oxygen atom than ribose.
2 Nitrogenous bases: these are almost the same in both DNA and RNA. Both have
cytosine (C), guanine (G) and adenine (A). However, each also possesses a unique base.
In DNA, it is thymine (T). In RNA, it is uracil (U). The bases for both DNA and RNA can
be seen around the outer edges of Figure 2A–3.

Structure of DNA
DNA has probably the best known structure of any biological molecule. The double helix
is instantly recognisable as that of DNA. However, before looking at this, you first need
to understand the building blocks of DNA. Many molecules in our body, such as DNA,
carbohydrates and proteins (which will be discussed later in this chapter), are polymers.
A polymer is a molecule that is made up of many smaller, repeating units linked together.
Each of these smaller individual units is called a monomer.
Formation of the monomer
In DNA, the monomers (building blocks) are known as nucleotides. Each nucleotide
is made up of three components: a sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base.
As mentioned earlier, in DNA this nitrogenous base can be adenine (A), cytosine (C),
guanine (G) or thymine (T).
Formation of the polymer
These monomers join together to form a single strand of DNA, via phosphodiester
bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next nucleotide
(Figure 2A–4). As shown in this diagram, one end of the single strand ends with
a phosphate, and is known as the 5′ (pronounced ‘five prime’) end. The other end
finishes with a sugar, and is known as the 3′ (pronounced ‘three prime’) end.

Complementary
the term used
to describe
the fact that a
nitrogenous base
can only pair
with one other
nitrogenous
base (cytosine is
complementary
to guanine,
adenine is
complementary
to thymine)
As discussed earlier, one of the defining characteristics of DNA is that it is double-stranded.
The two strands are joined by hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogenous bases.
These nitrogenous bases cannot join randomly. Each base is only able to partner with one
other base. In DNA, the complementary base pairs are arranged as follows: adenine bonds
to thymine (A–T), and guanine bonds to cytosine (G–C). Note from Figure 2 A–5 that a
different number of hydrogen bonds holds each of the two pairs of bases together: adenine
and thymine are joined by two hydrogen bonds, whereas guanine and cytosine are joined
by three. For this reason, DNA segments that contain a higher percentage of G–C pairs are
stronger and harder to break apart.
Think about the fact that adenine always pairs with thymine, and what consequence this
has for the amount of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule. Consider whether the same
would be true for cytosine and guanine. If there are 1000 adenine and 800 cytosine bases
in a DNA molecule, how many thymine and guanine bases will there be? This feature was
known long before the structure of DNA had been worked out.

Types and structure of RNA
As you saw in Figure 2 A–1, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is the intermediate step in converting
the information coded within DNA into proteins. This process is complicated and, as such,
three types of RNA are involved, as shown in Table 2A–1. Their roles in transcription and
translation are described in detail in the next section.
Table 2A–1 The three types of RNA and their structures
Type of RNA Diagram
Messenger RNA (mRNA)
Formed through the process of transcription. This process is discussed
in more detail later in this chapter, it involves making a single-stranded
piece of RNA that is complementary to a section of DNA. mRNA is
created specifically to carry the genetic information from regions of
DNA, known as genes, to be used to synthesise proteins.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
The main component of ribosomes. As you learned in Chapter 1,
ribosomes are the organelles responsible for protein synthesis within
a cell.
Transfer RNA (tRNA)
An important molecule involved in the process of translation, which
is covered in detail later in this chapter. It has a clover-leaf shape
and is involved in delivering and linking amino acids during protein
synthesis.

Answering comparative questions
In Biology, you will often encounter questions that ask you to compare and contrast
different concepts. You might be asked to compare the different types of nucleic acids
(DNA vs RNA) or the different types of RNA (mRNA vs rRNA vs tRNA). Although
comparison questions may seem straightforward, students often don’t receive full marks
for their answer. The main reason for this is that students often interpret the question
as follows:
Question:
Compare the structures of DNA and RNA.
Interpretation:
List the differences between DNA and RNA.
A comparison question requires you to answer it in two parts. First, you have to discuss
the aspects that are similar between the two items, then you have to analyse the aspects
that are different. This is the best way to ensure that you get maximum marks for a
comparison-style question. Keep your comparisons succinct and do not repeat the
question. Let’s use the example above to look at ways to approach this type of question.
Question:
Compare the structures of DNA and RNA.
Answer – strategy 1:
Group your responses by similarities and differences.
Similarities:
• Both are made up of nucleotides containing a sugar, a phosphate and a
nitrogenous base.
Differences (make it clear that there is a comparison, by using terms such as
‘whereas’, ‘although’, ‘in contrast’ and ‘unlike’):
• DNA has thymine, whereas RNA has uracil.
• DNA is double stranded, whereas RNA is single stranded.
• DNA has deoxyribose sugar, whereas RNA has ribose.
Answer – strategy 2:
Draw a table listing key features and the responses for each item.

50 CHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS
In a similar fashion, it is important to be specific in what you are comparing and to
answer the question appropriately. In the 2019 VCAA Biology exam short-answer
section, there was a question that asked students to identify the differences between the
monomers of two provided images. Unfortunately, many students ignored the request
to identify the differences between the monomers, and just identified the differences
between the molecules themselves. As further practice, it would be a good idea to
attempt this question, using the strategies described above.

A small piece of the puzzle
When researchers completed the Human Genome Project, it was a huge step forward
in medical research. In particular, being able to know the genes within our DNA code
allowed greater insights into what was happening within our bodies. However, it actually
only provided a small piece of the puzzle.
As an example, imagine that you are doing an ecological study of the turtles that live on
the Great Barrier Reef.
Genome

all of the genes
contained with
the DNA of an
organism
Figure 2B–1 A green sea turtle swimming at the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland
Concluding that turtles are found on the Great Barrier Reef would be similar to the
information we gained from identifying the human genome – that is, we know that this
exists in this location. However, if you really were studying these turtles, what kinds of
things would you be interested in? You might want to know the numbers of turtles living
on the Great Barrier Reef, and perhaps what other species they are interacting with. In
relation to our DNA, we are not so much interested in the genes themselves, but the
products they make: mRNA and proteins. In this section, we will investigate the processes
through which these molecules are made from our DNA: transcription and translation.

2B THE GENETIC CODE AND GENE EXPRESSION
53
EXPLAIN
Transcription: DNA to mRNA
Gene expression is the conversion of the genetic code within the DNA of a gene sequence
into the functional unit known as a protein (protein synthesis). Recall Figure 2A–1 in the
previous section for an overall picture of the information conversion process. Transcription
is the first step of protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, transcription occurs in the nucleus and
involves transforming DNA into pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). In everyday usage, the
term ‘transcription’ means the act of taking some information and writing it down – so, the
information is the code in the DNA, and it is ‘written down’ as an mRNA sequence. An mRNA
molecule can therefore be referred to as a transcript. Let’s look in detail at the steps involved.
1 Separating the double-helix strands of DNA
As you learned in Section 2A, DNA is a double-stranded molecule. The two strands are
held together by hydrogen bonds connecting the complementary base pairs.
Therefore, separating the DNA double helix requires the action of an enzyme called RNA
polymerase. For RNA polymerase to function correctly, it must first bind to a specific
region in the gene, known as the promoter. You will learn more about the specific structure
of a gene in Section 2D.
2 Copying the DNA code to create RNA
Once bound to the promoter, the RNA polymerase connects free RNA nucleotides to make
a strand of ‘pre-mRNA’ that is complementary to one of the separated strands of the DNA,
called the template strand. Calling it ‘pre-mRNA’ indicates that more processing is needed
before it becomes ‘mature’ mRNA.

Post-transcription modifications (RNA processing)
At this stage of the process, the molecule that has been created is pre-mRNA, not mature
messenger RNA (mRNA). For mRNA to be created, three processing steps have to be
completed (Figure 2B–3):
1 A 5΄ methyl cap is added to help protect it from being degraded by enzymes when it exits
the nucleus. It also helps it to be positioned correctly on the ribosome during translation.
2 A poly-A tail (a long string of adenine bases, possibly up to 300) is added to the 3΄ end.
(This also helps prevent it being broken down by enzymes in the cytoplasm.)
3 Splicing: the introns (non-coding regions) are removed from the pre-mRNA, so that all
that is left in the final mRNA is a continuous stretch of exons (coding regions).
A fourth processing step sometimes occurs, called exon rearrangement. This is where some
exons can also be spliced, leaving different exon combinations to be joined together. This
results in an increase in the variety of proteins that can be coded for by a single gene.

tRNA
Translation: mRNA to protein
Once RNA processing has been completed, the mature mRNA then exits the nucleus
through nuclear pores and travels to a ribosome. It is here, at the ribosome, that the
protein will be synthesised using the information (code) in the mRNA, through a process
called translation. In everyday use, a translation is the conversion of information from one
language into another. Here it is used to mean the conversion of the information in mRNA
into a sequence of amino acids making up a specific protein.

Figure 2B–4 The structure of transfer RNA (tRNA) with a
strand of mRNA beneath it, to which it binds as shown at
the bottom. Importantly, the tRNA’s anticodon sequence
is complementary to the codon sequence on the mRNA,
to allow for binding. The amino acid attached to this
tRNA will be specific to the codon on the mRNA.
Recall from Section 1B that ribosomes
exist in two places within the cell: as free
ribosomes in the cytosol or attached to
the rough endoplasmic reticulum. While
protein synthesis can occur in both
locations, the proteins formed serve
different purposes. Proteins synthesised
at free ribosomes are for use within
that cell, whereas those produced on
the rough endoplasmic reticulum will
be secreted to complete their function
outside the cell.
Messenger RNA binds to
ribosomes and transfer RNA
For the process to begin, the mRNA
binds to the ribosome. Once attached to
the ribosome, the other crucial molecule
involved in translation, the transfer
RNA or tRNA, is able to commence its
role. The structure of a tRNA molecule
can be seen in Figure 2B–4. There are
two key areas to focus on. First, it can be
seen that the tRNA binds to the mRNA
through three complementary bases.
The three bases found on the mRNA
are referred to as the codon, whereas
the complementary three bases on the
tRNA are called the anticodon.
At the other end of the tRNA, an amino
acid is attached. This amino acid is
specific to the codon on the mRNA.
When two tRNA molecules bind next
to each other on the mRNA, their
amino acids can be joined, and joining
many amino acids together forms the
initial structure of a protein, called the
primary structure or polypeptide chain.
Nearly all organisms share the same
genetic coding system, based on
the three nucleotide codons. This is
referred to as the universal triplet code.

Figure 2B–5 gives an
overview of translation.
In (1), the first tRNA
anticodon binds to the
mRNA codon (three bases
at a time). A second tRNA
attaches to the next codon
and there are now two
amino acids next to each
other. (In this example
MET is methionine, LYS
is lysine. In (2), the amino
acids are joined by a bond
(more detail of this is
in Section 2C). At this
point, there are two tRNA
molecules attached to the
mRNA. However, it is only
possible for two tRNA
molecules to be attached
to the mRNA at any one
time. In (3), the ribosome
slides along the mRNA
until the next codon is in
position to interact with the
third tRNA. Before this can
happen the first tRNA must
detach from the mRNA,
but must leave its amino
acid attached the next one
or the process of protein
synthesis would not work.
So the amino acid bond
must be made before it can
detach. (4) The process
repeats until a polypeptide
chain, part of a protein is
formed. The process stops
when the ribosome detects
a stop codon on the mRNA.
Figure 2B–5 Translation, which occurs at the ribosomes, is the process that leads to protein
synthesis. This simplified diagram shows the steps in synthesising a polypeptide chain that starts
with the amino acids methionine and lysine (code and amino acids not shown for subsequent steps).

2B THE GENETIC CODE AND GENE EXPRESSION

Codons and the amino acids they represent
As mentioned previously, each set of three bases in the mRNA sequence represents a
codon, and the sequence of the codon determines the amino acid that will be added to that
position in the polypeptide chain. The sequences of the codons and the amino acids that
they represent can be illustrated in a codon table, as shown in Figure 2 B–6. It is important
that you know how to read this table, as questions will commonly ask you to determine
the amino acid sequence based on a given mRNA sequence. The codon table is always
provided, so you do not need to memorise this.
Use the table to find the
answer to the question:

To find the code for an amino acid, look for its name in the
table. Its codes are on the left.
Figure 2B–6 A codon table, showing the sequences of bases for codons that code for each amino acid
An important aspect of the codon table is that more than one codon sequence can result in
the same amino acid. This feature is referred to as degenerate or redundant genetic code.
While this may not seem useful, it is actually important for the survival of organisms. Can
you think why this may be the case?
The answer lies in the fact that mutations (spontaneous changes in the DNA sequence) can
occur quite frequently. Considering this, imagine that every amino acid had only one triplet
sequence that coded for it. As soon as any mutation occurred in the DNA sequence, it
would result in the amino acid sequence of the protein changing.

Altering the amino acid sequence of a protein could change its overall structure, which
could have catastrophic effects on the organism. Indeed, this is the case with sickle cell
anaemia, which results from just a single base mutation. Thankfully, due to the degenerate
genetic code, this outcome is rare. In fact, some studies have suggested that more than
99% of all mutations don’t lead to any change in the amino acid sequence. As these types
of alterations have no impact, they are referred to as ‘silent mutations’. The concept of
mutations is covered in more detail in Section 9A.

Transcription and translation in prokaryotic cells
Everything we have discussed up to this point is based on what occurs in eukaryotic cells.
These processes are very similar in prokaryotic cells, although with some differences.
Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus. Instead, their nucleic acid is contained
within the cytosol and is known as the nucleoid. For this reason, both transcription and
translation occur within the cytosol. Therefore, one of the key differences of protein
synthesis in prokaryotic cells is that there is no clear differentiation between these steps. In
fact, in prokaryotic cells, the mRNA begins to be translated even while transcription is still
ongoing. An example of this is shown in Figure 2B–7. Similarly, you can see in this diagram
that (as discussed earlier in this section), transcription in eukaryotes results in two products:
initially pre-mRNA, which then undergoes processing to make the final mature mRNA. In
prokaryotic cells, RNA processing does not occur. This makes sense when you remember
that this product of transcription is immediately and simultaneously translated into protein.

2B SKILLS
Annotating diagrams
When describing processes like transcription and translation, it can be helpful to
use diagrams. However, while these drawings can be very useful, it is important that
you annotate them concisely, accurately and appropriately. There are a number of
techniques that you can use to do this. One technique is discussed here.
A useful first step is to write a one-sentence description of what happens at each stage.
This will help you to order your thoughts and think about what your diagram needs to
represent. Also, the sentences can form the basis of the annotations that you use for each
diagram. Make your notes brief and succinct.
Let’s look at how you might do this for transcription.
Question :
Use an annotated diagram to outline the process of transcription.
First write a brief statement for each step. For example:
Step 1 RNA polymerase binds to the promoter.
Step 2 RNA polymerase unwinds the double helix and joins free RNA nucleotides to
make a complementary pre-mRNA copy of the template strand.
Step 3 RNA polymerase reaches the terminator, causing transcription to stop.
Note that technically the processing of pre-mRNA into mRNA and the exiting of the
RNA out of the nucleus are not part of transcription, so should not be included.
You can then use these steps as signposts for the series of images that you want to
create, and as the text to annotate the images. Below is an example of what you might do
for Step 1.

There are two final things to note about using diagrams and annotating them
correctly. First, you do not need to draw an impressive work of art for your diagram
to communicate your answer effectively. As shown in the diagram above, you can
use a very simple illustration that includes basic shapes for the key elements of the
process that you are drawing. Second, clearly indicate the part of your drawing that the
annotation refers to. As you can see in the example, it is very easy to use an arrow to
highlight the important part at each stage. It may be a worthwhile practice exercise for
you to now complete this process using Steps 2 and 3 as a guide.

biomacromolecules is that they are polymers, consisting of repeating units of monomers
(Figure 2C–1). In this section, you will learn more about the monomers that make up

Amino acids: the monomers of proteins
The building blocks (monomers) of proteins are known as amino acids. The generalised
structure of an amino acid is illustrated in Figure 2 C–2. An amino acid has two distinct
groups: an amine (–NH 2 ) group at one end, and a carboxyl (–COOH) group at the opposite
end. A carboxyl group can also be referred to as a carboxylic acid, and so the term ‘amino
acid’ is derived from these two components: amino (–NH 2 ) and acid (–COOH).

The other important feature of an amino acid is the variable group, or R group (highlighted
in green). All the amino acids are identical in all other parts of their structure – that is, they
all have exactly the same amine group (grey), hydrogen (blue) and carboxyl group (red). The
only thing that differentiates the 20 amino acids found in the body is the variable group.
Peptide bonds
Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins. For this to occur, the amino acids
need to join to each other when the polypeptide chain is synthesised during translation. This
occurs through the formation of the peptide bond.

It can be seen in Figure 2C–3 that the reaction between two amino acids leads to the loss
of water. A reaction such is this is known as a condensation reaction. It is important to note
that condensation reactions require energy, in the form of ATP, to occur. This helps explain
why mitochondria are also important for supporting protein synthesis, as they are the
site of energy release through aerobic cellular respiration. The peptide bond, highlighted
in yellow, shows the link between the carbon atom from amino acid 1 and the nitrogen
atom from amino acid 2. When looking at a polypeptide chain, it is important to be able
to identify the peptide bond, as this will help you determine the number of amino acids
present in that protein.

acid sequence that is specific for the protein encoded for within the genome. However, as

The proteome of an organism
At the start of Section 2B, we discussed the Human Genome Project and how it has
advanced our understanding of human genetics. The genome is all the genes within an
organism; similarly, the proteome is the complete collection of proteins within an organism
at at a given time. A vast number of proteins make up the proteome and they undertake a
variety of roles in the body. These functions can be grouped into key categories:
1 hormones (e.g. insulin)
2 immunity (e.g. antibodies)
3 transport (e.g. haemoglobin)
4 structure (e.g. collagen)
5 movement (e.g. actin)
6 enzymes (e.g. pepsin).

The protein secretory pathway
As you read earlier in this chapter, proteins are synthesised at ribosomes within a cell.
However, many proteins need to be able to exit the cell to perform their function. For
this to occur, the cell has developed what is known as the protein secretory pathway. This
pathway uses many of the organelles that you learned about in Unit 1 and revisited in
Section 1B. Essentially, this pathway involves the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi
apparatus and vesicles (Figure 2C–8).

Proteins are synthesised at ribosomes. You may recall that ribosomes can exist freely within
the cytoplasm, but are also found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic
reticulum plays a role in transporting proteins to the Golgi apparatus. At the Golgi
apparatus, the proteins undergo modification. The final protein products are then packaged
into secretory vesicles and transported to the plasma membrane. At this stage, the proteins
exit the cell via exocytosis, as the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane and secretes the
proteins. The proteins then complete their functions elsewhere in the organism.

Memory tools
As you will see throughout this year, Units 3 & 4 Biology requires you to remember a
lot of content. It can be very helpful to have strategies for recalling this information –
these are referred to as memory tools. One such device that can be handy is the creation
of a mnemonic. A mnemonic is a pattern of letters or associations that can help you
remember something.
The list of protein functions given earlier can be used as a mnemonic. If you look back
to the functions numbered 1–6 and take the first letter of each, you end up with

An easy way to commit this to memory is to use the phrase, ‘I almost always forget the
different functions of proteins and then it HITS ME’.
Another piece of content from this chapter that some students find difficult to
remember is which nitrogenous bases are found in DNA and RNA, and how they pair
together. A mnemonic can help you.
Step 1: Take all the words that are important to what you are trying to remember.
For example:
DNA: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine
RNA: Adenine, Uracil, Guanine, Cytosine
Step 2: Simplify this to their initials.
For example:
D, A, T, G, C
R, A, U, G, C
Step 3: Come up with a phrase using these initials.
For example:
Doing Anything Tricky Gets Confusing
Reading And Understanding Grows Confidence
In this example, notice that the phrase helps you remember that DNA contains thymine
and RNA contains uracil. Also, it ensures that the nitrogenous bases that pair together
are joined together in the phrases (that is, A to T/U and G to C).
If you find other information in this year’s course difficult to remember, try developing a
mnemonic to help you commit it to memory.

How does it all work?
In Section 2A, you learned some general facts about nucleic acids. Have you ever
stopped to think about how much genetic material you have in your body? The Human
Genome Project found that the total length of the human genome is over 3 billion base
pairs. Contained within that huge amount of information are an estimated 20 000–
25 000 genes. Remember from Section 2C that genes are the coding information used to
synthesise proteins. Recent estimations have suggested that between 80 000 and 400 000
proteins are made within the human body. Considering the complexity of this (3 billion
base pairs, 25 000 genes and more than 80 000 proteins), how does it all work without
problems arising all the time? The answer lies in the structure of genes and how it relates
to their expression. This is covered in depth in this section.

Understanding the structure of genes
To understand the structure of genes, think about the structure of your favourite book or
movie. Any good story or film has a beginning, a middle and an end. In the middle, there
are parts of the plot that are important, and sometimes there are parts that just seem to
be ‘filling in time’. In essence, the structure of genes in prokaryotic cells is the same.
Figure 2D–1 shows the overall structure of a prokaryotic gene. We will look at those
components of a gene separately and discuss the role played by each.

Promoter: the beginning of the story
In Section 2B the underlying process of going from DNA to protein was described.
Remember that, for this to occur, the gene encoding the protein must be converted from
DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA), through a process known as transcription. As you may
recall, the process of transcription starts with a promoter. The promoter is the binding site
for RNA polymerase, the enzyme that moves along the DNA template strand, producing a
complementary pre-mRNA strand.

Introns and exons: the coding region (the middle of the story)
Introns and exons are what is transcribed from the DNA into pre-mRNA during the
process of transcription ( Figure 2 D–2). Together, introns and exons form the protein
coding region of DNA. As shown in Figure 2 D–2, there is an additional step that occurs after
DNA is transcribed into pre-mRNA, which is the processing to mature mRNA (covered in
Section 2B). However, what is important to note is that the introns do not feature in the
final mRNA product. This is because introns do not actually contain any of the sequence
related to the genetic code for the protein. Int rons are the int ervening sequences (or
int erruptions) found between exons. They have previously been referred to as ‘junk DNA’,
but it is likely that they serve other purposes that we are not yet fully aware of. Ex ons, on
the other hand, contain the parts of the genetic code that will be ex pressed as a protein.

TAGGATCGGATCCTTGAT. What would be the sequence of the mRNA that is made

3 The coding region is made up of two distinct parts. What are they?
Terminator: the end of the story
Up to this point, our ‘story’ (the process of turning a gene into a protein) has a beginning
(promoter) and a middle (introns and exons). It also needs an ending. The end of the
process is marked by a part of the genetic sequence called the ‘terminator’.
The terminator is the sequence at the end of a gene that signals for transcription to stop.
Without the terminator, the process would continue along the DNA strand, creating a
‘never-ending story’. As you may appreciate from the discussion of protein synthesis and
protein structure earlier in this chapter, this is critically important. Extending the sequence
even just a little, or even changing a single base within an exon, can have catastrophic
consequences for the protein that is made and the organism as a whole.

Operators: the genetic ‘off-switch’
Our genetic story now has a beginning, a middle and
an end. However, one final problem still needs to be
ON
addressed. The promoter, or ‘on-switch’ of the whole
process, could theoretically restart transcription
repeatedly. This would lead to huge numbers of
mRNA copies being produced and lots of protein being
OFF
synthesised. As you may remember from Units 1 and 2
Biology, organisms keep things tightly regulated, so that
everything is kept at appropriate levels. The process of
transcription is no different.
Once the correct levels of mRNA have been produced, transcription is stopped through the
function of another sequence within genes, known as the operator. As you can see in Figure
2 D–1, the operator is found close to the promoter. The operator itself does not function
independently; it works by interacting with another protein, known as the repressor. If
the repressor is bound to the operator, RNA polymerase is blocked from binding to the
promoter and transcription cannot commence. However, if the repressor is not bound
to the operator, transcription can occur. The repressor is an example of a regulatory
protein, which is coded for by a regulatory gene. These genes and the proteins they code
for are specifically involved in altering the expression of other genes. This is different from
proteins that have a function throughout the body, such as those discussed in Section 2C,
which are known as structural proteins (coded for by structural genes).
In the next section, the regulation of transcription is discussed, using the example of the
trp operon.

Regulation: the trp operon
To help you understand how gene expression is regulated, this section examines a specific
system to highlight these mechanisms. There are many well-defined examples, but we will
focus on just one, the trp operon , which is required for this course.
The trp operon is involved in the production of tryptophan (trp), which is an amino acid
and therefore important for the synthesis of proteins. The structure of this operon is
shown in Figure 2 D–3. See also Document 2D–1 in the Interactive Textbook for details of
attenuation and hairpin loops in the trp operon.

72 CHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS
much tryptophan is available. As a general rule, resources are limited within organisms,
and as such, organisms don’t perform processes that are unnecessary. Considering this, you
could imagine that, at times when tryptophan levels are high, the organism would not want
to be producing more. On the other hand, as tryptophan is an important amino acid, when
levels become low, it is critical that more can be produced. Let’s look at both these scenarios
and see how this regulation is maintained at the genetic level.
Scenario 1: tryptophan levels are low
For each of these situations, it is useful to start by thinking about what the aim of the
organism is in the current circumstances and how it will achieve that in the context of the
trp operon. For scenario 1, this will be as follows:
Aim: To raise the levels of tryptophan by producing more.
Solution: Increase transcription of the genes necessary to produce tryptophan (that is,
those within the trp operon).
Low tryptophan:

trpE
Figure 2D–4 When tryptophan levels are low, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and initiates
transcription of the trp operon genes. This leads to the synthesis of tryptophan.
As you can see in Figure 2 D–4, this process involves RNA polymerase binding to the
promoter and many copies of the trpE to trpA genes being transcribed, which will then be
translated into the relevant proteins. These proteins will then help synthesise tryptophan.
Scenario 2: tryptophan levels are high
Once again, let’s start by looking at the aim and solution in this scenario, and then discuss
the mechanisms by which that solution is achieved.
Aim: To stop making tryptophan.
Solution: Stop transcription of the genes necessary to produce tryptophan (that is, those
within the trp operon).
As things stand from Scenario 1, the cell is currently producing mRNA copies of the genes
contained within the trp operon, which will lead to the synthesis of the proteins required to
make tryptophan. This is occurring because RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter of
the trp operon and transcribe the genes contained within it.
As you learned earlier in this section, the role of the operator within a gene is to be the ‘off-
switch’ for transcription, which is exactly what is required in this scenario. So how does the
operator work?
The purpose of the operator is to provide a binding site for the repressor. In this way, it works
in a very similar way to the promoter, which provides a binding site for RNA polymerase.
However, once the repressor has bound to the operator site, it prevents RNA polymerase
from binding to the promoter. In this way, the transcription of the operon is prevented.

While this may seem straightforward, it is important to recognise that the repressor protein is
present at all times. Considering this, how does an organism prevent transcription from being
stopped in scenario 1 and only stopped in scenario 2? The answer can be seen in Figure 2 D–5.
When tryptophan levels are high, tryptophan binds to the repressor, causing a change in shape
that allows it to bind to the operator. This prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the
promoter, which stops transcription and leads to a decrease in the synthesis of tryptophan.

2D SKILLS
Knowing your definitions
As you will have noticed, there are many terms in Units 3 & 4 Biology that you need to
be able to define. Indeed, almost all questions in this year’s assessments will require you
to know a definition. You may be asked directly (for example, the question specifically
asks you to define a term) or indirectly (for example, you aren’t prompted for a
definition in the question, but you are required to know it, to provide a complete and
accurate answer). Considering the importance of this skill, here are some strategies to
help enhance your ability to master this concept:
1 Separate your definitions. You will likely end up with a lot of notes by the end of the
year. Having your exact definitions mixed in with all your other content will make it
harder to learn them and easier to overlook them. Create flashcards or use an online
tool that allows you to have a specific place to store terms and their meanings, so you
can easily refer to them and learn them when needed.
2 Always clarify. There is no point making notes and accomplishing strategy 1, if the
definitions that you are writing down are inaccurate. Doing so would reinforce wrong
information whenever you study. If you have any definitions that you want to check
or are unsure of, refer to this textbook or ask your teacher. It is always better to be
sure than sorry! This also leads to strategy 3.
3 Ask the experts. Past VCAA examiner’s reports can be an effective way to find
appropriate and accurate definitions of terms that you need to know. These reports
often contain definitions that the assessors deem worthy of full marks. This is a great
way of making sure the definitions you are using are the right ones.
An example of this can be found in the 2018 examiner’s report, looking at Section B
Question 6a. The question asks for the functional difference between a structural gene
and a regulatory gene. This requires you to know the definition of a structural gene
as one that ‘codes for a protein that becomes part of the structure or function of an
organism’, whereas a ‘regulatory gene controls another gene’.

mutation has most likely occurred and what impact it has had.
7 Microarrays are technology that can be used to compare the expression of genes
between two different samples. They are often used to identify genes that may play a role
in disease. The colour of the spot on the microarray indicates the relative level of gene
expression between the two samples:
• Black indicates that the gene isn’t expressed in either sample.
• Yellow indicates that the gene is expressed at the same level in both samples.
• Green indicates that the gene is expressed at higher levels in sample 1 than in sample 2.
• Red indicates that the gene is expressed at lower levels in sample 1 than in sample 2.

Short-answer questions
11 The lac operon contains the genetic code for the proteins necessary to break down lactose, the
sugar found in milk. Three coding genes make up the lac operon – lacZ, lacY and lacA. For
this question, use the trp operon as a model but note that it functions and responds to lactose
in the opposite way that the trp operon does for tryptophan.
a What is an operon? (1 mark)
b Draw a representative diagram of the gene structure for the lac operon,
including all the key elements. (2 marks)
c A bacterium is in an environment with high levels of lactose (and no glucose).
Describe the process that would happen in this situation. d Explain how the process you described in part c would change over time. (4 marks)
(3 marks)
12 A central principle in biology is that information in DNA is transferred to RNA
and then to protein.
a State the monomer that makes up nucleic acids, and draw a representative
diagram of one of these structures. (3 marks)
b Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins. Draw the structure of
a generalised amino acid. (1 mark)
c Glycine is the simplest of amino acids and it only has a single hydrogen atom
as its variable group. Using this information, draw a dipeptide showing two
glycine amino acids joined together by a peptide bond. (2 marks)
d Using the codon table in Figure 2B–6, state how many codons code for glycine.
What is the term for this and why is it important? (3 marks)
e The primary structure of a polypeptide is the linear sequence of amino acids.
Draw a diagram to show this structure, as well as the three other levels of protein
structure. (2 marks)
f State the nature of the information contained in DNA, and outline how it
instructs protein synthesis. (2 marks)
13 Proteins play many vital roles within the body. When they are synthesised, some are used
within that cell and others are secreted for use elsewhere in the body.
a Define the term proteome. (1 mark)
b Brefeldin A is a drug that interferes with the function of the Golgi apparatus.
Draw a diagram showing the protein secretory pathway, clearly indicating the steps
in the process. On the diagram, indicate where Brefeldin A would interact and what
you may observe. (3 marks)
c A cellular response to Brefeldin A may be to stop transcription. Describe the
steps involved in transcription. (4 marks)

TARGET: Break down relationships, make judgments, assess validity.
TEST: Can student compare, contrast, infer, critique, or synthesise?
QUESTION TYPES: Compare/contrast, identify relationships, evaluate claims, infer from data, critique reasoning.
STEMS: "Which conclusion is supported by...", "Compare X and Y...", "The evidence suggests...", "Evaluate the claim that..."
REQUIRE: Multi-step reasoning. May include data, scenarios, or competing claims to evaluate.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
