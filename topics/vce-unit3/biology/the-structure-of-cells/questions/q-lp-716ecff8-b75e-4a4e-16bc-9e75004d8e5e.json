      "question": "Scientists have created synthetic cells in the laboratory by assembling cellular components. Some argue this disproves cell theory because these cells did not come from pre-existing cells. Which response best evaluates this claim?",
      "correct": "Cell theory remains valid because the components used were derived from pre-existing cells, and the principle describes natural cell origin",
      "correctExplanation": "The synthetic cells still relied on components from existing cells; cell theory describes natural biological processes, not artificial assembly.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Cell theory is completely disproven and should be replaced with a new theory", "explanation": "One laboratory achievement doesn't invalidate a theory that explains natural biological processes." },

      "question": "Viruses replicate by using host cell machinery but are not considered living according to cell theory. A student argues that viruses should be considered alive because they evolve over time. How should this argument be evaluated?",
      "correct": "Evolution is not sufficient evidence for life under cell theory; the lack of cellular structure is the decisive factor",
      "correctExplanation": "Cell theory specifically requires cellular composition for life, regardless of other characteristics like evolution.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The student is correct; evolution is definitive proof of life", "explanation": "Evolution can occur in non-living systems; cell theory requires cells, not just evolution." },
        { "answer": "Viruses should be classified as living only when inside a host cell", "explanation": "Cell theory doesn't allow for organisms to be living sometimes; viruses lack their own cellular structure." },

      "correct": "Controlled experiments showing that sterilised containers never develop life without external contamination",
      "correctExplanation": "Experiments by Pasteur and others demonstrated that life only appears when pre-existing organisms can access the material.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The observation that living things appear to emerge from rotting matter", "explanation": "This observation actually supported spontaneous generation before controlled experiments disproved it." },

      "question": "The endosymbiotic theory suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed by larger cells. How does this theory relate to cell theory?",
      "correct": "It supports cell theory because the engulfed prokaryotes were pre-existing cells that gave rise to organelles within new cell types",
      "correctExplanation": "Endosymbiosis is consistent with cell theory; the organelles originated from pre-existing cells, not from non-living matter.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It contradicts cell theory because it suggests organelles formed spontaneously", "explanation": "Endosymbiosis involves pre-existing cells being engulfed, not spontaneous formation." },
        { "answer": "It is unrelated to cell theory because it only describes organelles, not whole cells", "explanation": "The theory directly supports the principle that cellular structures come from pre-existing cells." },

      "question": "A researcher proposes that the first cells on Earth originated from non-living chemical processes (abiogenesis). Does this contradict the cell theory principle that all cells come from pre-existing cells?",
      "correct": "No, because cell theory describes how cells arise today, while abiogenesis addresses the unique origin of the first cells billions of years ago",
      "correctExplanation": "Cell theory explains current biological processes; abiogenesis addresses a one-time historical event under different conditions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Yes, because cell theory is an absolute law that applies to all times in history", "explanation": "Cell theory describes observable present processes; the origin of life is a separate question about unique past conditions." },
        { "answer": "Yes, because if abiogenesis occurred once, it could happen again today", "explanation": "Earth's current conditions are very different from early Earth; cell theory accurately describes modern biology." },

      "question": "Some cancer cells can divide indefinitely under laboratory conditions (immortal cell lines), while normal cells have limited division capacity. How does the existence of immortal cell lines relate to cell theory?",
      "correct": "Immortal cell lines support cell theory because each new cancer cell still arises from the division of a pre-existing cell",
      "correctExplanation": "Regardless of how many times cells divide, the principle that new cells come from pre-existing cells remains valid.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Immortal cell lines contradict cell theory because they can produce unlimited cells", "explanation": "The quantity of cell divisions doesn't affect the principle; each cell still comes from a pre-existing cell." },
        { "answer": "Immortal cell lines prove that cells can generate spontaneously once established", "explanation": "No spontaneous generation occurs; every cell in the line comes from division of the previous cell." },

      "correct": "Prions are not living organisms because they lack cellular structure, despite their ability to replicate",
      "correctExplanation": "Cell theory requires cellular composition for life; prions replicate through protein misfolding, not cell division.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Prions are a new form of life that requires updating cell theory", "explanation": "Prion replication is a chemical process, not life; cell theory doesn't need revision for this." },
        { "answer": "Prions prove that life can exist without cells under certain conditions", "explanation": "Prions are infectious agents, not living organisms; replication alone doesn't constitute life." },
        { "answer": "Prions should be classified as living because they cause disease like bacteria", "explanation": "Causing disease doesn't make something alive; many non-living substances can cause disease." }

      "correct": "The cell as the basic unit of life would still be valid, but our understanding of how new organisms arise would be fundamentally different",
      "correctExplanation": "The principles are related but distinct; cells could still be the basic unit even if they arose differently.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "All three principles would immediately be proven false and cell theory would collapse", "explanation": "The principles are interconnected but partially independent; one being false doesn't invalidate all." },
