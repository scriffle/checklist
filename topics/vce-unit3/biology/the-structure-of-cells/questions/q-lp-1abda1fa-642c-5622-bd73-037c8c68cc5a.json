      "correct": "Because both cell types need mitochondria for aerobic respiration to release energy from glucose",
      "correctExplanation": "Chloroplasts make glucose via photosynthesis, but both plant and animal cells require mitochondria to break down glucose through respiration to produce ATP.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because mitochondria and chloroplasts are the same organelle drawn differently", "explanation": "Mitochondria and chloroplasts are distinct organelles with different functions: respiration versus photosynthesis." },
