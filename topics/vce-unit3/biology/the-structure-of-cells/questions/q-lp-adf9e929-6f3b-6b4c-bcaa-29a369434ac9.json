      "question": "Some bacteria have internal membrane folds called mesosomes. Evaluate whether these represent true compartmentalisation comparable to eukaryotic organelles.",
      "correct": "Mesosomes increase surface area but do not create fully enclosed compartments like organelles",
      "correctExplanation": "Mesosomes are membrane infoldings that increase surface area for reactions but lack the complete enclosure that defines eukaryotic compartmentalisation.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Mesosomes are identical to eukaryotic organelles in function and structure", "explanation": "Mesosomes are simple infoldings, not enclosed compartments with distinct internal environments." },
        { "answer": "Mesosomes prove that prokaryotes are actually eukaryotes in disguise", "explanation": "Mesosomes do not make prokaryotes eukaryotic; true compartmentalisation requires fully enclosed organelles." },
        { "answer": "Mesosomes are now considered to be microscopy artefacts with no function", "explanation": "While some mesosomes may be artefacts, membrane infoldings do exist in some prokaryotes for metabolic purposes." }

      "correct": "Compartmentalisation enabled cells to specialise for different functions in an organism",
      "correctExplanation": "By separating processes into organelles, cells could become more complex and specialised, allowing multicellular organisms with differentiated tissues to evolve.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Compartmentalisation made cells smaller and easier to organise into tissues", "explanation": "Eukaryotic cells are actually larger; compartmentalisation increased complexity, not reduced size." },
        { "answer": "Multicellular life appeared before compartmentalisation evolved in cells", "explanation": "Compartmentalisation in eukaryotic cells preceded the evolution of complex multicellular organisms." },
        { "answer": "Compartmentalisation is unrelated to multicellularity and only affects unicellular organisms", "explanation": "Compartmentalisation is fundamental to the complexity needed for multicellular specialisation." }

      "correct": "The cancer cells would self-destruct as released enzymes digest cellular components",
      "correctExplanation": "Making lysosomal membranes permeable releases hydrolytic enzymes into the cytoplasm, causing the cancer cell to digest itself from within.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The cancer cells would become healthier due to better enzyme distribution", "explanation": "Uncontrolled release of digestive enzymes damages cells rather than improving their function." },
        { "answer": "The drug would have no effect since lysosomes are not essential for cells", "explanation": "Lysosomal membrane disruption is lethal to cells due to the release of destructive enzymes." },

      "correct": "Different cells emphasise different compartments based on their specific roles",
      "correctExplanation": "Mesophyll cells have many chloroplasts for photosynthesis, while white blood cells have many lysosomes for destroying pathogens, showing compartmentalisation serves diverse functions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both cells have identical compartmentalisation since they are both eukaryotic", "explanation": "While both are eukaryotic, the relative abundance of different organelles varies based on function." },

      "correct": "Undigested material accumulates in lysosomes, disrupting their compartment and overall cell function",
      "correctExplanation": "When lysosomes cannot digest specific substances, they swell with accumulated material, compromising their compartmental integrity and the cell's waste disposal system.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The substances simply leak out of lysosomes and are excreted by the cell", "explanation": "The lysosomal membrane retains the undigested material, causing it to accumulate and swell." },
        { "answer": "Other organelles take over the digestion function to compensate for the lysosomes", "explanation": "Other organelles cannot replace lysosomal function; the undigested material accumulates." },

      "correct": "Engulfing pre-existing efficient organisms was faster than evolving complex pathways from scratch",
      "correctExplanation": "Acquiring fully functional aerobic bacteria provided an immediate metabolic advantage without requiring the slow evolution of an entirely new metabolic pathway.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Early eukaryotes lacked the genetic capacity to create any internal membranes", "explanation": "Eukaryotes already had internal membranes; endosymbiosis was advantageous because it provided a ready-made metabolic system." },

      "correct": "Removing membranes would actually reduce efficiency by allowing incompatible reactions to interfere",
      "correctExplanation": "While diffusion would be faster, the loss of separate chemical environments would cause destructive interactions between enzymes and substrates from different pathways.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The proposal is correct; removing membranes would streamline all cell processes", "explanation": "Many cellular processes require specific conditions that would be disrupted without compartmentalisation." },
        { "answer": "The proposal would only work in plant cells but not in animal cells", "explanation": "Both plant and animal cells require compartmentalisation for efficient function." },

      "correctExplanation": "Combining functions reduces the complexity of organelle management but prevents the cell from maintaining different optimal conditions for each process.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This arrangement would always be superior to conventional compartmentalisation", "explanation": "Different processes often require different conditions; a single compartment cannot optimise for all." },
