TITLE: I can outline the cellular features of prokaryotes
CODE: 1C.2a

WHAT (concept explanation):
Prokaryotic cells have no membrane-bound organelles, contain ribosomes, have genetic material in a nucleoid region (usually circular DNA), may have plasmids, and have a plasma membrane surrounded by a cell wall.

WHY (importance):
Knowing prokaryotic features helps you identify these cells and understand how they function without the complex organelles found in eukaryotes.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A bacterium has a cell wall for protection, a plasma membrane, ribosomes for protein synthesis, circular DNA in the nucleoid, and may have flagella for movement and plasmids containing extra genes.

SUBTOPIC: Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the classification of organisms into prokaryotes and eukaryotes based on their cellular structure, particularly the presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is fundamental to biology as it explains the diversity of life and how different organisms have evolved different cellular strategies.

CHAPTER

KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE
REQUIRED FOR UNITS 3&4
Introduction
For Units 3 & 4 Biology, it is not a requirement that you have completed Units 1 and/or 2.
However, some key concepts in Units 1 & 2 are fundamental to understanding the processes
studied in the Units 3 & 4 course. Even if you have done Units 1 & 2, you can use this chapter to
revise those key concepts.
This chapter examines cells as the basic structural feature of life on Earth. Prokaryotes (such as
bacteria) and eukaryotes (such as plants and animals) are the two main cell types, and being able
to distinguish between them is an important skill. You will understand that all cells have four
common features – genetic material, plasma membrane, cytosol and ribosomes – and you will
explore the structure and function of the main types of specialised organelles.
A considerable portion of this chapter focuses closely on the structure and function of the plasma
membrane and how it contributes to the functioning of the cell by regulating the movement of
substances into and out of the cell. These substances are crucial to processes that will be explored
throughout this book, including protein synthesis, photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and immunity.

Separating internal and external
The plasma membrane (also known as the cell membrane) acts as a boundary between
the internal environment of a cell and its external environment. Figures 1A–1 and 1A–2
illustrate how the cell membrane helps to determine the two different environments.
Without a plasma membrane a cell would not exist, because the survival of the cell depends
on how substances are exchanged between the internal and external environments.

EXPLAIN
Cell theory
Before we begin discussing the importance of the plasma membrane, it is important to
know that the cell is the basic unit of life, and every cell comes from a pre-existing cell.
This is known as cell theory . The cells of plants, animals, bacteria and amoebas all have the
following four common factors ( Figure 1 A–3):
• genetic material
• cytosol
• ribosomes
• a plasma membrane.
These are summarised in Table 1 A–1.

Structure and function of the plasma membrane
The structure of the plasma membrane relates to its function and the type of cell it is in. It is
a semi-permeable membrane that allows substances to be transported between the internal
and external environments of the cell. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer, proteins,
carbohydrates and cholesterol.
The functions of the plasma membrane include but are not limited to:
• recognising other cells when forming tissue, or determining whether cells are foreign
•
during an immune response
• communicating with other cells
•
• selectively controlling which substances are transported into or out of the cell.
•
The process of transporting substances across the plasma membrane is explored in detail in
Section 1C.

The phospholipid bilayer is arranged with the hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails facing
inwards and the hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads on the outsides of the membrane,
towards the watery internal and external environments. Because the plasma membrane
is made up of phospholipids, it is able to selectively allow different substances to enter
and leave the cell. Water-soluble (hydrophilic) substances need the assistance of a protein
channel to cross the phospholipid part of the membrane. Lipid-soluble (hydrophobic)
substances are able to move across the phospholipids of the plasma membrane.

Description
Phospholipids are arranged in two
layers, with their hydrophilic (water-
attracting) glycerol and phosphate
heads facing outwards, towards
both the intra- and extra-cellular
environments. The hydrophobic (water-
repelling) fatty acid tails face inwards,
towards each other.
Proteins play a variety of roles including
transport, signalling and cell-to-cell
recognition. When they span the length
of the membrane, they are called
transmembrane proteins. When present
on only one side of the membrane, they
are called peripheral proteins.
Carbohydrates play a role in adhesion
between cells and in cell recognition.
When a carbohydrate is attached to
a protein, it is called a glycoprotein.
When a carbohydrate is attached to the
head of a phospholipid, it is called a
glycolipid.

Fluid mosaic model
A plasma membrane is made up of different types (a mosaic) of molecules. It is also fluid –
that is, the phospholipids and proteins are able to move around within each layer. Referring
to plasma membranes in this way is known as the fluid mosaic model (see Figure 1A–5 on
the previous page).
Recall that a phospholipid consists of a head and two tails, and the tails consist of fatty
acids. If these fatty acids are saturated, they have only one bond between each carbon atom,
and this makes them pack together tightly. If there are unsaturated fatty acids in the tails,
they have double bonds between some carbon atoms and this makes them pack together
less tightly. So more unsaturated fatty acids in the tails of the phospholipids increases the
fluidity of the plasma membrane (Figure 1A–6).

SKILLS:
IDENTIFYING
AND EXPLAINING
The difference between ‘identify’ and ‘explain’
The ability to identify the components of a plasma
membrane is a key skill. It is important that you
become familiar with a variety of representations of
the plasma membrane, as different diagrams can be
used during an assessment.
Figure 1A–7 is a representation of a plasma
membrane. If the question asks you to identify
some or all of the components, be succinct and
specific. If the question asks you to explain, this is
the time to elaborate on your answer.

For example:
Question: Identify components A and E from the diagram of the plasma membrane
(Figure 1A–7).
Answer: A= phospholipid, E= cholesterol
This sample response has done exactly what the question required, without elaboration.
Question: Explain how you know whether a component of a plasma membrane is a
glycoprotein or a glycolipid.
Answer: A glycoprotein consists of a carbohydrate chain attached to a protein
molecule, as indicated by C in the diagram. A glycolipid, by comparison, consists of a
carbohydrate chain attached to a phospholipid, as indicated by B in the diagram.
This answer gives an elaborated response that demonstrates the ability to differentiate
between the two components of the plasma membrane. To ensure that the answer is
clear, a comparative term is included (‘by comparison’). The answer also incorporates
specific evidence from the diagram to further demonstrate the correct understanding of
the difference between the two components of the plasma membrane.

Bacteria
Fossil records reveal that bacteria were the first type of organism on Earth, 3.5 billion
years ago. Bacteria are now the most prevalent organism on Earth – an estimated
5 million trillion trillion (that is, a 5 with 30 zeros after it). This means there are more
bacteria on Earth than stars
in the universe. At any one
time, you can find up to 1010
bacteria in your mouth and 1014
bacteria in your gut. Of all the
bacteria, 85% are considered
‘good’ bacteria and 15% ‘bad’
bacteria. Even though the
number of bacteria in your body
outnumbers the number of cells
in your body by about 10 to 1,
bacteria contribute only 1–3% of
your body mass. Bacteria are able

EXPLAIN
Benefits of compartmentalisation within cells
A cell can be thought of as a ‘reaction factory’, a place where many molecules (reactants)
interact to release new products. For a successful reaction, the molecules need to move into
and around the cell at the correct rate. They also need to be in the correct concentration for
specific chemical reactions to occur.
A eukaryotic cell is relatively large, making it more difficult for chemical reactions to occur
efficiently within it. This problem is overcome by having smaller compartments within the
cell. Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within a cell that perform specific
functions. Each organelle (with the exception of ribosomes) has a plasma membrane.
This membrane enables the organelle to maintain the concentrations of molecules at

levels that allow the reactants to interact with each other at optimal rates. The
compartmentalisation that occurs with organelles also allows various chemical
reactions to occur simultaneously in different places without interfering with each
other ( Figure 1B–3 ).
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes
Organisms can be classified into one of two groups: prokaryotes and eukaryotes
(see Figure 1B–2 ). A prokaryote is generally a single-celled organism that does not
contain membrane-bound organelles. Examples of prokaryotic organisms are
bacteria and archaea.
Eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells contain
membrane-bound organelles and are usually much larger than prokaryotic cells.
Examples of eukaryotic organisms are protists, fungi, plants and animals.

It is important to realise that cells do not all have the same types or number of organelles.
The types and numbers of organelles present in a cell are specific to the type of tissue in
which the cell is found. For example, a sperm cell requires a great deal of energy, so you
would expect to find a large number of mitochondria in it, as mitochondria provide energy
for the cell. The secretory cells that line the stomach are part of the digestive system, and
hence they require many Golgi apparatus to enable them to release enzymes that aid in the
breakdown of food molecules.

Comparison of plant and animal cells
Plant cells and animal cells have many organelles in common, but there are some
differences ( Figure 1B–6 ).
A misconception is that plant cells only perform photosynthesis and do not respire. In fact,
plant cells perform both photosynthesis and cellular respiration, and so a plant cell has both
mitochondria and chloroplasts. Not all the cells in a plant photosynthesise (for example,
root cells do not photosynthesise), but they do all have a cell wall. In contrast, animal cells
do not have any chloroplasts, and do not photosynthesise.

Two further key differences between plant cells and animal cells:
• Cell wall – plant cells have a cell wall to aid with structural support for the whole plant,
whereas animal cells do not. Animals have other features, such as exoskeletons or bones,
to provide support.
• Permanent vacuole – plant cells have a permanent large vacuole for the storage of
water, minerals and ions. The vacuole also assists with the structural support of the
cell through turgor pressure (pressure exerted by water). Animal cells do have vacuoles
but they are small and are not permanently present, and they do not provide structural
support to the cell.

QUESTIONS
Using diagrams to answer questions
When providing examples of organisms that are either eukaryotic or prokaryotic, it
is important to use cellular features as your justification. A key cellular feature is the
presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles. If the cell contains a membrane-
bound organelle, then it is a eukaryote.
One type of organism that often causes confusion is protists. A protist is unicellular but
it is not a prokaryote. It is important to remember that some unicellular organisms, such
as paramecium, contain membrane-bound organelles, as shown in Figure 1B–7 . For this
reason, paramecium is classified as a eukaryote.

You could be asked to identify which of the examples are either a prokaryote or
a eukaryote. When a question asks you to identify, there is no need to include a
justification or explanation. All you need to do is put the example into a category, or
label it as either prokaryote or eukaryote.

Answer : C
As you can see, the answer consists of just the letter associated with the correct diagram.
This is in contrast to a question that asks you to justify your choice. For example:
Question: Provide a justification for why you have identified your answer as a
prokaryote.
Answer: C lacks membrane-bound organelles. The other two diagrams show a
nucleus or another membrane-bound organelle. Hence C is a prokaryote.

One strategy to help you remember the functions of the organelles is to use the diagrams

Transportation across the plasma membrane
One of the main roles of the plasma membrane is to control the entry and exit of
substances between the internal and external environments of the cell. This is essential
for the cell’s survival. Like us, cells need nutrients so that important cellular processes
can occur. For example, they need water (for photosynthesis by plant cells), oxygen
(for aerobic cellular respiration) and amino acids (for protein synthesis). At the same
time, cells must ensure that unwanted substances or waste do not accumulate, so these
substances must be disposed of. Examples are carbon dioxide resulting from cellular
respiration, excess water from condensation reactions that occur in the synthesis of
biomacromolecules, and nitrogenous waste from proteins (such as urea). All these
substances move into and out of the cell through the plasma membrane.

EXPLAIN
The nature of substances
What makes understanding the movement of substances challenging is that they do not all
have the same characteristics. The molecules of some substances are large, some are small,
some are charged and some uncharged, some are polar, some dissolve in water (hydrophilic)
and others dissolve in lipids (lipophilic).
As you progress through this chapter, you will see that several terms can be used
interchangeably. For example, substances that dissolve readily in water (and do not dissolve
readily in lipids) can be described as hydrophilic or lipophobic. In the same way, substances
that dissolve readily in lipids (and do not dissolve readily in water) can be described as
lipophilic or hydrophobic.
NOTE
Lipophobic

Hydrophilic comes from hydro, which means water, and philic, which means loving. Lipophobic

The different characteristics of the substances being transported mean that these
substances require different ways of transport across the plasma membrane. It is the
different components of the plasma membrane that allow this to happen.
Structural elements of the plasma membrane
In Section 1A, the characteristics of the plasma membrane were described. These include
the phospholipid bilayer, proteins, carbohydrate chains and cholesterol. Movement through
the plasma membrane occurs through two of these structural elements:
• Phospholipid bilayer
•
▶ Lipophilic (hydrophobic) substances
▶
move freely through the phospholipid
Lipids
bilayer due to the hydrophobic
nature of the fatty acid tails of
phospholipids.
Amino acids
▶ Water, gases, and other small
▶

bilayer.
• Protein channels/carriers
•
▶ Polar or hydrophilic substances pass

through the channel proteins and
carrier proteins.
It is these structural elements that allow the
plasma membrane to be selective about what
moves from one side of the plasma membrane
to the other. Therefore, the plasma
membrane is referred to as being semi-
permeable, or partially permeable, selectively
permeable or differentially permeable.

The movement of substances
The modes of transport of substances across the plasma membrane include simple
diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, active transport and bulk transport.
Biologists classify these forms of transport into two broad categories: passive transport
and active transport. Passive transport does not require energy (in the form of ATP, to be
explained later); active transport does require energy. Table 1C–1 summarises the varied
nature of substances that a cell needs to move across its plasma membrane in order to
survive, the component of the plasma membrane they move through, which mode of
transport is used, and whether this mode of transport is active or passive.

Simple diffusion
The most basic way for substances to move is by simple diffusion (Figure 1C–5). Diffusion
is a type of passive transport, which means it does not require energy. It occurs naturally
in both living and non-living systems. In living systems, diffusion can take place across a
plasma membrane, as long as the molecule can pass through the hydrophobic fatty acid
tails of the phospholipid bilayer. Examples of substances that move by simple diffusion are
oxygen, water, urea, carbon dioxide, alcohol and steroid hormones.

Rate of diffusion
The conditions within a cell can affect the rate or speed at which substances diffuse across
the plasma membrane. Because diffusion is necessary for a cell to survive, the cell requires
optimal conditions so that diffusion is as efficient as possible. Table 1C–2 summarises the
main factors that can affect the rate of diffusion.
Table 1C–2 Factors that affect the rate of diffusion
Factor How diffusion is affected
Size The smaller the molecules of a substance, the higher the rate of diffusion.
Concentration The greater the difference in concentration between the two regions
(known as a concentration gradient ), the higher the rate of diffusion.
Temperature The higher the temperature, the higher the rate of diffusion. When the
temperature increases, the vibrations (kinetic energy) of the molecules
also increase and so it is easier for them to move.
Concentration

Osmosis
Osmosis is a special case of diffusion: it is the net passive movement of free water from a
region of high free water concentration to a region of low free water concentration across
a semi-permeable membrane, until equilibrium is reached. Did you notice the difference
compared to the definition of diffusion? Osmosis is all about the movement of free water.
Just like diffusion (because it is the diffusion of water), osmosis is a passive process that
requires no input of energy (ATP) to occur.
In Figure 1C–6, there are sugar molecules and water molecules on both sides of the semi-
permeable membrane, which runs down the centre. In the left image, note where the
lowest and highest concentration of sugar molecules are. However they are too big to
pass across the membrane. Also note where the lowest and highest concentration of free
water molecules are. Which way will they diffuse (by osmosis) across the membrane? Now
compare the left image with the right image. What changes have occurred?

28 CHAPTER 1 KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR UNITS 3&4
The free water has moved across the semi-permeable membrane from a region of high
free water concentration to low free water concentration until evenly distributed on both
sides: this is osmosis. Notice that the sugar molecules have not moved, despite there being
a difference in the concentration on each side (concentration gradient). This is because the
sugar molecules are too large to move through this membrane.
Note that when there is a high concentration of free water molecules in a solution, the
solution has a low concentration of solute and is called dilute. If there is a low concentration
of free water molecules in a solution, there is a comparatively higher concentration of solute
and therefore the solution is said to be concentrated. In VCE, there are two definitions
for osmosis: one refers to free water, as discussed above, and one refers to the solute
concentration. In an examination situation, both definitions are equally acceptable as long as
you don’t get them confused. So the alternative definition for osmosis is:
Osmosis is the net passive movement of free water from a region of low solute
concentration to a region of high solute concentration across a semi-permeable
membrane until equilibrium is reached.

Tonicity
Water is the medium in which many of the chemical processes of cells take place. This is
because it is an excellent solvent and can therefore transport a lot of substances (solutes), as
water moves easily through the plasma membrane. As a consequence, the water content of
the solution outside a cell (the cell’s external environment), will affect the conditions inside
the cell (the cell’s internal environment). This is called tonicity. Tonicity means that the
concentration of solutes dissolved in an extracellular solution can determine the direction
and rate of osmosis, and therefore the volume of a cell.

Tonicity in plant cells
In plant cells, diffusion and osmosis work together to cause carbon dioxide and water
(reactants for photosynthesis) to move into the cells, and oxygen and water (products
of photosynthesis) to move out of the cells, via the semi-permeable membrane. These
substances are continuously entering and exiting through the stomata.

Facilitated diffusion
A third type of passive transport is facilitated diffusion. As the name implies, this mode of
transport is diffusion with assistance from a carrier protein or channel protein. These are
the same protein transport molecules you saw earlier, embedded in the plasma membrane.
Again, keep in mind that this process is still diffusion (passive, no energy required, moving
from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration), but it involves

The term ‘protein-mediated’ means that a carrier protein or channel protein is required for
this mode of transport to occur.
• Carrier proteins are transmembrane proteins that bind to a particular substance and
•
change shape to move the substance across the membrane to the other side. This is
the case with hydrophilic substances such as glucose and amino acids (monomers
of proteins). Carrier proteins are specific to the substance they are transporting and
sometimes are referred to as being selective, in that some molecules are transported
while others are not.
• Channel proteins are transmembrane proteins that allow hydrophilic substances to
•
move through the membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low
concentration.

Active transport
Active transport is a process used to move substances that are essential for cellular
functioning, such as those involved in maintaining pH balance, regulating cell volume and
the uptake of nutrients. Like passive transport, active transport is a selective process for
moving substances across a membrane, and it occurs in living cells. However, active transport
uses energy, in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) , as the substances are moved from a
region of low substance concentration to a region of high substance concentration. This is the
reverse of the way substances naturally move and become distributed. You will look at ATP
and its role as an energy shuttle in more detail in Chapter 5.
Active transport is a protein-mediated process, just like facilitated diffusion. Every plasma
membrane contains special protein carriers, also called protein pumps, which use ATP as a
fuel for the pump. Some protein carriers transport one substance and some transport two
substances simultaneously, but all are specific for certain substances, and in this way they are
able to regulate the movement of that substance. This is why active transport is considered to
be a selective process. Figure 1C–11 shows the selective nature of the protein carrier and how,
during the transport process, the protein carrier changes shape.

Bulk transport
If the molecules of a substance are too large (or if there are too many molecules) for any
of the forms of transport discussed so far, bulk transport is required. Bulk transport is the
movement of large particles (or large volumes of liquids) through the plasma membrane,
requiring the input of energy (ATP). As the process requires ATP, it is classified as a form
of active transport.
Bulk transport operates differently from other transport processes. It is vesicle mediated
transport, which means it uses membrane-bound structures. This is why cholesterol is such
an important component of the plasma membrane – it allows the membrane to be broken
and remade as substances enter and leave the cell, avoiding the need for a substance to
cross through a particular component of the plasma membrane.
The two main types of bulk transport are endocytosis and exocytosis. The term ‘endocytosis’
comes from endo meaning ‘internal’ and cyte meaning ‘cell’. It is the process in which large
molecules (or large quantities of smaller molecules) enter the cell without crossing the
membrane. In endocytosis:
• the substance, including fluid, moves closer to the plasma membrane
•
• a portion of the plasma membrane is invaginated
•
• the membrane pinches off, forming a membrane-bound vesicle that contains the
•
substance being transported.

If the substance entering the cell is:
• solid (such as a pathogen or food), the process is called phagocytosis ( phago = eating)
• liquid or dissolved, the process is called pinocytosis ( pino = drinking). Pinocytosis occurs
in almost all cells, continuously.
Exocytosis is the reverse of endocytosis ( exo = external). It is the movement of substances
out of the cell without crossing the membrane. In exocytosis:
• the substance to be exported (often protein molecules) is enclosed in a vesicle from the
Golgi apparatus
• the vesicle moves towards and fuses with the plasma membrane
• the vesicle releases its contents into the extracellular fluid.

Figure 1C–13 Exocytosis is a type of active transport in which large substances are moved out of a
cell using vesicles.
The focus of Section 2B is protein synthesis, and Section 2C is about proteins and their
levels of structure and uses in organisms. When proteins are made by the ribosomes (as was
covered earlier in this chapter), they move to the Golgi apparatus for further modification.
If that protein is required for use outside the cell, it is packaged into a vesicle for release by
exocytosis.
As you progress to Unit 4, you will learn about the role of endocytosis in defending your
body against pathogens or disease-causing organisms. Some of your white blood cells have
the job of targeting a pathogen, engulfing it, digesting it and destroying it, thus protecting
your body from further damage. As the white blood cell is taking in a solid substance, this
process is phagocytosis.

HOW TO EXPLAIN
How to explain
Command terms are an important component of questions, as they indicate what it is
that you need to do to attain full marks. Explain is an example of a command term used
regularly in exam situations. To explain means to give a detailed account of causes,
reasons or mechanisms, or to essentially say why something happened. Consider the
following question:
Question: Identical pieces of potato (all of the same mass) were placed in each of four
beakers, which contained glucose solution or distilled water (see Figure 1C–14). They
were left for 30 minutes. Explain which piece of potato would have the largest loss in
mass after 30 minutes. (2 marks)

Distilled water
Distilled water

Figure 1C–14 Set-up of a student experiment investigating the loss of mass
from potato
Answer: Beaker A.
• Water moves by osmosis from high water concentration to low water concentration
•
along the concentration gradient across a semi-permeable membrane.
• Therefore, for there to be a loss of mass, water must be moving out of the potato, so
•
high water must be inside the cell and low water outside the cell (beaker A or B).
• Osmosis occurs faster at a higher temperature as the molecules have more
•
kinetic energy.
• Therefore, beaker A will show the greatest loss of mass in the 30 minutes.
•
Notice that this answer is set out in four dot points. This is because you have 2 marks to
score and this often equates to needing four points to gain full marks. Examiners don’t
mark you down in Biology for using dot points in your answer, so if dot points help,
use them.
An acronym you might find useful when answering questions is DER, which stands for:
• Define – include key and relevant definitions in your answer, for key content words
•
• Explain – give a detailed account of causes, reasons or mechanisms relevant to
•
the question
• Relate back to the question – relate your explanation to the information provided in
•
the question so the examiner can clearly see the link.
Here is an example of what this looks like:
Question: A student was carrying out an experiment using an artificial semi-
permeable membrane. The holes in this membrane allow water to pass through, but
not larger molecules like the sugar sucrose. The student added the same amount of
water on each side of the membrane. Then, at time = 0 minutes, they added sucrose
to one side, as shown in Figure 1C–15. Explain what results you would expect at
time = 30 minutes.

Answer: The water level will rise on the left.
• Define – Diffusion is the net passive movement of a substance from a region of
•
high concentration to a region of low concentration until equilibrium is reached.
Osmosis is the net passive movement of free water from a region of high free
water concentration to a region of low free water concentration across a semi-
permeable membrane until equilibrium is reached.
• Explain: Therefore, because sucrose has a high concentration on the left, it will
•
want to move to the right by diffusion, but it is too large to fit through the holes
in the membrane, so it cannot move. Water, on the other hand, can fit through
the holes and so it moves by osmosis from the right (high free water/low solute
concentration) to the left, where the solute concentration is high.
• Relate back to the question: Due to water moving to the left where the sucrose is and
•
cannot move, the water level on the left will have increased by time 30 minutes.

8 Once a week at the school canteen, potatoes are cut into chips several hours before they

are stored in a salt solution. The canteen manager has asked you to investigate what
concentration of salt solution would be best to use. You weighed five chips, placing
them in different concentrations of salt solution, then reweiged them an hour later. The
results are shown in the table.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can outline the cellular features of prokaryotes
CODE: 1C.2a

WHAT (concept explanation):
Prokaryotic cells have no membrane-bound organelles, contain ribosomes, have genetic material in a nucleoid region (usually circular DNA), may have plasmids, and have a plasma membrane surrounded by a cell wall.

WHY (importance):
Knowing prokaryotic features helps you identify these cells and understand how they function without the complex organelles found in eukaryotes.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A bacterium has a cell wall for protection, a plasma membrane, ribosomes for protein synthesis, circular DNA in the nucleoid, and may have flagella for movement and plasmids containing extra genes.

SUBTOPIC: Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the classification of organisms into prokaryotes and eukaryotes based on their cellular structure, particularly the presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is fundamental to biology as it explains the diversity of life and how different organisms have evolved different cellular strategies.

KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE
REQUIRED FOR UNITS 3&4
Introduction
For Units 3 & 4 Biology, it is not a requirement that you have completed Units 1 and/or 2.
However, some key concepts in Units 1 & 2 are fundamental to understanding the processes
studied in the Units 3 & 4 course. Even if you have done Units 1 & 2, you can use this chapter to
revise those key concepts.
This chapter examines cells as the basic structural feature of life on Earth. Prokaryotes (such as
bacteria) and eukaryotes (such as plants and animals) are the two main cell types, and being able
to distinguish between them is an important skill. You will understand that all cells have four
common features – genetic material, plasma membrane, cytosol and ribosomes – and you will
explore the structure and function of the main types of specialised organelles.
A considerable portion of this chapter focuses closely on the structure and function of the plasma
membrane and how it contributes to the functioning of the cell by regulating the movement of
substances into and out of the cell. These substances are crucial to processes that will be explored
throughout this book, including protein synthesis, photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and immunity.

Separating internal and external
The plasma membrane (also known as the cell membrane) acts as a boundary between
the internal environment of a cell and its external environment. Figures 1A–1 and 1A–2
illustrate how the cell membrane helps to determine the two different environments.
Without a plasma membrane a cell would not exist, because the survival of the cell depends
on how substances are exchanged between the internal and external environments.

EXPLAIN
Cell theory
Before we begin discussing the importance of the plasma membrane, it is important to
know that the cell is the basic unit of life, and every cell comes from a pre-existing cell.
This is known as cell theory . The cells of plants, animals, bacteria and amoebas all have the
following four common factors ( Figure 1 A–3):
• genetic material
• cytosol
• ribosomes
• a plasma membrane.
These are summarised in Table 1 A–1.

Structure and function of the plasma membrane
The structure of the plasma membrane relates to its function and the type of cell it is in. It is
a semi-permeable membrane that allows substances to be transported between the internal
and external environments of the cell. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer, proteins,
carbohydrates and cholesterol.
The functions of the plasma membrane include but are not limited to:
• recognising other cells when forming tissue, or determining whether cells are foreign
•
during an immune response
• communicating with other cells
•
• selectively controlling which substances are transported into or out of the cell.
•
The process of transporting substances across the plasma membrane is explored in detail in
Section 1C.

The phospholipid bilayer is arranged with the hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails facing
inwards and the hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads on the outsides of the membrane,
towards the watery internal and external environments. Because the plasma membrane
is made up of phospholipids, it is able to selectively allow different substances to enter
and leave the cell. Water-soluble (hydrophilic) substances need the assistance of a protein
channel to cross the phospholipid part of the membrane. Lipid-soluble (hydrophobic)
substances are able to move across the phospholipids of the plasma membrane.

Description
Phospholipids are arranged in two
layers, with their hydrophilic (water-
attracting) glycerol and phosphate
heads facing outwards, towards
both the intra- and extra-cellular
environments. The hydrophobic (water-
repelling) fatty acid tails face inwards,
towards each other.
Proteins play a variety of roles including
transport, signalling and cell-to-cell
recognition. When they span the length
of the membrane, they are called
transmembrane proteins. When present
on only one side of the membrane, they
are called peripheral proteins.
Carbohydrates play a role in adhesion
between cells and in cell recognition.
When a carbohydrate is attached to
a protein, it is called a glycoprotein.
When a carbohydrate is attached to the
head of a phospholipid, it is called a
glycolipid.

Fluid mosaic model
A plasma membrane is made up of different types (a mosaic) of molecules. It is also fluid –
that is, the phospholipids and proteins are able to move around within each layer. Referring
to plasma membranes in this way is known as the fluid mosaic model (see Figure 1A–5 on
the previous page).
Recall that a phospholipid consists of a head and two tails, and the tails consist of fatty
acids. If these fatty acids are saturated, they have only one bond between each carbon atom,
and this makes them pack together tightly. If there are unsaturated fatty acids in the tails,
they have double bonds between some carbon atoms and this makes them pack together
less tightly. So more unsaturated fatty acids in the tails of the phospholipids increases the
fluidity of the plasma membrane (Figure 1A–6).

SKILLS:
IDENTIFYING
AND EXPLAINING
The difference between ‘identify’ and ‘explain’
The ability to identify the components of a plasma
membrane is a key skill. It is important that you
become familiar with a variety of representations of
the plasma membrane, as different diagrams can be
used during an assessment.
Figure 1A–7 is a representation of a plasma
membrane. If the question asks you to identify
some or all of the components, be succinct and
specific. If the question asks you to explain, this is
the time to elaborate on your answer.

For example:
Question: Identify components A and E from the diagram of the plasma membrane
(Figure 1A–7).
Answer: A= phospholipid, E= cholesterol
This sample response has done exactly what the question required, without elaboration.
Question: Explain how you know whether a component of a plasma membrane is a
glycoprotein or a glycolipid.
Answer: A glycoprotein consists of a carbohydrate chain attached to a protein
molecule, as indicated by C in the diagram. A glycolipid, by comparison, consists of a
carbohydrate chain attached to a phospholipid, as indicated by B in the diagram.
This answer gives an elaborated response that demonstrates the ability to differentiate
between the two components of the plasma membrane. To ensure that the answer is
clear, a comparative term is included (‘by comparison’). The answer also incorporates
specific evidence from the diagram to further demonstrate the correct understanding of
the difference between the two components of the plasma membrane.

Bacteria
Fossil records reveal that bacteria were the first type of organism on Earth, 3.5 billion
years ago. Bacteria are now the most prevalent organism on Earth – an estimated
5 million trillion trillion (that is, a 5 with 30 zeros after it). This means there are more
bacteria on Earth than stars
in the universe. At any one
time, you can find up to 1010
bacteria in your mouth and 1014
bacteria in your gut. Of all the
bacteria, 85% are considered
‘good’ bacteria and 15% ‘bad’
bacteria. Even though the
number of bacteria in your body
outnumbers the number of cells
in your body by about 10 to 1,
bacteria contribute only 1–3% of
your body mass. Bacteria are able

EXPLAIN
Benefits of compartmentalisation within cells
A cell can be thought of as a ‘reaction factory’, a place where many molecules (reactants)
interact to release new products. For a successful reaction, the molecules need to move into
and around the cell at the correct rate. They also need to be in the correct concentration for
specific chemical reactions to occur.
A eukaryotic cell is relatively large, making it more difficult for chemical reactions to occur
efficiently within it. This problem is overcome by having smaller compartments within the
cell. Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within a cell that perform specific
functions. Each organelle (with the exception of ribosomes) has a plasma membrane.
This membrane enables the organelle to maintain the concentrations of molecules at

levels that allow the reactants to interact with each other at optimal rates. The
compartmentalisation that occurs with organelles also allows various chemical
reactions to occur simultaneously in different places without interfering with each
other ( Figure 1B–3 ).
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes
Organisms can be classified into one of two groups: prokaryotes and eukaryotes
(see Figure 1B–2 ). A prokaryote is generally a single-celled organism that does not
contain membrane-bound organelles. Examples of prokaryotic organisms are
bacteria and archaea.
Eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells contain
membrane-bound organelles and are usually much larger than prokaryotic cells.
Examples of eukaryotic organisms are protists, fungi, plants and animals.

other and react.

It is important to realise that cells do not all have the same types or number of organelles.
The types and numbers of organelles present in a cell are specific to the type of tissue in
which the cell is found. For example, a sperm cell requires a great deal of energy, so you
would expect to find a large number of mitochondria in it, as mitochondria provide energy
for the cell. The secretory cells that line the stomach are part of the digestive system, and
hence they require many Golgi apparatus to enable them to release enzymes that aid in the
breakdown of food molecules.

Comparison of plant and animal cells
Plant cells and animal cells have many organelles in common, but there are some
differences ( Figure 1B–6 ).
A misconception is that plant cells only perform photosynthesis and do not respire. In fact,
plant cells perform both photosynthesis and cellular respiration, and so a plant cell has both
mitochondria and chloroplasts. Not all the cells in a plant photosynthesise (for example,
root cells do not photosynthesise), but they do all have a cell wall. In contrast, animal cells
do not have any chloroplasts, and do not photosynthesise.

Two further key differences between plant cells and animal cells:
• Cell wall – plant cells have a cell wall to aid with structural support for the whole plant,
whereas animal cells do not. Animals have other features, such as exoskeletons or bones,
to provide support.
• Permanent vacuole – plant cells have a permanent large vacuole for the storage of
water, minerals and ions. The vacuole also assists with the structural support of the
cell through turgor pressure (pressure exerted by water). Animal cells do have vacuoles
but they are small and are not permanently present, and they do not provide structural
support to the cell.

QUESTIONS
Using diagrams to answer questions
When providing examples of organisms that are either eukaryotic or prokaryotic, it
is important to use cellular features as your justification. A key cellular feature is the
presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles. If the cell contains a membrane-
bound organelle, then it is a eukaryote.
One type of organism that often causes confusion is protists. A protist is unicellular but
it is not a prokaryote. It is important to remember that some unicellular organisms, such
as paramecium, contain membrane-bound organelles, as shown in Figure 1B–7 . For this
reason, paramecium is classified as a eukaryote.

You could be asked to identify which of the examples are either a prokaryote or
a eukaryote. When a question asks you to identify, there is no need to include a
justification or explanation. All you need to do is put the example into a category, or
label it as either prokaryote or eukaryote.
For example:

Answer : C
As you can see, the answer consists of just the letter associated with the correct diagram.
This is in contrast to a question that asks you to justify your choice. For example:
Question: Provide a justification for why you have identified your answer as a
prokaryote.
Answer: C lacks membrane-bound organelles. The other two diagrams show a
nucleus or another membrane-bound organelle. Hence C is a prokaryote.

the context of the question, re-stating that the chosen option is a prokaryote.
Creating flashcards
One strategy to help you remember the functions of the organelles is to use the diagrams
and definitions from Table 1B–1 to create flash cards. The more you use images

Transportation across the plasma membrane
One of the main roles of the plasma membrane is to control the entry and exit of
substances between the internal and external environments of the cell. This is essential
for the cell’s survival. Like us, cells need nutrients so that important cellular processes
can occur. For example, they need water (for photosynthesis by plant cells), oxygen
(for aerobic cellular respiration) and amino acids (for protein synthesis). At the same
time, cells must ensure that unwanted substances or waste do not accumulate, so these
substances must be disposed of. Examples are carbon dioxide resulting from cellular
respiration, excess water from condensation reactions that occur in the synthesis of
biomacromolecules, and nitrogenous waste from proteins (such as urea). All these
substances move into and out of the cell through the plasma membrane.

EXPLAIN
The nature of substances
What makes understanding the movement of substances challenging is that they do not all
have the same characteristics. The molecules of some substances are large, some are small,
some are charged and some uncharged, some are polar, some dissolve in water (hydrophilic)
and others dissolve in lipids (lipophilic).
As you progress through this chapter, you will see that several terms can be used
interchangeably. For example, substances that dissolve readily in water (and do not dissolve
readily in lipids) can be described as hydrophilic or lipophobic. In the same way, substances
that dissolve readily in lipids (and do not dissolve readily in water) can be described as
lipophilic or hydrophobic.
NOTE
Lipophobic

Hydrophilic comes from hydro, which means water, and philic, which means loving. Lipophobic

comes from lipo, which means lipids or fats, and philic, which means loving.

The different characteristics of the substances being transported mean that these
substances require different ways of transport across the plasma membrane. It is the
different components of the plasma membrane that allow this to happen.
Structural elements of the plasma membrane
In Section 1A, the characteristics of the plasma membrane were described. These include
the phospholipid bilayer, proteins, carbohydrate chains and cholesterol. Movement through
the plasma membrane occurs through two of these structural elements:
• Phospholipid bilayer
•
▶ Lipophilic (hydrophobic) substances
▶
move freely through the phospholipid
Lipids
bilayer due to the hydrophobic
nature of the fatty acid tails of
phospholipids.
Amino acids
▶ Water, gases, and other small
▶

bilayer.
• Protein channels/carriers
•
▶ Polar or hydrophilic substances pass
▶
through the channel proteins and
carrier proteins.
It is these structural elements that allow the
plasma membrane to be selective about what
moves from one side of the plasma membrane
to the other. Therefore, the plasma
membrane is referred to as being semi-
permeable, or partially permeable, selectively
permeable or differentially permeable.

The movement of substances
The modes of transport of substances across the plasma membrane include simple
diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, active transport and bulk transport.
Biologists classify these forms of transport into two broad categories: passive transport
and active transport. Passive transport does not require energy (in the form of ATP, to be
explained later); active transport does require energy. Table 1C–1 summarises the varied
nature of substances that a cell needs to move across its plasma membrane in order to
survive, the component of the plasma membrane they move through, which mode of
transport is used, and whether this mode of transport is active or passive.

Simple diffusion
The most basic way for substances to move is by simple diffusion (Figure 1C–5). Diffusion
is a type of passive transport, which means it does not require energy. It occurs naturally
in both living and non-living systems. In living systems, diffusion can take place across a
plasma membrane, as long as the molecule can pass through the hydrophobic fatty acid
tails of the phospholipid bilayer. Examples of substances that move by simple diffusion are
oxygen, water, urea, carbon dioxide, alcohol and steroid hormones.

Rate of diffusion
The conditions within a cell can affect the rate or speed at which substances diffuse across
the plasma membrane. Because diffusion is necessary for a cell to survive, the cell requires
optimal conditions so that diffusion is as efficient as possible. Table 1C–2 summarises the
main factors that can affect the rate of diffusion.
Table 1C–2 Factors that affect the rate of diffusion
Factor How diffusion is affected
Size The smaller the molecules of a substance, the higher the rate of diffusion.
Concentration The greater the difference in concentration between the two regions
(known as a concentration gradient ), the higher the rate of diffusion.
Temperature The higher the temperature, the higher the rate of diffusion. When the
temperature increases, the vibrations (kinetic energy) of the molecules
also increase and so it is easier for them to move.
Concentration

Osmosis
Osmosis is a special case of diffusion: it is the net passive movement of free water from a
region of high free water concentration to a region of low free water concentration across
a semi-permeable membrane, until equilibrium is reached. Did you notice the difference
compared to the definition of diffusion? Osmosis is all about the movement of free water.
Just like diffusion (because it is the diffusion of water), osmosis is a passive process that
requires no input of energy (ATP) to occur.
In Figure 1C–6, there are sugar molecules and water molecules on both sides of the semi-
permeable membrane, which runs down the centre. In the left image, note where the
lowest and highest concentration of sugar molecules are. However they are too big to
pass across the membrane. Also note where the lowest and highest concentration of free
water molecules are. Which way will they diffuse (by osmosis) across the membrane? Now
compare the left image with the right image. What changes have occurred?

28 CHAPTER 1 KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR UNITS 3&4
The free water has moved across the semi-permeable membrane from a region of high
free water concentration to low free water concentration until evenly distributed on both
sides: this is osmosis. Notice that the sugar molecules have not moved, despite there being
a difference in the concentration on each side (concentration gradient). This is because the
sugar molecules are too large to move through this membrane.
Note that when there is a high concentration of free water molecules in a solution, the
solution has a low concentration of solute and is called dilute. If there is a low concentration
of free water molecules in a solution, there is a comparatively higher concentration of solute
and therefore the solution is said to be concentrated. In VCE, there are two definitions
for osmosis: one refers to free water, as discussed above, and one refers to the solute
concentration. In an examination situation, both definitions are equally acceptable as long as
you don’t get them confused. So the alternative definition for osmosis is:
Osmosis is the net passive movement of free water from a region of low solute
concentration to a region of high solute concentration across a semi-permeable
membrane until equilibrium is reached.

Tonicity
Water is the medium in which many of the chemical processes of cells take place. This is
because it is an excellent solvent and can therefore transport a lot of substances (solutes), as
water moves easily through the plasma membrane. As a consequence, the water content of
the solution outside a cell (the cell’s external environment), will affect the conditions inside
the cell (the cell’s internal environment). This is called tonicity. Tonicity means that the
concentration of solutes dissolved in an extracellular solution can determine the direction
and rate of osmosis, and therefore the volume of a cell.

Tonicity in plant cells
In plant cells, diffusion and osmosis work together to cause carbon dioxide and water
(reactants for photosynthesis) to move into the cells, and oxygen and water (products
of photosynthesis) to move out of the cells, via the semi-permeable membrane. These
substances are continuously entering and exiting through the stomata.

Facilitated diffusion
A third type of passive transport is facilitated diffusion. As the name implies, this mode of
transport is diffusion with assistance from a carrier protein or channel protein. These are
the same protein transport molecules you saw earlier, embedded in the plasma membrane.
Again, keep in mind that this process is still diffusion (passive, no energy required, moving
from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration), but it involves

bilayer portion of the plasma membrane. These hydrophilic substances therefore
need help to get across the plasma membrane. Facilitated diffusion is also referred to
as protein-mediated transport.

hydrophilic or polar substances by diffusion across the plasma membrane with the
assistance of channel protein molecules (left) or carrier protein molecules (right).
The term ‘protein-mediated’ means that a carrier protein or channel protein is required for
this mode of transport to occur.
• Carrier proteins are transmembrane proteins that bind to a particular substance and
•
change shape to move the substance across the membrane to the other side. This is
the case with hydrophilic substances such as glucose and amino acids (monomers
of proteins). Carrier proteins are specific to the substance they are transporting and
sometimes are referred to as being selective, in that some molecules are transported
while others are not.
• Channel proteins are transmembrane proteins that allow hydrophilic substances to
•
move through the membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low
concentration.

Active transport
Active transport is a process used to move substances that are essential for cellular
functioning, such as those involved in maintaining pH balance, regulating cell volume and
the uptake of nutrients. Like passive transport, active transport is a selective process for
moving substances across a membrane, and it occurs in living cells. However, active transport
uses energy, in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) , as the substances are moved from a
region of low substance concentration to a region of high substance concentration. This is the
reverse of the way substances naturally move and become distributed. You will look at ATP
and its role as an energy shuttle in more detail in Chapter 5.
Active transport is a protein-mediated process, just like facilitated diffusion. Every plasma
membrane contains special protein carriers, also called protein pumps, which use ATP as a
fuel for the pump. Some protein carriers transport one substance and some transport two
substances simultaneously, but all are specific for certain substances, and in this way they are
able to regulate the movement of that substance. This is why active transport is considered to
be a selective process. Figure 1C–11 shows the selective nature of the protein carrier and how,
during the transport process, the protein carrier changes shape.

Bulk transport
If the molecules of a substance are too large (or if there are too many molecules) for any
of the forms of transport discussed so far, bulk transport is required. Bulk transport is the
movement of large particles (or large volumes of liquids) through the plasma membrane,
requiring the input of energy (ATP). As the process requires ATP, it is classified as a form
of active transport.
Bulk transport operates differently from other transport processes. It is vesicle mediated
transport, which means it uses membrane-bound structures. This is why cholesterol is such
an important component of the plasma membrane – it allows the membrane to be broken
and remade as substances enter and leave the cell, avoiding the need for a substance to
cross through a particular component of the plasma membrane.
The two main types of bulk transport are endocytosis and exocytosis. The term ‘endocytosis’
comes from endo meaning ‘internal’ and cyte meaning ‘cell’. It is the process in which large
molecules (or large quantities of smaller molecules) enter the cell without crossing the
membrane. In endocytosis:
• the substance, including fluid, moves closer to the plasma membrane
•
• a portion of the plasma membrane is invaginated
•
• the membrane pinches off, forming a membrane-bound vesicle that contains the
•
substance being transported.

If the substance entering the cell is:
• solid (such as a pathogen or food), the process is called phagocytosis ( phago = eating)
• liquid or dissolved, the process is called pinocytosis ( pino = drinking). Pinocytosis occurs
in almost all cells, continuously.
Exocytosis is the reverse of endocytosis ( exo = external). It is the movement of substances
out of the cell without crossing the membrane. In exocytosis:
• the substance to be exported (often protein molecules) is enclosed in a vesicle from the
Golgi apparatus
• the vesicle moves towards and fuses with the plasma membrane
• the vesicle releases its contents into the extracellular fluid.

Figure 1C–13 Exocytosis is a type of active transport in which large substances are moved out of a
cell using vesicles.
The focus of Section 2B is protein synthesis, and Section 2C is about proteins and their
levels of structure and uses in organisms. When proteins are made by the ribosomes (as was
covered earlier in this chapter), they move to the Golgi apparatus for further modification.
If that protein is required for use outside the cell, it is packaged into a vesicle for release by
exocytosis.
As you progress to Unit 4, you will learn about the role of endocytosis in defending your
body against pathogens or disease-causing organisms. Some of your white blood cells have
the job of targeting a pathogen, engulfing it, digesting it and destroying it, thus protecting
your body from further damage. As the white blood cell is taking in a solid substance, this
process is phagocytosis.

HOW TO EXPLAIN
How to explain
Command terms are an important component of questions, as they indicate what it is
that you need to do to attain full marks. Explain is an example of a command term used
regularly in exam situations. To explain means to give a detailed account of causes,
reasons or mechanisms, or to essentially say why something happened. Consider the
following question:
Question: Identical pieces of potato (all of the same mass) were placed in each of four
beakers, which contained glucose solution or distilled water (see Figure 1C–14). They
were left for 30 minutes. Explain which piece of potato would have the largest loss in
mass after 30 minutes. (2 marks)

Distilled water
Distilled water

Figure 1C–14 Set-up of a student experiment investigating the loss of mass
from potato
Answer: Beaker A.
• Water moves by osmosis from high water concentration to low water concentration
•
along the concentration gradient across a semi-permeable membrane.
• Therefore, for there to be a loss of mass, water must be moving out of the potato, so
•
high water must be inside the cell and low water outside the cell (beaker A or B).
• Osmosis occurs faster at a higher temperature as the molecules have more
•
kinetic energy.
• Therefore, beaker A will show the greatest loss of mass in the 30 minutes.
•
Notice that this answer is set out in four dot points. This is because you have 2 marks to
score and this often equates to needing four points to gain full marks. Examiners don’t
mark you down in Biology for using dot points in your answer, so if dot points help,
use them.
An acronym you might find useful when answering questions is DER, which stands for:
• Define – include key and relevant definitions in your answer, for key content words
•
• Explain – give a detailed account of causes, reasons or mechanisms relevant to
•
the question
• Relate back to the question – relate your explanation to the information provided in
•
the question so the examiner can clearly see the link.
Here is an example of what this looks like:
Question: A student was carrying out an experiment using an artificial semi-
permeable membrane. The holes in this membrane allow water to pass through, but
not larger molecules like the sugar sucrose. The student added the same amount of
water on each side of the membrane. Then, at time = 0 minutes, they added sucrose
to one side, as shown in Figure 1C–15. Explain what results you would expect at
time = 30 minutes.

Answer: The water level will rise on the left.
• Define – Diffusion is the net passive movement of a substance from a region of
•
high concentration to a region of low concentration until equilibrium is reached.
Osmosis is the net passive movement of free water from a region of high free
water concentration to a region of low free water concentration across a semi-
permeable membrane until equilibrium is reached.
• Explain: Therefore, because sucrose has a high concentration on the left, it will
•
want to move to the right by diffusion, but it is too large to fit through the holes
in the membrane, so it cannot move. Water, on the other hand, can fit through
the holes and so it moves by osmosis from the right (high free water/low solute
concentration) to the left, where the solute concentration is high.
• Relate back to the question: Due to water moving to the left where the sucrose is and
•
cannot move, the water level on the left will have increased by time 30 minutes.

8 Once a week at the school canteen, potatoes are cut into chips several hours before they

concentration of salt solution would be best to use. You weighed five chips, placing
them in different concentrations of salt solution, then reweiged them an hour later. The

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:

TITLE: I can outline the cellular features of prokaryotes
CODE: 1C.2a

WHAT (concept explanation):
Prokaryotic cells have no membrane-bound organelles, contain ribosomes, have genetic material in a nucleoid region (usually circular DNA), may have plasmids, and have a plasma membrane surrounded by a cell wall.

WHY (importance):
Knowing prokaryotic features helps you identify these cells and understand how they function without the complex organelles found in eukaryotes.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A bacterium has a cell wall for protection, a plasma membrane, ribosomes for protein synthesis, circular DNA in the nucleoid, and may have flagella for movement and plasmids containing extra genes.

SUBTOPIC: Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the classification of organisms into prokaryotes and eukaryotes based on their cellular structure, particularly the presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is fundamental to biology as it explains the diversity of life and how different organisms have evolved different cellular strategies.

KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE
REQUIRED FOR UNITS 3&4
Introduction
For Units 3 & 4 Biology, it is not a requirement that you have completed Units 1 and/or 2.
However, some key concepts in Units 1 & 2 are fundamental to understanding the processes
studied in the Units 3 & 4 course. Even if you have done Units 1 & 2, you can use this chapter to
revise those key concepts.
This chapter examines cells as the basic structural feature of life on Earth. Prokaryotes (such as
bacteria) and eukaryotes (such as plants and animals) are the two main cell types, and being able
to distinguish between them is an important skill. You will understand that all cells have four
common features – genetic material, plasma membrane, cytosol and ribosomes – and you will
explore the structure and function of the main types of specialised organelles.
A considerable portion of this chapter focuses closely on the structure and function of the plasma
membrane and how it contributes to the functioning of the cell by regulating the movement of
substances into and out of the cell. These substances are crucial to processes that will be explored
throughout this book, including protein synthesis, photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and immunity.

Separating internal and external
The plasma membrane (also known as the cell membrane) acts as a boundary between
the internal environment of a cell and its external environment. Figures 1A–1 and 1A–2
illustrate how the cell membrane helps to determine the two different environments.
Without a plasma membrane a cell would not exist, because the survival of the cell depends
on how substances are exchanged between the internal and external environments.

EXPLAIN
Cell theory
Before we begin discussing the importance of the plasma membrane, it is important to
know that the cell is the basic unit of life, and every cell comes from a pre-existing cell.
This is known as cell theory . The cells of plants, animals, bacteria and amoebas all have the
following four common factors ( Figure 1 A–3):
• genetic material
• cytosol
• ribosomes
• a plasma membrane.
These are summarised in Table 1 A–1.

Structure and function of the plasma membrane
The structure of the plasma membrane relates to its function and the type of cell it is in. It is
a semi-permeable membrane that allows substances to be transported between the internal
and external environments of the cell. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer, proteins,
carbohydrates and cholesterol.
The functions of the plasma membrane include but are not limited to:
• recognising other cells when forming tissue, or determining whether cells are foreign
•
during an immune response
• communicating with other cells
•
• selectively controlling which substances are transported into or out of the cell.
•
The process of transporting substances across the plasma membrane is explored in detail in
Section 1C.

The phospholipid bilayer is arranged with the hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails facing
inwards and the hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads on the outsides of the membrane,
towards the watery internal and external environments. Because the plasma membrane
is made up of phospholipids, it is able to selectively allow different substances to enter
and leave the cell. Water-soluble (hydrophilic) substances need the assistance of a protein
channel to cross the phospholipid part of the membrane. Lipid-soluble (hydrophobic)
substances are able to move across the phospholipids of the plasma membrane.

Description
Phospholipids are arranged in two
layers, with their hydrophilic (water-
attracting) glycerol and phosphate
heads facing outwards, towards
both the intra- and extra-cellular
environments. The hydrophobic (water-
repelling) fatty acid tails face inwards,
towards each other.
Proteins play a variety of roles including
transport, signalling and cell-to-cell
recognition. When they span the length
of the membrane, they are called
transmembrane proteins. When present
on only one side of the membrane, they
are called peripheral proteins.
Carbohydrates play a role in adhesion
between cells and in cell recognition.
When a carbohydrate is attached to
a protein, it is called a glycoprotein.
When a carbohydrate is attached to the
head of a phospholipid, it is called a
glycolipid.

Fluid mosaic model
A plasma membrane is made up of different types (a mosaic) of molecules. It is also fluid –
that is, the phospholipids and proteins are able to move around within each layer. Referring
to plasma membranes in this way is known as the fluid mosaic model (see Figure 1A–5 on
the previous page).
Recall that a phospholipid consists of a head and two tails, and the tails consist of fatty
acids. If these fatty acids are saturated, they have only one bond between each carbon atom,
and this makes them pack together tightly. If there are unsaturated fatty acids in the tails,
they have double bonds between some carbon atoms and this makes them pack together
less tightly. So more unsaturated fatty acids in the tails of the phospholipids increases the
fluidity of the plasma membrane (Figure 1A–6).

SKILLS:
IDENTIFYING
AND EXPLAINING
The difference between ‘identify’ and ‘explain’
The ability to identify the components of a plasma
membrane is a key skill. It is important that you
become familiar with a variety of representations of
the plasma membrane, as different diagrams can be
used during an assessment.
Figure 1A–7 is a representation of a plasma
membrane. If the question asks you to identify
some or all of the components, be succinct and
specific. If the question asks you to explain, this is
the time to elaborate on your answer.

For example:
Question: Identify components A and E from the diagram of the plasma membrane
(Figure 1A–7).
Answer: A= phospholipid, E= cholesterol
This sample response has done exactly what the question required, without elaboration.
Question: Explain how you know whether a component of a plasma membrane is a
glycoprotein or a glycolipid.
Answer: A glycoprotein consists of a carbohydrate chain attached to a protein
molecule, as indicated by C in the diagram. A glycolipid, by comparison, consists of a
carbohydrate chain attached to a phospholipid, as indicated by B in the diagram.
This answer gives an elaborated response that demonstrates the ability to differentiate
between the two components of the plasma membrane. To ensure that the answer is
clear, a comparative term is included (‘by comparison’). The answer also incorporates
specific evidence from the diagram to further demonstrate the correct understanding of
the difference between the two components of the plasma membrane.

Bacteria
Fossil records reveal that bacteria were the first type of organism on Earth, 3.5 billion
years ago. Bacteria are now the most prevalent organism on Earth – an estimated
5 million trillion trillion (that is, a 5 with 30 zeros after it). This means there are more
bacteria on Earth than stars
in the universe. At any one
time, you can find up to 1010
bacteria in your mouth and 1014
bacteria in your gut. Of all the
bacteria, 85% are considered
‘good’ bacteria and 15% ‘bad’
bacteria. Even though the
number of bacteria in your body
outnumbers the number of cells
in your body by about 10 to 1,
bacteria contribute only 1–3% of
your body mass. Bacteria are able

EXPLAIN
Benefits of compartmentalisation within cells
A cell can be thought of as a ‘reaction factory’, a place where many molecules (reactants)
interact to release new products. For a successful reaction, the molecules need to move into
and around the cell at the correct rate. They also need to be in the correct concentration for
specific chemical reactions to occur.
A eukaryotic cell is relatively large, making it more difficult for chemical reactions to occur
efficiently within it. This problem is overcome by having smaller compartments within the
cell. Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within a cell that perform specific
functions. Each organelle (with the exception of ribosomes) has a plasma membrane.
This membrane enables the organelle to maintain the concentrations of molecules at

levels that allow the reactants to interact with each other at optimal rates. The
compartmentalisation that occurs with organelles also allows various chemical
reactions to occur simultaneously in different places without interfering with each
other ( Figure 1B–3 ).
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes
Organisms can be classified into one of two groups: prokaryotes and eukaryotes
(see Figure 1B–2 ). A prokaryote is generally a single-celled organism that does not
contain membrane-bound organelles. Examples of prokaryotic organisms are
bacteria and archaea.
Eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells contain
membrane-bound organelles and are usually much larger than prokaryotic cells.
Examples of eukaryotic organisms are protists, fungi, plants and animals.

If the reactant molecules are

by being enclosed in an
organelle, they are more
likely to bump into each
other and react.

Figure 1B–2 Organisms can be classified as prokaryotes or eukaryotes. This diagram also

It is important to realise that cells do not all have the same types or number of organelles.
The types and numbers of organelles present in a cell are specific to the type of tissue in
which the cell is found. For example, a sperm cell requires a great deal of energy, so you
would expect to find a large number of mitochondria in it, as mitochondria provide energy
for the cell. The secretory cells that line the stomach are part of the digestive system, and
hence they require many Golgi apparatus to enable them to release enzymes that aid in the
breakdown of food molecules.

Comparison of plant and animal cells
Plant cells and animal cells have many organelles in common, but there are some
differences ( Figure 1B–6 ).
A misconception is that plant cells only perform photosynthesis and do not respire. In fact,
plant cells perform both photosynthesis and cellular respiration, and so a plant cell has both
mitochondria and chloroplasts. Not all the cells in a plant photosynthesise (for example,
root cells do not photosynthesise), but they do all have a cell wall. In contrast, animal cells
do not have any chloroplasts, and do not photosynthesise.

Two further key differences between plant cells and animal cells:
• Cell wall – plant cells have a cell wall to aid with structural support for the whole plant,
whereas animal cells do not. Animals have other features, such as exoskeletons or bones,
to provide support.
• Permanent vacuole – plant cells have a permanent large vacuole for the storage of
water, minerals and ions. The vacuole also assists with the structural support of the
cell through turgor pressure (pressure exerted by water). Animal cells do have vacuoles
but they are small and are not permanently present, and they do not provide structural
support to the cell.

QUESTIONS
Using diagrams to answer questions
When providing examples of organisms that are either eukaryotic or prokaryotic, it
is important to use cellular features as your justification. A key cellular feature is the
presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles. If the cell contains a membrane-
bound organelle, then it is a eukaryote.
One type of organism that often causes confusion is protists. A protist is unicellular but
it is not a prokaryote. It is important to remember that some unicellular organisms, such
as paramecium, contain membrane-bound organelles, as shown in Figure 1B–7 . For this
reason, paramecium is classified as a eukaryote.

You could be asked to identify which of the examples are either a prokaryote or
a eukaryote. When a question asks you to identify, there is no need to include a
justification or explanation. All you need to do is put the example into a category, or
label it as either prokaryote or eukaryote.
For example:
Question: Identify which of the diagrams shows a prokaryote.

Answer : C
As you can see, the answer consists of just the letter associated with the correct diagram.
This is in contrast to a question that asks you to justify your choice. For example:
Question: Provide a justification for why you have identified your answer as a
prokaryote.
Answer: C lacks membrane-bound organelles. The other two diagrams show a
nucleus or another membrane-bound organelle. Hence C is a prokaryote.

Note that the answer does not repeat the question, and it gives a specific piece of
evidence as the reason for the choice. The response also finishes off by coming back to
the context of the question, re-stating that the chosen option is a prokaryote.
Creating flashcards
One strategy to help you remember the functions of the organelles is to use the diagrams
and definitions from Table 1B–1 to create flash cards. The more you use images

Transportation across the plasma membrane
One of the main roles of the plasma membrane is to control the entry and exit of
substances between the internal and external environments of the cell. This is essential
for the cell’s survival. Like us, cells need nutrients so that important cellular processes
can occur. For example, they need water (for photosynthesis by plant cells), oxygen
(for aerobic cellular respiration) and amino acids (for protein synthesis). At the same
time, cells must ensure that unwanted substances or waste do not accumulate, so these
substances must be disposed of. Examples are carbon dioxide resulting from cellular
respiration, excess water from condensation reactions that occur in the synthesis of
biomacromolecules, and nitrogenous waste from proteins (such as urea). All these
substances move into and out of the cell through the plasma membrane.

EXPLAIN
The nature of substances
What makes understanding the movement of substances challenging is that they do not all
have the same characteristics. The molecules of some substances are large, some are small,
some are charged and some uncharged, some are polar, some dissolve in water (hydrophilic)
and others dissolve in lipids (lipophilic).
As you progress through this chapter, you will see that several terms can be used
interchangeably. For example, substances that dissolve readily in water (and do not dissolve
readily in lipids) can be described as hydrophilic or lipophobic. In the same way, substances
that dissolve readily in lipids (and do not dissolve readily in water) can be described as
lipophilic or hydrophobic.
NOTE
Lipophobic

Hydrophilic comes from hydro, which means water, and philic, which means loving. Lipophobic

The different characteristics of the substances being transported mean that these
substances require different ways of transport across the plasma membrane. It is the
different components of the plasma membrane that allow this to happen.
Structural elements of the plasma membrane
In Section 1A, the characteristics of the plasma membrane were described. These include
the phospholipid bilayer, proteins, carbohydrate chains and cholesterol. Movement through
the plasma membrane occurs through two of these structural elements:
• Phospholipid bilayer
•
▶ Lipophilic (hydrophobic) substances
▶
move freely through the phospholipid
Lipids
bilayer due to the hydrophobic
nature of the fatty acid tails of
phospholipids.
Amino acids
▶ Water, gases, and other small
▶
hydrophobic molecules can diffuse

Water
bilayer.
• Protein channels/carriers
•
▶ Polar or hydrophilic substances pass
▶
through the channel proteins and
carrier proteins.
It is these structural elements that allow the
plasma membrane to be selective about what
moves from one side of the plasma membrane
to the other. Therefore, the plasma
membrane is referred to as being semi-
permeable, or partially permeable, selectively
permeable or differentially permeable.

The movement of substances
The modes of transport of substances across the plasma membrane include simple
diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, active transport and bulk transport.
Biologists classify these forms of transport into two broad categories: passive transport
and active transport. Passive transport does not require energy (in the form of ATP, to be
explained later); active transport does require energy. Table 1C–1 summarises the varied
nature of substances that a cell needs to move across its plasma membrane in order to
survive, the component of the plasma membrane they move through, which mode of
transport is used, and whether this mode of transport is active or passive.

Simple diffusion
The most basic way for substances to move is by simple diffusion (Figure 1C–5). Diffusion
is a type of passive transport, which means it does not require energy. It occurs naturally
in both living and non-living systems. In living systems, diffusion can take place across a
plasma membrane, as long as the molecule can pass through the hydrophobic fatty acid
tails of the phospholipid bilayer. Examples of substances that move by simple diffusion are
oxygen, water, urea, carbon dioxide, alcohol and steroid hormones.

Rate of diffusion
The conditions within a cell can affect the rate or speed at which substances diffuse across
the plasma membrane. Because diffusion is necessary for a cell to survive, the cell requires
optimal conditions so that diffusion is as efficient as possible. Table 1C–2 summarises the
main factors that can affect the rate of diffusion.
Table 1C–2 Factors that affect the rate of diffusion
Factor How diffusion is affected
Size The smaller the molecules of a substance, the higher the rate of diffusion.
Concentration The greater the difference in concentration between the two regions
(known as a concentration gradient ), the higher the rate of diffusion.
Temperature The higher the temperature, the higher the rate of diffusion. When the
temperature increases, the vibrations (kinetic energy) of the molecules
also increase and so it is easier for them to move.
Concentration
gradient

between the
concentrations
of a substance
in two regions; if
there is a large
difference, the

Osmosis
Osmosis is a special case of diffusion: it is the net passive movement of free water from a
region of high free water concentration to a region of low free water concentration across
a semi-permeable membrane, until equilibrium is reached. Did you notice the difference
compared to the definition of diffusion? Osmosis is all about the movement of free water.
Just like diffusion (because it is the diffusion of water), osmosis is a passive process that
requires no input of energy (ATP) to occur.
In Figure 1C–6, there are sugar molecules and water molecules on both sides of the semi-
permeable membrane, which runs down the centre. In the left image, note where the
lowest and highest concentration of sugar molecules are. However they are too big to
pass across the membrane. Also note where the lowest and highest concentration of free
water molecules are. Which way will they diffuse (by osmosis) across the membrane? Now
compare the left image with the right image. What changes have occurred?

28 CHAPTER 1 KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR UNITS 3&4
The free water has moved across the semi-permeable membrane from a region of high
free water concentration to low free water concentration until evenly distributed on both
sides: this is osmosis. Notice that the sugar molecules have not moved, despite there being
a difference in the concentration on each side (concentration gradient). This is because the
sugar molecules are too large to move through this membrane.
Note that when there is a high concentration of free water molecules in a solution, the
solution has a low concentration of solute and is called dilute. If there is a low concentration
of free water molecules in a solution, there is a comparatively higher concentration of solute
and therefore the solution is said to be concentrated. In VCE, there are two definitions
for osmosis: one refers to free water, as discussed above, and one refers to the solute
concentration. In an examination situation, both definitions are equally acceptable as long as
you don’t get them confused. So the alternative definition for osmosis is:
Osmosis is the net passive movement of free water from a region of low solute
concentration to a region of high solute concentration across a semi-permeable
membrane until equilibrium is reached.

Tonicity
Water is the medium in which many of the chemical processes of cells take place. This is
because it is an excellent solvent and can therefore transport a lot of substances (solutes), as
water moves easily through the plasma membrane. As a consequence, the water content of
the solution outside a cell (the cell’s external environment), will affect the conditions inside
the cell (the cell’s internal environment). This is called tonicity. Tonicity means that the

Tonicity in plant cells
In plant cells, diffusion and osmosis work together to cause carbon dioxide and water
(reactants for photosynthesis) to move into the cells, and oxygen and water (products
of photosynthesis) to move out of the cells, via the semi-permeable membrane. These
substances are continuously entering and exiting through the stomata.

Facilitated diffusion
A third type of passive transport is facilitated diffusion. As the name implies, this mode of
transport is diffusion with assistance from a carrier protein or channel protein. These are
the same protein transport molecules you saw earlier, embedded in the plasma membrane.
Again, keep in mind that this process is still diffusion (passive, no energy required, moving
from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration), but it involves

moving hydrophilic or polar substances that cannot diffuse through the phospholipid
bilayer portion of the plasma membrane. These hydrophilic substances therefore
need help to get across the plasma membrane. Facilitated diffusion is also referred to
as protein-mediated transport.

The term ‘protein-mediated’ means that a carrier protein or channel protein is required for
this mode of transport to occur.
• Carrier proteins are transmembrane proteins that bind to a particular substance and
•
change shape to move the substance across the membrane to the other side. This is
the case with hydrophilic substances such as glucose and amino acids (monomers
of proteins). Carrier proteins are specific to the substance they are transporting and
sometimes are referred to as being selective, in that some molecules are transported
while others are not.
• Channel proteins are transmembrane proteins that allow hydrophilic substances to
•
move through the membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low
concentration.

Active transport
Active transport is a process used to move substances that are essential for cellular
functioning, such as those involved in maintaining pH balance, regulating cell volume and
the uptake of nutrients. Like passive transport, active transport is a selective process for
moving substances across a membrane, and it occurs in living cells. However, active transport
uses energy, in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) , as the substances are moved from a
region of low substance concentration to a region of high substance concentration. This is the
reverse of the way substances naturally move and become distributed. You will look at ATP
and its role as an energy shuttle in more detail in Chapter 5.
Active transport is a protein-mediated process, just like facilitated diffusion. Every plasma
membrane contains special protein carriers, also called protein pumps, which use ATP as a
fuel for the pump. Some protein carriers transport one substance and some transport two
substances simultaneously, but all are specific for certain substances, and in this way they are
able to regulate the movement of that substance. This is why active transport is considered to
be a selective process. Figure 1C–11 shows the selective nature of the protein carrier and how,
during the transport process, the protein carrier changes shape.

Bulk transport
If the molecules of a substance are too large (or if there are too many molecules) for any
of the forms of transport discussed so far, bulk transport is required. Bulk transport is the
movement of large particles (or large volumes of liquids) through the plasma membrane,
requiring the input of energy (ATP). As the process requires ATP, it is classified as a form
of active transport.
Bulk transport operates differently from other transport processes. It is vesicle mediated
transport, which means it uses membrane-bound structures. This is why cholesterol is such
an important component of the plasma membrane – it allows the membrane to be broken
and remade as substances enter and leave the cell, avoiding the need for a substance to
cross through a particular component of the plasma membrane.
The two main types of bulk transport are endocytosis and exocytosis. The term ‘endocytosis’
comes from endo meaning ‘internal’ and cyte meaning ‘cell’. It is the process in which large
molecules (or large quantities of smaller molecules) enter the cell without crossing the
membrane. In endocytosis:
• the substance, including fluid, moves closer to the plasma membrane
•
• a portion of the plasma membrane is invaginated
•
• the membrane pinches off, forming a membrane-bound vesicle that contains the
•
substance being transported.

If the substance entering the cell is:
• solid (such as a pathogen or food), the process is called phagocytosis ( phago = eating)
• liquid or dissolved, the process is called pinocytosis ( pino = drinking). Pinocytosis occurs
in almost all cells, continuously.
Exocytosis is the reverse of endocytosis ( exo = external). It is the movement of substances
out of the cell without crossing the membrane. In exocytosis:
• the substance to be exported (often protein molecules) is enclosed in a vesicle from the
Golgi apparatus
• the vesicle moves towards and fuses with the plasma membrane
• the vesicle releases its contents into the extracellular fluid.

Figure 1C–13 Exocytosis is a type of active transport in which large substances are moved out of a

The focus of Section 2B is protein synthesis, and Section 2C is about proteins and their
levels of structure and uses in organisms. When proteins are made by the ribosomes (as was
covered earlier in this chapter), they move to the Golgi apparatus for further modification.
If that protein is required for use outside the cell, it is packaged into a vesicle for release by
exocytosis.
As you progress to Unit 4, you will learn about the role of endocytosis in defending your
body against pathogens or disease-causing organisms. Some of your white blood cells have
the job of targeting a pathogen, engulfing it, digesting it and destroying it, thus protecting
your body from further damage. As the white blood cell is taking in a solid substance, this
process is phagocytosis.

How to explain
Command terms are an important component of questions, as they indicate what it is
that you need to do to attain full marks. Explain is an example of a command term used
regularly in exam situations. To explain means to give a detailed account of causes,
reasons or mechanisms, or to essentially say why something happened. Consider the
following question:
Question: Identical pieces of potato (all of the same mass) were placed in each of four
beakers, which contained glucose solution or distilled water (see Figure 1C–14). They
were left for 30 minutes. Explain which piece of potato would have the largest loss in
mass after 30 minutes. (2 marks)

Figure 1C–14 Set-up of a student experiment investigating the loss of mass
from potato
Answer: Beaker A.
• Water moves by osmosis from high water concentration to low water concentration
•
along the concentration gradient across a semi-permeable membrane.
• Therefore, for there to be a loss of mass, water must be moving out of the potato, so
•
high water must be inside the cell and low water outside the cell (beaker A or B).
• Osmosis occurs faster at a higher temperature as the molecules have more
•
kinetic energy.
• Therefore, beaker A will show the greatest loss of mass in the 30 minutes.
•
Notice that this answer is set out in four dot points. This is because you have 2 marks to
score and this often equates to needing four points to gain full marks. Examiners don’t
mark you down in Biology for using dot points in your answer, so if dot points help,
use them.
An acronym you might find useful when answering questions is DER, which stands for:
• Define – include key and relevant definitions in your answer, for key content words
•
• Explain – give a detailed account of causes, reasons or mechanisms relevant to
•
the question
• Relate back to the question – relate your explanation to the information provided in
•
the question so the examiner can clearly see the link.
Here is an example of what this looks like:
Question: A student was carrying out an experiment using an artificial semi-
permeable membrane. The holes in this membrane allow water to pass through, but
not larger molecules like the sugar sucrose. The student added the same amount of
water on each side of the membrane. Then, at time = 0 minutes, they added sucrose
to one side, as shown in Figure 1C–15. Explain what results you would expect at
time = 30 minutes.

Answer: The water level will rise on the left.
• Define – Diffusion is the net passive movement of a substance from a region of
•
high concentration to a region of low concentration until equilibrium is reached.
Osmosis is the net passive movement of free water from a region of high free
water concentration to a region of low free water concentration across a semi-
permeable membrane until equilibrium is reached.
• Explain: Therefore, because sucrose has a high concentration on the left, it will
•
want to move to the right by diffusion, but it is too large to fit through the holes
in the membrane, so it cannot move. Water, on the other hand, can fit through
the holes and so it moves by osmosis from the right (high free water/low solute
concentration) to the left, where the solute concentration is high.
• Relate back to the question: Due to water moving to the left where the sucrose is and
•
cannot move, the water level on the left will have increased by time 30 minutes.

BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TITLE: I can outline the cellular features of prokaryotes
CODE: 1C.2a

WHAT (concept explanation):
Prokaryotic cells have no membrane-bound organelles, contain ribosomes, have genetic material in a nucleoid region (usually circular DNA), may have plasmids, and have a plasma membrane surrounded by a cell wall.

WHY (importance):
Knowing prokaryotic features helps you identify these cells and understand how they function without the complex organelles found in eukaryotes.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
A bacterium has a cell wall for protection, a plasma membrane, ribosomes for protein synthesis, circular DNA in the nucleoid, and may have flagella for movement and plasmids containing extra genes.

SUBTOPIC: Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic covers the classification of organisms into prokaryotes and eukaryotes based on their cellular structure, particularly the presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Understanding the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is fundamental to biology as it explains the diversity of life and how different organisms have evolved different cellular strategies.

KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE
REQUIRED FOR UNITS 3&4
Introduction
For Units 3 & 4 Biology, it is not a requirement that you have completed Units 1 and/or 2.
However, some key concepts in Units 1 & 2 are fundamental to understanding the processes
studied in the Units 3 & 4 course. Even if you have done Units 1 & 2, you can use this chapter to
revise those key concepts.
This chapter examines cells as the basic structural feature of life on Earth. Prokaryotes (such as
bacteria) and eukaryotes (such as plants and animals) are the two main cell types, and being able
to distinguish between them is an important skill. You will understand that all cells have four
common features – genetic material, plasma membrane, cytosol and ribosomes – and you will
explore the structure and function of the main types of specialised organelles.
A considerable portion of this chapter focuses closely on the structure and function of the plasma
membrane and how it contributes to the functioning of the cell by regulating the movement of
substances into and out of the cell. These substances are crucial to processes that will be explored
throughout this book, including protein synthesis, photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and immunity.

Separating internal and external
The plasma membrane (also known as the cell membrane) acts as a boundary between
the internal environment of a cell and its external environment. Figures 1A–1 and 1A–2
illustrate how the cell membrane helps to determine the two different environments.
Without a plasma membrane a cell would not exist, because the survival of the cell depends
on how substances are exchanged between the internal and external environments.

EXPLAIN
Cell theory
Before we begin discussing the importance of the plasma membrane, it is important to
know that the cell is the basic unit of life, and every cell comes from a pre-existing cell.
This is known as cell theory . The cells of plants, animals, bacteria and amoebas all have the
following four common factors ( Figure 1 A–3):
• genetic material
• cytosol
• ribosomes
• a plasma membrane.
These are summarised in Table 1 A–1.

Structure and function of the plasma membrane
The structure of the plasma membrane relates to its function and the type of cell it is in. It is
a semi-permeable membrane that allows substances to be transported between the internal
and external environments of the cell. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer, proteins,
carbohydrates and cholesterol.
The functions of the plasma membrane include but are not limited to:
• recognising other cells when forming tissue, or determining whether cells are foreign
•
during an immune response
• communicating with other cells
•
• selectively controlling which substances are transported into or out of the cell.
•
The process of transporting substances across the plasma membrane is explored in detail in
Section 1C.

The phospholipid bilayer is arranged with the hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails facing
inwards and the hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads on the outsides of the membrane,
towards the watery internal and external environments. Because the plasma membrane
is made up of phospholipids, it is able to selectively allow different substances to enter
and leave the cell. Water-soluble (hydrophilic) substances need the assistance of a protein
channel to cross the phospholipid part of the membrane. Lipid-soluble (hydrophobic)
substances are able to move across the phospholipids of the plasma membrane.

Description
Phospholipids are arranged in two
layers, with their hydrophilic (water-
attracting) glycerol and phosphate
heads facing outwards, towards
both the intra- and extra-cellular
environments. The hydrophobic (water-
repelling) fatty acid tails face inwards,
towards each other.
Proteins play a variety of roles including
transport, signalling and cell-to-cell
recognition. When they span the length
of the membrane, they are called
transmembrane proteins. When present
on only one side of the membrane, they
are called peripheral proteins.
Carbohydrates play a role in adhesion
between cells and in cell recognition.
When a carbohydrate is attached to
a protein, it is called a glycoprotein.
When a carbohydrate is attached to the
head of a phospholipid, it is called a
glycolipid.

Fluid mosaic model
A plasma membrane is made up of different types (a mosaic) of molecules. It is also fluid –
that is, the phospholipids and proteins are able to move around within each layer. Referring
to plasma membranes in this way is known as the fluid mosaic model (see Figure 1A–5 on
the previous page).
Recall that a phospholipid consists of a head and two tails, and the tails consist of fatty
acids. If these fatty acids are saturated, they have only one bond between each carbon atom,
and this makes them pack together tightly. If there are unsaturated fatty acids in the tails,
they have double bonds between some carbon atoms and this makes them pack together
less tightly. So more unsaturated fatty acids in the tails of the phospholipids increases the
fluidity of the plasma membrane (Figure 1A–6).

SKILLS:
IDENTIFYING
AND EXPLAINING
The difference between ‘identify’ and ‘explain’
The ability to identify the components of a plasma
membrane is a key skill. It is important that you
become familiar with a variety of representations of
the plasma membrane, as different diagrams can be
used during an assessment.
Figure 1A–7 is a representation of a plasma
membrane. If the question asks you to identify
some or all of the components, be succinct and
specific. If the question asks you to explain, this is
the time to elaborate on your answer.

For example:
Question: Identify components A and E from the diagram of the plasma membrane
(Figure 1A–7).
Answer: A= phospholipid, E= cholesterol
This sample response has done exactly what the question required, without elaboration.
Question: Explain how you know whether a component of a plasma membrane is a
glycoprotein or a glycolipid.
Answer: A glycoprotein consists of a carbohydrate chain attached to a protein
molecule, as indicated by C in the diagram. A glycolipid, by comparison, consists of a
carbohydrate chain attached to a phospholipid, as indicated by B in the diagram.
This answer gives an elaborated response that demonstrates the ability to differentiate
between the two components of the plasma membrane. To ensure that the answer is
clear, a comparative term is included (‘by comparison’). The answer also incorporates
specific evidence from the diagram to further demonstrate the correct understanding of
the difference between the two components of the plasma membrane.

Bacteria
Fossil records reveal that bacteria were the first type of organism on Earth, 3.5 billion
years ago. Bacteria are now the most prevalent organism on Earth – an estimated
5 million trillion trillion (that is, a 5 with 30 zeros after it). This means there are more
bacteria on Earth than stars
in the universe. At any one
time, you can find up to 1010
bacteria in your mouth and 1014
bacteria in your gut. Of all the
bacteria, 85% are considered
‘good’ bacteria and 15% ‘bad’
bacteria. Even though the
number of bacteria in your body
outnumbers the number of cells
in your body by about 10 to 1,
bacteria contribute only 1–3% of
your body mass. Bacteria are able

EXPLAIN
Benefits of compartmentalisation within cells
A cell can be thought of as a ‘reaction factory’, a place where many molecules (reactants)
interact to release new products. For a successful reaction, the molecules need to move into
and around the cell at the correct rate. They also need to be in the correct concentration for
specific chemical reactions to occur.
A eukaryotic cell is relatively large, making it more difficult for chemical reactions to occur
efficiently within it. This problem is overcome by having smaller compartments within the
cell. Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within a cell that perform specific
functions. Each organelle (with the exception of ribosomes) has a plasma membrane.
This membrane enables the organelle to maintain the concentrations of molecules at

levels that allow the reactants to interact with each other at optimal rates. The
compartmentalisation that occurs with organelles also allows various chemical
reactions to occur simultaneously in different places without interfering with each
other ( Figure 1B–3 ).
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes
Organisms can be classified into one of two groups: prokaryotes and eukaryotes
(see Figure 1B–2 ). A prokaryote is generally a single-celled organism that does not
contain membrane-bound organelles. Examples of prokaryotic organisms are
bacteria and archaea.
Eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells contain
membrane-bound organelles and are usually much larger than prokaryotic cells.
Examples of eukaryotic organisms are protists, fungi, plants and animals.

It is important to realise that cells do not all have the same types or number of organelles.
The types and numbers of organelles present in a cell are specific to the type of tissue in
which the cell is found. For example, a sperm cell requires a great deal of energy, so you
would expect to find a large number of mitochondria in it, as mitochondria provide energy
for the cell. The secretory cells that line the stomach are part of the digestive system, and
hence they require many Golgi apparatus to enable them to release enzymes that aid in the
breakdown of food molecules.

Comparison of plant and animal cells
Plant cells and animal cells have many organelles in common, but there are some
differences ( Figure 1B–6 ).
A misconception is that plant cells only perform photosynthesis and do not respire. In fact,
plant cells perform both photosynthesis and cellular respiration, and so a plant cell has both
mitochondria and chloroplasts. Not all the cells in a plant photosynthesise (for example,
root cells do not photosynthesise), but they do all have a cell wall. In contrast, animal cells
do not have any chloroplasts, and do not photosynthesise.

Two further key differences between plant cells and animal cells:
• Cell wall – plant cells have a cell wall to aid with structural support for the whole plant,
whereas animal cells do not. Animals have other features, such as exoskeletons or bones,
to provide support.
• Permanent vacuole – plant cells have a permanent large vacuole for the storage of
water, minerals and ions. The vacuole also assists with the structural support of the
cell through turgor pressure (pressure exerted by water). Animal cells do have vacuoles
but they are small and are not permanently present, and they do not provide structural
support to the cell.

QUESTIONS
Using diagrams to answer questions
When providing examples of organisms that are either eukaryotic or prokaryotic, it
is important to use cellular features as your justification. A key cellular feature is the
presence or absence of membrane-bound organelles. If the cell contains a membrane-
bound organelle, then it is a eukaryote.
One type of organism that often causes confusion is protists. A protist is unicellular but
it is not a prokaryote. It is important to remember that some unicellular organisms, such
as paramecium, contain membrane-bound organelles, as shown in Figure 1B–7 . For this
reason, paramecium is classified as a eukaryote.

You could be asked to identify which of the examples are either a prokaryote or
a eukaryote. When a question asks you to identify, there is no need to include a
justification or explanation. All you need to do is put the example into a category, or
label it as either prokaryote or eukaryote.
For example:
Question: Identify which of the diagrams shows a prokaryote.

Answer : C
As you can see, the answer consists of just the letter associated with the correct diagram.
This is in contrast to a question that asks you to justify your choice. For example:
Question: Provide a justification for why you have identified your answer as a
prokaryote.
Answer: C lacks membrane-bound organelles. The other two diagrams show a
nucleus or another membrane-bound organelle. Hence C is a prokaryote.

Note that the answer does not repeat the question, and it gives a specific piece of
evidence as the reason for the choice. The response also finishes off by coming back to
the context of the question, re-stating that the chosen option is a prokaryote.
Creating flashcards
One strategy to help you remember the functions of the organelles is to use the diagrams
and definitions from Table 1B–1 to create flash cards. The more you use images
associated with terms and definitions, the easier it will be for you to correctly recall the
organelle functions.

Transportation across the plasma membrane
One of the main roles of the plasma membrane is to control the entry and exit of
substances between the internal and external environments of the cell. This is essential
for the cell’s survival. Like us, cells need nutrients so that important cellular processes
can occur. For example, they need water (for photosynthesis by plant cells), oxygen
(for aerobic cellular respiration) and amino acids (for protein synthesis). At the same
time, cells must ensure that unwanted substances or waste do not accumulate, so these
substances must be disposed of. Examples are carbon dioxide resulting from cellular
respiration, excess water from condensation reactions that occur in the synthesis of
biomacromolecules, and nitrogenous waste from proteins (such as urea). All these
substances move into and out of the cell through the plasma membrane.

EXPLAIN
The nature of substances
What makes understanding the movement of substances challenging is that they do not all
have the same characteristics. The molecules of some substances are large, some are small,
some are charged and some uncharged, some are polar, some dissolve in water (hydrophilic)
and others dissolve in lipids (lipophilic).
As you progress through this chapter, you will see that several terms can be used
interchangeably. For example, substances that dissolve readily in water (and do not dissolve
readily in lipids) can be described as hydrophilic or lipophobic. In the same way, substances
that dissolve readily in lipids (and do not dissolve readily in water) can be described as
lipophilic or hydrophobic.
NOTE
Lipophobic
does not dissolve
readily in lipids;
also called
hydrophilic
Hydrophilic comes from hydro, which means water, and philic, which means loving. Lipophobic
comes from lipo, which means lipids or fats, and phobic, which means hating.
Hydrophobic comes from hydro, which means water and phobic, which means hating. Lipophilic
comes from lipo, which means lipids or fats, and philic, which means loving.

The different characteristics of the substances being transported mean that these
substances require different ways of transport across the plasma membrane. It is the
different components of the plasma membrane that allow this to happen.
Structural elements of the plasma membrane
In Section 1A, the characteristics of the plasma membrane were described. These include
the phospholipid bilayer, proteins, carbohydrate chains and cholesterol. Movement through
the plasma membrane occurs through two of these structural elements:
• Phospholipid bilayer
•
▶ Lipophilic (hydrophobic) substances
▶
move freely through the phospholipid
Lipids
bilayer due to the hydrophobic
nature of the fatty acid tails of
phospholipids.
Amino acids
▶ Water, gases, and other small
▶
hydrophobic molecules can diffuse
directly across the phospholipid
Water
bilayer.
• Protein channels/carriers
•
▶ Polar or hydrophilic substances pass
▶
through the channel proteins and
carrier proteins.
It is these structural elements that allow the
plasma membrane to be selective about what
moves from one side of the plasma membrane
to the other. Therefore, the plasma
membrane is referred to as being semi-
permeable, or partially permeable, selectively
permeable or differentially permeable.

The movement of substances
The modes of transport of substances across the plasma membrane include simple
diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, active transport and bulk transport.
Biologists classify these forms of transport into two broad categories: passive transport
and active transport. Passive transport does not require energy (in the form of ATP, to be
explained later); active transport does require energy. Table 1C–1 summarises the varied
nature of substances that a cell needs to move across its plasma membrane in order to
survive, the component of the plasma membrane they move through, which mode of
transport is used, and whether this mode of transport is active or passive.

Simple diffusion
The most basic way for substances to move is by simple diffusion (Figure 1C–5). Diffusion
is a type of passive transport, which means it does not require energy. It occurs naturally
in both living and non-living systems. In living systems, diffusion can take place across a
plasma membrane, as long as the molecule can pass through the hydrophobic fatty acid
tails of the phospholipid bilayer. Examples of substances that move by simple diffusion are
oxygen, water, urea, carbon dioxide, alcohol and steroid hormones.

Rate of diffusion
The conditions within a cell can affect the rate or speed at which substances diffuse across
the plasma membrane. Because diffusion is necessary for a cell to survive, the cell requires
optimal conditions so that diffusion is as efficient as possible. Table 1C–2 summarises the
main factors that can affect the rate of diffusion.
Table 1C–2 Factors that affect the rate of diffusion
Factor How diffusion is affected
Size The smaller the molecules of a substance, the higher the rate of diffusion.
Concentration The greater the difference in concentration between the two regions
(known as a concentration gradient ), the higher the rate of diffusion.
Temperature The higher the temperature, the higher the rate of diffusion. When the
temperature increases, the vibrations (kinetic energy) of the molecules
also increase and so it is easier for them to move.
Concentration
gradient
the difference
between the
concentrations
of a substance
in two regions; if
there is a large
difference, the
concentration
gradient is steep
Osmosis
Osmosis is a special case of diffusion: it is the net passive movement of free water from a
region of high free water concentration to a region of low free water concentration across
a semi-permeable membrane, until equilibrium is reached. Did you notice the difference
compared to the definition of diffusion? Osmosis is all about the movement of free water.
Just like diffusion (because it is the diffusion of water), osmosis is a passive process that
requires no input of energy (ATP) to occur.
In Figure 1C–6, there are sugar molecules and water molecules on both sides of the semi-
permeable membrane, which runs down the centre. In the left image, note where the
lowest and highest concentration of sugar molecules are. However they are too big to
pass across the membrane. Also note where the lowest and highest concentration of free
water molecules are. Which way will they diffuse (by osmosis) across the membrane? Now
compare the left image with the right image. What changes have occurred?

28 CHAPTER 1 KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR UNITS 3&4
The free water has moved across the semi-permeable membrane from a region of high
free water concentration to low free water concentration until evenly distributed on both
sides: this is osmosis. Notice that the sugar molecules have not moved, despite there being
a difference in the concentration on each side (concentration gradient). This is because the
sugar molecules are too large to move through this membrane.
Note that when there is a high concentration of free water molecules in a solution, the
solution has a low concentration of solute and is called dilute. If there is a low concentration
of free water molecules in a solution, there is a comparatively higher concentration of solute
and therefore the solution is said to be concentrated. In VCE, there are two definitions
for osmosis: one refers to free water, as discussed above, and one refers to the solute
concentration. In an examination situation, both definitions are equally acceptable as long as
you don’t get them confused. So the alternative definition for osmosis is:
Osmosis is the net passive movement of free water from a region of low solute
concentration to a region of high solute concentration across a semi-permeable
membrane until equilibrium is reached.

Tonicity
Water is the medium in which many of the chemical processes of cells take place. This is
because it is an excellent solvent and can therefore transport a lot of substances (solutes), as
water moves easily through the plasma membrane. As a consequence, the water content of
the solution outside a cell (the cell’s external environment), will affect the conditions inside
the cell (the cell’s internal environment). This is called tonicity. Tonicity means that the
concentration of solutes dissolved in an extracellular solution can determine the direction
and rate of osmosis, and therefore the volume of a cell.

Tonicity in plant cells
In plant cells, diffusion and osmosis work together to cause carbon dioxide and water
(reactants for photosynthesis) to move into the cells, and oxygen and water (products
of photosynthesis) to move out of the cells, via the semi-permeable membrane. These
substances are continuously entering and exiting through the stomata.

Facilitated diffusion
A third type of passive transport is facilitated diffusion. As the name implies, this mode of
transport is diffusion with assistance from a carrier protein or channel protein. These are
the same protein transport molecules you saw earlier, embedded in the plasma membrane.
Again, keep in mind that this process is still diffusion (passive, no energy required, moving
from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration), but it involves

bilayer portion of the plasma membrane. These hydrophilic substances therefore
need help to get across the plasma membrane. Facilitated diffusion is also referred to
as protein-mediated transport.

The term ‘protein-mediated’ means that a carrier protein or channel protein is required for
this mode of transport to occur.
• Carrier proteins are transmembrane proteins that bind to a particular substance and
•
change shape to move the substance across the membrane to the other side. This is
the case with hydrophilic substances such as glucose and amino acids (monomers
of proteins). Carrier proteins are specific to the substance they are transporting and
sometimes are referred to as being selective, in that some molecules are transported
while others are not.
• Channel proteins are transmembrane proteins that allow hydrophilic substances to
•
move through the membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low
concentration.

4 List the similarities between simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion.
5 List the differences between simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion.
Active transport
Active transport is a process used to move substances that are essential for cellular
functioning, such as those involved in maintaining pH balance, regulating cell volume and
the uptake of nutrients. Like passive transport, active transport is a selective process for
moving substances across a membrane, and it occurs in living cells. However, active transport
uses energy, in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) , as the substances are moved from a
region of low substance concentration to a region of high substance concentration. This is the
reverse of the way substances naturally move and become distributed. You will look at ATP
and its role as an energy shuttle in more detail in Chapter 5.
Active transport is a protein-mediated process, just like facilitated diffusion. Every plasma
membrane contains special protein carriers, also called protein pumps, which use ATP as a
fuel for the pump. Some protein carriers transport one substance and some transport two
substances simultaneously, but all are specific for certain substances, and in this way they are
able to regulate the movement of that substance. This is why active transport is considered to
be a selective process. Figure 1C–11 shows the selective nature of the protein carrier and how,
during the transport process, the protein carrier changes shape.

Bulk transport
If the molecules of a substance are too large (or if there are too many molecules) for any
of the forms of transport discussed so far, bulk transport is required. Bulk transport is the
movement of large particles (or large volumes of liquids) through the plasma membrane,
requiring the input of energy (ATP). As the process requires ATP, it is classified as a form
of active transport.
Bulk transport operates differently from other transport processes. It is vesicle mediated
transport, which means it uses membrane-bound structures. This is why cholesterol is such
an important component of the plasma membrane – it allows the membrane to be broken
and remade as substances enter and leave the cell, avoiding the need for a substance to
cross through a particular component of the plasma membrane.
The two main types of bulk transport are endocytosis and exocytosis. The term ‘endocytosis’
comes from endo meaning ‘internal’ and cyte meaning ‘cell’. It is the process in which large
molecules (or large quantities of smaller molecules) enter the cell without crossing the
membrane. In endocytosis:
• the substance, including fluid, moves closer to the plasma membrane
•
• a portion of the plasma membrane is invaginated
•
• the membrane pinches off, forming a membrane-bound vesicle that contains the
•
substance being transported.

If the substance entering the cell is:
• solid (such as a pathogen or food), the process is called phagocytosis ( phago = eating)
• liquid or dissolved, the process is called pinocytosis ( pino = drinking). Pinocytosis occurs
in almost all cells, continuously.
Exocytosis is the reverse of endocytosis ( exo = external). It is the movement of substances
out of the cell without crossing the membrane. In exocytosis:
• the substance to be exported (often protein molecules) is enclosed in a vesicle from the
Golgi apparatus
• the vesicle moves towards and fuses with the plasma membrane
• the vesicle releases its contents into the extracellular fluid.

Figure 1C–13 Exocytosis is a type of active transport in which large substances are moved out of a
cell using vesicles.
The focus of Section 2B is protein synthesis, and Section 2C is about proteins and their
levels of structure and uses in organisms. When proteins are made by the ribosomes (as was
covered earlier in this chapter), they move to the Golgi apparatus for further modification.
If that protein is required for use outside the cell, it is packaged into a vesicle for release by
exocytosis.
As you progress to Unit 4, you will learn about the role of endocytosis in defending your
body against pathogens or disease-causing organisms. Some of your white blood cells have
the job of targeting a pathogen, engulfing it, digesting it and destroying it, thus protecting
your body from further damage. As the white blood cell is taking in a solid substance, this
process is phagocytosis.

How to explain
Command terms are an important component of questions, as they indicate what it is
that you need to do to attain full marks. Explain is an example of a command term used
regularly in exam situations. To explain means to give a detailed account of causes,
reasons or mechanisms, or to essentially say why something happened. Consider the
following question:
Question: Identical pieces of potato (all of the same mass) were placed in each of four
beakers, which contained glucose solution or distilled water (see Figure 1C–14). They
were left for 30 minutes. Explain which piece of potato would have the largest loss in
mass after 30 minutes. (2 marks)

Figure 1C–14 Set-up of a student experiment investigating the loss of mass
from potato
Answer: Beaker A.
• Water moves by osmosis from high water concentration to low water concentration
•
along the concentration gradient across a semi-permeable membrane.
• Therefore, for there to be a loss of mass, water must be moving out of the potato, so
•
high water must be inside the cell and low water outside the cell (beaker A or B).
• Osmosis occurs faster at a higher temperature as the molecules have more
•
kinetic energy.
• Therefore, beaker A will show the greatest loss of mass in the 30 minutes.
•
Notice that this answer is set out in four dot points. This is because you have 2 marks to
score and this often equates to needing four points to gain full marks. Examiners don’t
mark you down in Biology for using dot points in your answer, so if dot points help,
use them.
An acronym you might find useful when answering questions is DER, which stands for:
• Define – include key and relevant definitions in your answer, for key content words
•
• Explain – give a detailed account of causes, reasons or mechanisms relevant to
•
the question
• Relate back to the question – relate your explanation to the information provided in
•
the question so the examiner can clearly see the link.
Here is an example of what this looks like:
Question: A student was carrying out an experiment using an artificial semi-
permeable membrane. The holes in this membrane allow water to pass through, but
not larger molecules like the sugar sucrose. The student added the same amount of
water on each side of the membrane. Then, at time = 0 minutes, they added sucrose
to one side, as shown in Figure 1C–15. Explain what results you would expect at
time = 30 minutes.

Answer: The water level will rise on the left.
• Define – Diffusion is the net passive movement of a substance from a region of
•
high concentration to a region of low concentration until equilibrium is reached.
Osmosis is the net passive movement of free water from a region of high free
water concentration to a region of low free water concentration across a semi-
permeable membrane until equilibrium is reached.
• Explain: Therefore, because sucrose has a high concentration on the left, it will
•
want to move to the right by diffusion, but it is too large to fit through the holes
in the membrane, so it cannot move. Water, on the other hand, can fit through
the holes and so it moves by osmosis from the right (high free water/low solute
concentration) to the left, where the solute concentration is high.
• Relate back to the question: Due to water moving to the left where the sucrose is and
•
cannot move, the water level on the left will have increased by time 30 minutes.

FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
