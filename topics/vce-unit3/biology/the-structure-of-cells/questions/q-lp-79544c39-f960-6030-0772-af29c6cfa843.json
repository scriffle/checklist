      "question": "Some sea slugs can incorporate chloroplasts from ingested algae into their own cells and maintain them for months. Evaluate what this phenomenon reveals about the autonomy of chloroplasts.",
      "correct": "Chloroplasts retain enough independence to function temporarily in a foreign host cell",
      "correctExplanation": "This demonstrates that chloroplasts have sufficient genetic and metabolic independence to carry out photosynthesis even outside their original cell.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This proves that chloroplasts are completely independent organisms", "explanation": "Chloroplasts eventually degrade because they depend on the host nucleus for some essential proteins." },
        { "answer": "The sea slug must have plant DNA to maintain the chloroplasts indefinitely", "explanation": "Some sea slugs have acquired algal genes, but the chloroplasts still degrade over time." },

      "correct": "Separating initial carbon fixation from the Calvin cycle reduces photorespiration",
      "correctExplanation": "C4 plants concentrate CO2 in bundle sheath cells, reducing wasteful photorespiration that occurs when oxygen competes with CO2.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "C4 plants need twice as many chloroplasts to carry out the same amount of photosynthesis", "explanation": "C4 photosynthesis is more efficient in hot conditions, not simply double the chloroplasts." },
        { "answer": "Having chloroplasts in two cell types makes C4 plants less efficient overall", "explanation": "The arrangement makes C4 plants more efficient in hot, dry conditions by reducing photorespiration." },

      "correct": "Chloroplasts have become increasingly dependent on the host cell over time",
      "correctExplanation": "As genes moved to the nucleus, chloroplasts lost the ability to independently produce all the proteins they need, increasing their dependence on the host cell.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Gene transfer proves chloroplasts are not related to cyanobacteria", "explanation": "Gene transfer is expected in endosymbiosis; it supports, rather than contradicts, the cyanobacterial origin." },

      "correct": "Functional photosynthesis requires many coordinated genes, proteins, and structures beyond just chloroplast genes",
      "correctExplanation": "Photosynthesis requires the entire chloroplast structure, pigment systems, and hundreds of coordinated proteins; simply inserting genes would not recreate this complexity.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This would work easily since chloroplast genes are sufficient for photosynthesis", "explanation": "Chloroplast function depends on proteins encoded by both chloroplast and nuclear genes, plus the organelle structure itself." },
        { "answer": "Animal cells already have the machinery to support chloroplasts but lack genes", "explanation": "Animal cells lack the entire infrastructure for photosynthesis, not just the genes." },

      "correct": "Chlorophyll breakdown represents the plant reclaiming nutrients from leaves before they are shed",
      "correctExplanation": "The plant actively degrades chlorophyll and other chloroplast components to recover valuable nitrogen and minerals before dropping leaves.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Chlorophyll breaks down randomly due to cold temperatures damaging chloroplasts", "explanation": "Chlorophyll breakdown is an active, regulated process, not random cold damage." },
        { "answer": "The colour change shows that chloroplasts are converting into different organelles", "explanation": "Chloroplasts degrade; they do not convert into other functional organelles." },
        { "answer": "Autumn colours appear because new pigments are being synthesised to replace chlorophyll", "explanation": "The other pigments were already present but masked by chlorophyll; they are revealed as chlorophyll degrades." }

      "correct": "Each engulfment event adds an additional membrane layer around the chloroplast",
      "correctExplanation": "Primary endosymbiosis gives two membranes; secondary endosymbiosis adds one or two more from the engulfing events, explaining the extra layers.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Extra membranes formed spontaneously to increase photosynthetic efficiency", "explanation": "The extra membranes are a consequence of multiple engulfment events, not efficiency adaptations." },

      "correctExplanation": "While partial reactions can be achieved artificially, the full integration of light and dark reactions within a living system remains beyond current technology.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Artificial chloroplasts prove that natural chloroplasts are unnecessary for photosynthesis", "explanation": "Natural chloroplasts integrate all photosynthetic processes; artificial versions only replicate portions." },

      "correct": "Higher temperatures increase photorespiration, potentially selecting for C4-like mechanisms",
      "correctExplanation": "Warmer conditions favour photorespiration in C3 plants, so adaptations that concentrate CO2 or reduce photorespiration would be advantageous.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Higher temperatures always increase photosynthesis rates without any negative effects", "explanation": "Beyond an optimum temperature, enzyme function declines and photorespiration increases." },
