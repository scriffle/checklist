      "correct": "Both organelles have their own circular DNA and double membranes",
      "correctExplanation": "The presence of circular DNA (like prokaryotes) and a double membrane (the outer from the host cell, inner from the original prokaryote) supports endosymbiosis.",

      "correct": "Both have nuclei and mitochondria, but only the alga has chloroplasts",
      "correctExplanation": "As eukaryotes, both have nuclei and mitochondria. The parasitic protist obtains energy from its host and does not photosynthesise, so lacks chloroplasts.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Neither would have mitochondria since both are unicellular", "explanation": "Being unicellular does not prevent a cell from having mitochondria; all eukaryotes have them." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The claim is correct because lacking a nucleus defines prokaryotes", "explanation": "Classification is based on the organism, not individual cell state; red blood cells develop from nucleated precursors." },

      "correct": "Each cell's organelle composition reflects its specific function in the organism",

        { "answer": "Membrane-bound organelles are unnecessary for basic cell functions", "explanation": "While basic protein synthesis works, complex processes like aerobic respiration require organelles." },
