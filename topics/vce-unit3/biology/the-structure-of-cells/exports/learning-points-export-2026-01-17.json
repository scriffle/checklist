      "why": "This skill is essential for exam questions that show cell diagrams and ask you to classify the cell type with justification.",

      "code": "1D.3",
      "what": "Compartmentalisation refers to the division of a cell into separate membrane-bound compartments (organelles), each maintaining specific conditions for particular chemical reactions.",
      "why": "Compartmentalisation allows multiple different reactions to occur simultaneously without interfering with each other, making cells more efficient.",
      "example": "Without compartmentalisation, digestive enzymes from lysosomes would break down the cell's own proteins. By containing these enzymes within the lysosome membrane, the cell protects itself.",

      "code": "1D.4",
      "what": "Compartmentalisation increases reaction efficiency by concentrating reactants in small spaces, allows incompatible reactions to occur in the same cell, and enables cells to maintain different conditions in different areas.",
      "why": "Eukaryotic cells are relatively large, making compartmentalisation necessary for chemical reactions to occur efficiently.",
      "example": "In a small organelle, reactant molecules are more likely to bump into each other and react than if they were spread throughout the entire cell. This is why mitochondria can efficiently produce ATP.",

      "why": "The nucleus is often called the control centre of the cell because it contains the instructions for making all the proteins the cell needs.",
      "example": "When a cell needs to produce insulin, the instructions in the DNA within the nucleus are first copied into RNA, which then leaves through nuclear pores to reach ribosomes.",
