      "question": "In a DNA profile gel, how many bands does each individual typically show per VNTR region?",
      "correct": "Two bands, one from each homologous chromosome",
      "correctExplanation": "Each person has two alleles at each VNTR region (one from each parent). If the alleles have different repeat numbers, two bands appear at different positions on the gel.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "One band, because DNA profiling only analyses one chromosome", "explanation": "DNA profiling analyses both alleles at each VNTR region. Two bands appear unless the person is homozygous." },
        { "answer": "Thirteen bands, one for each VNTR region", "explanation": "Thirteen regions are analysed, but each region produces up to two bands. The question asks about bands per region." },
        { "answer": "Three bands, one from each parent plus one mixed band", "explanation": "Each parent contributes one allele, producing up to two bands per region. There is no mixed band." }

      "correct": "One band matching the mother and one band matching the biological father at each VNTR region",
      "correctExplanation": "A child inherits one allele from each parent. Therefore, at each VNTR region, one of the child's bands must match a band in the mother's profile and the other must match a band in the father's profile.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "All bands must match the mother only", "explanation": "The child inherits alleles from both parents. Only one band per region matches the mother; the other must come from the father." },
        { "answer": "The child's bands do not need to match either parent", "explanation": "The child's bands must be a combination of parental bands. Each allele in the child must be present in one of the parents." },
        { "answer": "The child's bands must be exactly halfway between the parents' bands", "explanation": "Alleles are inherited as discrete units, not blended. The child has one specific band from each parent, not a midpoint." }

      "correctExplanation": "If the suspect's bands are at the same positions as the crime scene bands at every VNTR region tested, the suspect cannot be excluded as the source of the crime scene DNA.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Count the total number of bands — if the numbers are equal, it is a match", "explanation": "Band count is not sufficient. The bands must be at the same positions, not just the same number." },

      "correctExplanation": "The child must have one allele from each parent. Possible combinations are A+C, A+D, B+C, or B+D. Band E is not present in either parent, so A+E is impossible.",

      "correct": "The person is homozygous — they inherited the same allele from both parents at that region",
      "correctExplanation": "When both alleles have the same number of repeats, both fragments are the same size and co-migrate to one position, appearing as a single band.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The DNA sample was degraded and one band was lost", "explanation": "While possible, the most common explanation for one band is homozygosity — inheriting identical alleles from both parents." },

Two alleged fathers are tested: Father A has 7 and 12, Father B has 12 and 15. At a second region, the child has alleles 3 and 8, the mother has 3 and 6, Father A has 8 and 10, Father B has 4 and 8. Which father is more likely the biological father?",
      "correct": "Both fathers match at both regions, so more VNTR regions need to be tested",
      "correctExplanation": "At region 1: child needs 12 from father (both have 12). At region 2: child needs 8 from father (both have 8). Neither can be excluded based on just two regions. More regions must be analysed.",
