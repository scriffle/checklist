      "correct": "The double-stranded DNA separating into two single strands",
      "correctExplanation": "During denaturation at 90-95°C, heat breaks hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, causing the two DNA strands to separate. A diagram should show the double helix opening into two individual strands.",

      "correctExplanation": "Each primer binds to the 3' end of a different template strand, ensuring that Taq polymerase can extend from each primer toward the other, copying the target region in both directions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both primers bind to the same template strand at the same end", "explanation": "If both primers bound to the same strand, only one strand would be copied. Primers must bind to opposite strands to amplify both." },
        { "answer": "Primers bind randomly anywhere along the template strands", "explanation": "Primers bind to specific complementary sequences on the template, not randomly. Their position determines what region is amplified." },

      "correctExplanation": "DNA strands are antiparallel (one runs 5'→3' and the other 3'→5'). Since DNA polymerase always synthesises 5'→3', and the primers are on opposite strands, the extension arrows must point in opposite directions.",
      "distractors": [
