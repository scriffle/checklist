        { "answer": "6 fragments", "explanation": "6 fragments would mean two fragments per cut, which is not how restriction enzymes work. Each cut divides one fragment into two, giving cuts + 1 total for linear DNA." },

      "correct": "2 fragments",
      "correctExplanation": "When circular DNA is cut, the number of fragments equals the number of cuts. Two cuts in circular DNA produce 2 fragments because the ends are already connected in a circle.",

      "correct": "Circular DNA has no free ends, so one cut only opens the circle into a single linear fragment",
      "correctExplanation": "Linear DNA has two free ends, so one cut divides it into two separate pieces. Circular DNA is a closed loop with no free ends, so one cut simply opens it into a single linear piece.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Circular DNA is smaller and can only be cut into one piece", "explanation": "The size of the DNA does not determine the number of fragments. The difference is due to the circular shape having no free ends." },
        { "answer": "Restriction enzymes work differently on circular DNA than on linear DNA", "explanation": "The enzyme works the same way regardless of DNA shape. The difference in fragment number comes from the topology (linear vs circular) of the DNA molecule." },
        { "answer": "Circular DNA repairs itself after being cut", "explanation": "DNA does not self-repair after restriction enzyme cutting. The single fragment is produced because opening a circle at one point creates one linear piece." }
