      "question": "Why are sticky end restriction enzymes preferred over blunt end enzymes in gene cloning?",
      "correct": "They produce specific overhangs that allow controlled joining of fragments",
      "correctExplanation": "Sticky ends have complementary overhanging nucleotides that base-pair with matching overhangs, making the joining of DNA fragments specific and controlled rather than random.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "They cut DNA into smaller fragments than blunt end enzymes", "explanation": "Fragment size depends on where the recognition site occurs in the DNA, not on whether the enzyme produces sticky or blunt ends." },
        { "answer": "They work faster than blunt end enzymes", "explanation": "The preference for sticky ends is about specificity of joining, not enzyme speed." },
        { "answer": "They do not require DNA ligase to seal the fragments", "explanation": "DNA ligase is still required to form phosphodiester bonds between fragments, even when sticky ends are used." }

      "type": "MC",
      "question": "What must be true for two sticky end fragments to join together?",
      "correct": "They must have complementary overhanging nucleotides",
      "correctExplanation": "Sticky ends join through complementary base pairing between the single-stranded overhangs, so the overhangs must be complementary for hydrogen bonds to form.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "They must come from the same organism", "explanation": "Fragments from different organisms can join as long as they have complementary sticky ends, which is the basis of recombinant DNA technology." },
        { "answer": "They must be the same length", "explanation": "Fragment length does not determine whether sticky ends can join; complementary overhangs are what matters." },

    {
      "type": "MC",
      "question": "In gene cloning, why are the plasmid and the gene of interest usually cut with the same restriction enzyme?",
      "correct": "So that both fragments have complementary sticky ends that can join",
      "correctExplanation": "Using the same enzyme ensures both the plasmid and the gene of interest have matching overhangs, allowing them to join specifically through complementary base pairing.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "So that both fragments are exactly the same size", "explanation": "The plasmid and gene insert will be different sizes; using the same enzyme ensures complementary ends, not equal sizes." },
        { "answer": "So that the enzyme can also act as DNA ligase", "explanation": "Restriction enzymes only cut DNA; DNA ligase is a separate enzyme needed to seal the joined fragments." },

      "correct": "Sticky ends are preferred for specificity, not bond strength; DNA ligase creates the same covalent bonds in both cases",
      "correctExplanation": "The advantage of sticky ends is that complementary overhangs provide specificity through base pairing. Once DNA ligase seals the join, the covalent phosphodiester bonds formed are identical whether sticky or blunt ends were used.",

      "correct": "The HindIII overhangs on the insulin gene are complementary to those on the plasmid, so they base-pair specifically",
      "correctExplanation": "Because both are cut with HindIII, the single-stranded overhangs on the insulin gene fragment are complementary to those on the linearised plasmid, allowing them to anneal through hydrogen bonding before DNA ligase seals the join.",

        { "answer": "HindIII only cuts the plasmid once, so the insulin gene must fill the gap", "explanation": "While cutting the plasmid once is important, the reason for using the same enzyme is to generate complementary sticky ends, not to create a gap." },
