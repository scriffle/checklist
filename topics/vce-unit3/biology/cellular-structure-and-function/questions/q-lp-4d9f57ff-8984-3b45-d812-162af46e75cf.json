      "question": "What does compartmentalisation mean in the context of eukaryotic cells?",
      "correct": "The separation of cellular processes into membrane-bound organelles",
      "correctExplanation": "Compartmentalisation refers to the division of the cell into distinct membrane-enclosed compartments (organelles), each with a specific function.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The division of a cell into two daughter cells", "explanation": "Cell division is a separate process; compartmentalisation refers to the internal organisation of a single cell into organelles." },
        { "answer": "The storage of all molecules in the nucleus", "explanation": "The nucleus stores DNA; compartmentalisation involves distributing different functions across multiple organelles." },
        { "answer": "The removal of organelles from the cell", "explanation": "Compartmentalisation involves having organelles, not removing them; it is about organising reactions into separate spaces." }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "multipleChoice",
      "question": "How does compartmentalisation increase reaction efficiency?",
      "correct": "By concentrating reactants in a small space so they collide more often",
      "correctExplanation": "In a small organelle, reactant molecules are closer together and more likely to encounter each other, increasing the rate of chemical reactions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "By spreading reactants across the entire cell to cover more area", "explanation": "Spreading reactants would decrease their concentration and lower reaction rates; compartmentalisation concentrates them." },
        { "answer": "By removing all water from the reaction space", "explanation": "Water is essential for many reactions; compartmentalisation increases efficiency through concentration, not dehydration." },
        { "answer": "By heating the organelles to speed up reactions", "explanation": "Organelles do not generate extra heat; efficiency comes from concentrating reactants in small volumes." }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "multipleChoice",
      "question": "Why is compartmentalisation particularly important for eukaryotic cells?",
      "correct": "Because eukaryotic cells are relatively large, making it necessary to organise reactions efficiently",
      "correctExplanation": "Eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotic cells, so without compartmentalisation, reactants would be too dilute for efficient reactions.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because eukaryotic cells are too small for all reactions to fit", "explanation": "Eukaryotic cells are larger than prokaryotes; compartmentalisation is needed because of their large size, not small size." },
        { "answer": "Because eukaryotic cells have fewer types of molecules than prokaryotic cells", "explanation": "Eukaryotic cells have more complex molecular needs; compartmentalisation helps manage diverse reactions in a large cell." },
        { "answer": "Because eukaryotic cells cannot perform chemical reactions without organelles", "explanation": "Some reactions occur in the cytoplasm; compartmentalisation makes reactions more efficient, not solely possible." }

    {
      "type": "multipleChoice",
      "question": "What advantage does compartmentalisation provide for incompatible chemical reactions?",
      "correct": "It allows incompatible reactions to occur simultaneously in different organelles",
      "correctExplanation": "Membrane-bound organelles keep conflicting reactions separate, so processes that would interfere with each other can occur at the same time in the same cell.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It prevents the cell from carrying out more than one reaction at a time", "explanation": "Compartmentalisation allows multiple reactions simultaneously; it does not limit them." },
        { "answer": "It forces all reactions to use the same enzymes in the cytoplasm", "explanation": "Compartmentalisation separates reactions into different organelles with specialised enzymes, not into a shared space." },
        { "answer": "It eliminates the need for enzymes by keeping reactants apart", "explanation": "Enzymes are still required within each compartment; compartmentalisation organises where reactions occur." }

      "question": "How does compartmentalisation allow cells to maintain different conditions in different areas?",
      "correct": "Each organelle can have a different pH, ion concentration, or enzyme set within its membrane",
      "correctExplanation": "Membranes around organelles create enclosed environments where conditions like pH and enzyme concentrations can be independently regulated.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The cell changes its overall pH to match whichever reaction is most important", "explanation": "The cell does not change its entire pH; organelles individually maintain different conditions within their membranes." },
        { "answer": "All areas of the cell have identical conditions regardless of compartmentalisation", "explanation": "Different organelles maintain distinct internal conditions; this is a key benefit of compartmentalisation." },
