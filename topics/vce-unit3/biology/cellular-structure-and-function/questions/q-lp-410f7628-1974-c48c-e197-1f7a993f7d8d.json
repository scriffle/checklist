      "sentence": "Cell theory states that all living things are made of cells, implying that all cells must have the four common factors. If a structure lacks {{blank:1}}, it cannot independently synthesise proteins and is not considered a living cell.",

      "question": "How does understanding the four common factors help scientists identify extraterrestrial life?",
      "correct": "It provides criteria for distinguishing living from non-living matter, though different biochemistry might apply",
      "correctExplanation": "While Earth-based criteria may not perfectly apply, the concept of universal life requirements guides the search.",

        {"answer": "Any extraterrestrial life must have identical factors to Earth life", "explanation": "Life elsewhere might use different biochemistry while serving similar functions."},
        {"answer": "The four factors prove life cannot exist elsewhere in the universe", "explanation": "The factors are Earth-based; life elsewhere could have analogous but different factors."},
        {"answer": "Extraterrestrial life would definitely have different factors", "explanation": "We don't know; some factors like information storage might be universal."}

      "correct": "Internal conditions can no longer be maintained, causing enzyme dysfunction and cessation of vital reactions",
      "correctExplanation": "Without membrane control, optimal concentrations can't be maintained, leading to metabolic failure.",

        {"answer": "Ribosomes would immediately stop functioning", "explanation": "Ribosomes could still function briefly, but the changing environment would eventually affect them."},

        {"answer": "The cell would switch to anaerobic respiration", "explanation": "This might occur, but the fundamental issue is loss of environmental control."}

      "correct": "Despite vast differences in complexity, both share the same fundamental requirements, showing life's universal foundation",
      "correctExplanation": "This suggests all Earth life shares common ancestry and fundamental processes.",
      "distractors": [
        {"answer": "Human cells have more advanced versions of all four factors", "explanation": "The factors serve the same basic functions; 'advanced' implies qualitative differences that don't exist."},
        {"answer": "Bacteria have simpler factors that perform fewer functions", "explanation": "The four factors perform the same essential functions in both cell types."},
        {"answer": "The similarity is coincidental due to convergent evolution", "explanation": "The similarity indicates common ancestry, not convergent evolution."}

      "question": "Evaluate why ribosomes are non-membrane-bound while still being considered essential organelles in the four common factors.",
      "correct": "Their function in protein synthesis is more important than their structure; they work freely in cytosol or attached to ER",
      "correctExplanation": "Ribosomes need to access mRNA anywhere in the cell, making membrane-bound status unnecessary.",
      "distractors": [
        {"answer": "Ribosomes are too small to have a membrane", "explanation": "Size isn't the determining factor; function determines structure."},
        {"answer": "Membrane-bound ribosomes would be unable to read genetic code", "explanation": "Ribosomes attached to ER still function; membrane doesn't prevent function."},
        {"answer": "All four common factors must be non-membrane-bound", "explanation": "The plasma membrane is membrane-based; the factors vary in their structures."}

        {"answer": "The four factors are absolute and will never need revision", "explanation": "Scientific understanding evolves; future discoveries could change our definitions."},
