    {
      "type": "MC",

      "correct": "Because the product (tryptophan) inhibits its own production — the output of the system reduces its own input",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because the product (tryptophan) stimulates more of its own production — the output amplifies itself", "explanation": "This describes positive feedback. In the trp operon, tryptophan inhibits, not stimulates, its own production." },

      "correct": "Tryptophan levels would gradually decrease as the cell uses tryptophan for protein synthesis without producing more",

      "distractors": [
