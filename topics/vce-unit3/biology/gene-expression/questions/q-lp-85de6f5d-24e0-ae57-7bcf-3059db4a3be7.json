      "question": "When tryptophan levels are low in a prokaryotic cell, what is the state of the trp repressor protein?",
      "correct": "The repressor is inactive and cannot bind to the operator",
      "correctExplanation": "Without tryptophan acting as a corepressor, the repressor protein remains in an inactive shape that cannot bind to the operator region of the trp operon.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The repressor is active and bound to the operator", "explanation": "This describes the state when tryptophan is high. When tryptophan is low, the repressor lacks its corepressor and remains inactive." },
        { "answer": "The repressor is destroyed by enzymes in the cytoplasm", "explanation": "The repressor is not destroyed when tryptophan is low. It simply remains in an inactive conformation that cannot bind the operator." },
        { "answer": "The repressor binds to the promoter instead of the operator", "explanation": "The repressor does not bind to the promoter in either state. When tryptophan is low, the repressor is inactive and does not bind to any DNA region." }

      "type": "MC",
      "question": "What happens to the trp operon when tryptophan levels are low?",
      "correct": "The operon is switched on and the structural genes are transcribed",
      "correctExplanation": "With the repressor inactive, the operator is unblocked, allowing RNA polymerase to bind the promoter and transcribe the five structural genes.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The operon is switched off and no enzymes are produced", "explanation": "The operon is switched off when tryptophan is high. Low tryptophan means the cell needs to make more, so the operon is switched on." },
        { "answer": "Only the first two structural genes are transcribed", "explanation": "When the operon is on, all five structural genes are transcribed together as a single mRNA. Selective transcription of individual genes does not occur." },
        { "answer": "The operon produces repressor proteins instead of enzymes", "explanation": "The operon's structural genes always code for tryptophan synthesis enzymes, not repressor proteins. The repressor is produced by a separate regulatory gene." }

    {
      "type": "MC",
      "question": "Which enzyme binds to the promoter of the trp operon when tryptophan levels are low?",
      "correct": "RNA polymerase",
      "correctExplanation": "When the operator is free (no repressor bound), RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and proceed to transcribe the structural genes.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "DNA polymerase", "explanation": "DNA polymerase is involved in DNA replication, not transcription. RNA polymerase binds the promoter to transcribe the operon's genes." },

    {
      "type": "MC",

      "correct": "Because low tryptophan means the repressor is inactive, allowing transcription to proceed",
      "correctExplanation": "The operon is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism. Low tryptophan leaves the repressor inactive, so the structural genes are transcribed and enzymes are produced to make more tryptophan.",
      "distractors": [

        { "answer": "Because the cell detects low tryptophan and sends a chemical signal to the operon", "explanation": "There is no separate signalling pathway. The regulation is direct: tryptophan itself acts as the corepressor that controls the repressor's ability to bind the operator." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The enzymes produced by the operon directly destroy the operon's DNA", "explanation": "The enzymes do not damage DNA. Negative feedback occurs because accumulated tryptophan activates the repressor, which blocks further enzyme production." },

      "correctExplanation": "In a repressible operon, the default state is active transcription. The operon is repressed when the product (tryptophan) reaches sufficient levels. Inducible operons are the opposite: normally off and switched on by a signal.",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The operon would be switched off because the cell cannot make tryptophan without it", "explanation": "The operon is the mechanism for making tryptophan. Without tryptophan available, the operon is maximally active to produce the enzymes needed for synthesis." },
        { "answer": "The operon would alternate between on and off states randomly", "explanation": "Operon regulation is not random. Without tryptophan, the repressor is consistently inactive, keeping the operon steadily on." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Tryptophan production would stop entirely because the operator is essential for gene expression", "explanation": "The operator controls repression, not activation. A non-functional operator means transcription cannot be blocked, so the genes are always expressed." },
