        { "answer": "Prokaryotes have more DNA than eukaryotes and need operons to organise it", "explanation": "Prokaryotes generally have less DNA than eukaryotes. Operons exist because they provide efficient coordinated gene expression, not because of genome size." },
        { "answer": "Eukaryotic RNA polymerase cannot transcribe multiple genes at once", "explanation": "The reason is not about RNA polymerase capability. Eukaryotes process each gene's mRNA individually with modifications like splicing, making polycistronic mRNA impractical." }

      "correct": "A single mRNA ensures all five enzymes are produced in equal amounts at the same time",

      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The argument is completely correct because external tryptophan fully replaces the operon's function", "explanation": "External supply only works while tryptophan is available. The deletion creates a permanent dependency and vulnerability if environmental conditions change." },

      "correct": "The cell would waste energy producing unnecessary enzymes when tryptophan is already available",

      "correctExplanation": "The five enzymes each catalyse different reactions and require specific tertiary structures. Fusing them into one polypeptide would disrupt their individual folding and likely prevent proper catalytic activity.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "A fused protein would be too large for the ribosome to translate", "explanation": "Ribosomes can translate very large proteins. The problem is not translation capacity but the disruption of individual enzyme structures and functions." },
        { "answer": "A fused protein would be exported from the cell before it could function", "explanation": "Prokaryotic enzyme export depends on signal sequences, not protein size. The issue is that fused domains would likely interfere with each enzyme's proper folding." },

      "correct": "A repressor binding the second operator could block transcription of only the last two genes while the first three are still expressed",
      "correctExplanation": "The second operator would create an internal checkpoint. If a repressor binds there, RNA polymerase would be blocked partway through, allowing only the first three genes to be transcribed.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both operators would need to be blocked simultaneously for any repression to occur", "explanation": "Each operator acts independently. Blocking the first would prevent all transcription, while blocking only the second would still allow the first three genes to be expressed." },
        { "answer": "The second operator would have no effect because operons can only have one operator", "explanation": "While natural operons typically have one operator, an inserted operator sequence can still bind repressor proteins. There is no molecular rule preventing a second binding site from functioning." },
        { "answer": "RNA polymerase would skip the second operator and continue transcribing all five genes", "explanation": "A repressor bound to the second operator would physically block RNA polymerase, just as it would at the first operator. RNA polymerase cannot bypass a bound repressor." }
