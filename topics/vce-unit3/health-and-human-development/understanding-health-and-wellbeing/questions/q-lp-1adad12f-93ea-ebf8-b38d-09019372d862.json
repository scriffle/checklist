      "correct": "Socially, it means fewer people depend on health services, and economically, it reduces the financial burden on the government healthcare budget",
      "correctExplanation": "Reduced reliance has dual benefits: socially, people are more independent and less dependent on services; economically, less demand for healthcare reduces government spending, freeing funds for other priorities.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It is only a social benefit because it relates to people's independence", "explanation": "It has both social (independence from services) and economic (reduced government spending) dimensions." },
