    { "type": "mc", "question": "A public health researcher proposes that alcohol advertising should be banned entirely to reduce consumption. Evaluate this proposal considering Australia's current alcohol landscape.", "correct": "An advertising ban could reduce normalisation and appeal, but must be weighed against industry resistance, enforcement challenges, and the need for complementary measures", "correctExplanation": "Advertising bans could reduce alcohol's cultural normalisation, but effectiveness depends on implementation alongside other measures like pricing, availability restrictions, and education.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "An advertising ban would solve all alcohol-related health problems", "explanation": "Advertising is one factor; multiple complementary measures are needed." }, { "answer": "Advertising has no effect on alcohol consumption", "explanation": "Evidence links advertising to consumption patterns, particularly among young people." }, { "answer": "Advertising bans are impossible to implement for any product", "explanation": "Australia has successfully implemented advertising restrictions for tobacco, demonstrating feasibility." }] },
