    { "type": "mc", "question": "Compare the usefulness of DALYs versus life expectancy for understanding the health impact of chronic conditions like depression. Which measure provides more insight?", "correct": "DALYs provide more insight because they capture the disability burden (YLD) of depression, while life expectancy only measures years alive and misses the impact on quality of life", "correctExplanation": "Life expectancy does not capture depression's impact because depression primarily reduces quality of life, not length. DALYs through YLD quantify this non-fatal burden.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "Life expectancy is more useful because it captures all health impacts", "explanation": "Life expectancy misses non-fatal conditions; DALYs capture both fatal and non-fatal burden." }, { "answer": "Neither measure can assess depression's health impact", "explanation": "DALYs, particularly the YLD component, effectively measure depression's burden." }, { "answer": "Both measures provide identical information about depression", "explanation": "Life expectancy misses depression's non-fatal impact while DALYs capture it through YLD." }] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "Evaluate the potential consequences of health policy that focuses exclusively on reducing YLL (preventing premature death) while neglecting YLD (disability).", "correct": "People would live longer but potentially with poor quality of life, increasing the gap between life expectancy and HALE", "correctExplanation": "Focusing only on preventing death without addressing disability would extend life but not healthy life, widening the life expectancy-HALE gap.", "distractors": [{ "answer": "There would be no negative consequences because preventing death is always sufficient", "explanation": "Preventing death without addressing disability leaves people living longer in poor health." }, { "answer": "YLD would automatically decrease if YLL is reduced", "explanation": "Reducing YLL can actually increase YLD if survivors live with disability." }, { "answer": "Quality of life is unimportant as long as people live longer", "explanation": "Quality of life is a fundamental health goal alongside extending life." }] },
