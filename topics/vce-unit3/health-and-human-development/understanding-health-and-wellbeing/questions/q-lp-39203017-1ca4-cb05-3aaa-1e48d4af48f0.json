      "correctExplanation": "Optimal health enables consistent work attendance and productive contribution, which supports income stability and career development.",
      "distractors": [

      "correctExplanation": "When individuals spend less on medical care, they have more resources for education, recreation and other pursuits — demonstrating how health functions as a resource that enables participation in life.",
      "distractors": [
