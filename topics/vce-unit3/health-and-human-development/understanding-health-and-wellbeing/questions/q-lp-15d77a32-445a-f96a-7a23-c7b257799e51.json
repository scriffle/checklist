      "correct": "A resource for everyday life",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The main goal of living", "explanation": "This reverses the Ottawa Charter's key idea. Health is described as a resource that supports life, not the objective of living." },

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Why does the Ottawa Charter describe health as a 'resource' rather than an 'objective'?",
      "correct": "Because health enables people to do the things that matter to them",
      "correctExplanation": "The Ottawa Charter frames health as something that supports participation in work, education, socialising and community life — it is what allows people to pursue their goals.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because health cannot be measured accurately", "explanation": "Health can be measured through various indicators. The reason it is called a resource is that it enables participation in everyday life." },
        { "answer": "Because only doctors can define health", "explanation": "Health is not limited to medical definitions. The Ottawa Charter calls it a resource because it enables people to participate fully in life." },
