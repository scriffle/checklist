  "name": "Benefits of Optimal Health and Wellbeing",
  "icon": "🌏",
  "what": "This subtopic covers the concept of health as a resource for everyday life, and the benefits of optimal health and wellbeing at the individual, national, and global levels. It draws on the Ottawa Charter's framing of health as enabling participation rather than being an end in itself.",
  "why": "Understanding the flow-on benefits from individual to national to global levels is essential for explaining why health promotion programs exist and why governments invest in population health.",

      "title": "I can explain health as a resource for everyday life rather than the objective of living",
      "code": "3.1",
      "what": "The Ottawa Charter (1986) describes health as a resource that enables people to participate in society, work, learn, socialise, and contribute to their communities. Health is not the end goal — it is what allows people to do the things that matter to them.",
      "why": "This concept frames the entire discussion of benefits. It explains why optimal health matters — not for its own sake, but because it enables full participation in life.",
      "example": "A person does not pursue good health just to be healthy. They pursue it because good health allows them to study for their VCE, play sport with friends, work toward career goals, and engage with their community. A person with a physical disability may have a different 'optimal' than an elite athlete, but both can experience equilibrium that enables a full, engaged life.",

      "title": "I can describe benefits of optimal health and wellbeing for individuals",
      "code": "3.2",
      "what": "Individual benefits include reduced risk of illness and premature death, increased life expectancy, adequate energy for daily tasks, reduced personal medical costs, capacity to work productively, ability to gain education, capacity to form satisfying relationships, and a sense of purpose and fulfilment.",
      "why": "Individual benefits form the foundation for understanding national and global benefits, since population-level outcomes are the sum of individual outcomes.",
      "example": "An individual experiencing optimal health and wellbeing is more likely to attend work consistently, earn a stable income, and require less medical care — reducing personal healthcare costs and fewer days missed from work or school.",

      "title": "I can describe social and economic benefits of optimal health for the nation",
      "code": "3.3",
      "what": "National social benefits include increased community engagement, greater social cohesion, and reduced reliance on the healthcare system. National economic benefits include increased productivity, higher tax revenue, reduced government spending on healthcare and social security, and funds that can be redirected to other priorities.",
      "why": "Exam questions often ask students to link individual health to national outcomes. Being able to trace the pathway from individual benefit to national economic or social benefit demonstrates higher-order thinking.",
      "example": "When more Australians experience optimal health, more people can work productively, which increases national productivity and tax revenue. This additional tax revenue can be reinvested in education, infrastructure, and health-promoting services, while government spending on Medicare, hospital admissions, and Centrelink payments decreases.",

      "title": "I can describe global benefits of optimal health and wellbeing",
      "code": "3.4",
      "what": "Global benefits include reduced risk of communicable disease transmission between countries, promotion of global peace and security, a stronger global economy, advancement of sustainable development, and improved educational outcomes that create a virtuous cycle across generations.",
      "why": "Understanding global benefits connects health to broader themes of international development and sustainability, which are relevant across Units 3 and 4.",
      "example": "When populations experience optimal health globally, the risk of pandemics decreases because communicable diseases are less likely to spread between countries. Healthy populations are also more economically stable and less vulnerable to conflict, contributing to global peace and security.",
