    {"type":"mc","question":"What does the tongue map claim?","correct":"That different areas of the tongue taste different things","correctExplanation":"The tongue map is a diagram showing specific taste zones: sweet at the tip, salty on the sides, sour further back, and bitter at the back.","distractors":[{"answer":"That the tongue can only taste sweet and salty flavours","explanation":"The tongue map claims all five tastes are detected but in specific zones, not that only two tastes exist."},{"answer":"That taste buds are found only on the tip of the tongue","explanation":"The tongue map shows taste buds across the tongue but claims different areas specialise in different tastes."},{"answer":"That the tongue cannot detect any tastes at all","explanation":"The tongue map claims the tongue does detect tastes but in specific zones. The myth is about zone locations, not taste detection."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Is the tongue map scientifically correct?","correct":"No, it is a myth — all tastes can be detected anywhere on the tongue","correctExplanation":"Taste receptors for all five basic tastes are distributed across the entire tongue surface. You can taste any taste at any location.","distractors":[{"answer":"Yes, it is completely accurate and proven by modern science","explanation":"Modern research has shown the tongue map is incorrect. All areas of the tongue can detect all five tastes."},{"answer":"Yes, but only for adults — children taste differently","explanation":"The tongue map is incorrect for people of all ages. Taste receptors for all tastes are found across the entire tongue."},{"answer":"It was correct in the past but evolution has changed how tongues work","explanation":"The tongue map was never accurate. The original research it was based on was misinterpreted."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Where are taste receptors for the five basic tastes actually located?","correct":"Distributed across the entire surface of the tongue","correctExplanation":"Taste receptors for sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami are found across the entire tongue, not in specific zones.","distractors":[{"answer":"Only at the very tip of the tongue","explanation":"Taste receptors are found across the entire tongue surface, not just at the tip."},{"answer":"Only at the back of the tongue near the throat","explanation":"While the back of the tongue has taste receptors, they are also found across the entire tongue surface."},{"answer":"Only on the sides of the tongue","explanation":"Taste receptors are distributed across the whole tongue, not only on the sides."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What simple experiment can disprove the tongue map?","correct":"Placing salt on the tip of the tongue and observing that you taste it immediately","correctExplanation":"If the tongue map were correct, you should not taste salt at the tip. But placing salt there produces an immediate salty taste, disproving the map.","distractors":[{"answer":"Looking at the tongue in a mirror to see different coloured zones","explanation":"Taste zones are not visible. The tongue map is disproved by tasting different substances at different locations."},{"answer":"Counting the number of taste buds on each part of the tongue","explanation":"While taste bud density varies slightly, the key evidence is that all tastes can be detected at all locations."},{"answer":"Measuring the temperature of different parts of the tongue","explanation":"Temperature has nothing to do with the tongue map. Placing tastes at different locations disproves it."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How did the tongue map myth originate?","correct":"From a misinterpretation of research showing slight sensitivity differences across the tongue","correctExplanation":"Original research showed minor variations in sensitivity, not exclusive zones. The data was misrepresented as a map showing each area tastes only one thing.","distractors":[{"answer":"It was invented by a food company to sell more products","explanation":"The myth came from misinterpreted scientific research, not commercial interests."},{"answer":"It was discovered by ancient Greek scientists thousands of years ago","explanation":"The tongue map originated from a misinterpretation of 19th-century German research, not ancient science."},{"answer":"It was created by a teacher who needed a simple diagram for students","explanation":"While teachers spread the myth, it originated from misinterpreted scientific research on taste sensitivity."}]},

Taste receptors for all five basic tastes are distributed across the entire tongue surface.","distractors":[{"answer":"True","explanation":"Modern research has clearly shown that all areas of the tongue can detect all five basic tastes."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"You can taste salt on the tip of your tongue, disproving the tongue map.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"The tongue map claims saltiness is only detected on the sides. Tasting salt at the tip demonstrates that all tastes can be detected across the entire tongue.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"You can indeed taste salt at the tip of your tongue. This simple experiment disproves the tongue map's claim about taste zones."}]},

    {"type":"mc","question":"Why did the tongue map persist in textbooks for so long despite being incorrect?","correct":"It was a simple, easy-to-teach diagram that seemed logical and was rarely questioned","correctExplanation":"The tongue map was visually appealing and easy to understand, so it was copied between textbooks without teachers or publishers checking the original research.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because it was repeatedly confirmed by modern scientific studies","explanation":"Modern studies have consistently disproved the tongue map. It persisted due to being unquestioned, not confirmed."},{"answer":"Because the government mandated it be taught in all schools","explanation":"There was no government mandate. It persisted because it was a convenient teaching tool that was rarely questioned."},{"answer":"Because no scientist ever tried to test whether it was true","explanation":"Scientists did test it and found it incorrect. The problem was that educators did not update their materials."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What did the original research actually show about taste sensitivity across the tongue?","correct":"Very small differences in sensitivity between areas, with all areas able to detect all tastes","correctExplanation":"The original research found minor variations — some areas were slightly more sensitive to certain tastes — but all areas could detect all five tastes.","distractors":[{"answer":"That each area could only detect exactly one taste and nothing else","explanation":"The original research never claimed exclusive zones. All areas detected all tastes with only minor sensitivity differences."},{"answer":"That the tongue has no taste receptors and all taste occurs in the nose","explanation":"The research confirmed taste receptors across the tongue. The myth arose from misinterpreting the distribution, not denying it."},{"answer":"That taste receptors are found only in the throat, not on the tongue at all","explanation":"The research found taste receptors across the tongue. Some receptors exist elsewhere, but the tongue is the primary taste organ."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How does knowing the tongue map is a myth change our understanding of sensory evaluation?","correct":"It confirms that all tasters experience the same tastes regardless of where food contacts the tongue","correctExplanation":"Since all taste receptors are everywhere, food placement on the tongue does not affect which tastes are detected, making sensory testing more reliable.","distractors":[{"answer":"It has no impact on sensory evaluation because the tongue map was never relevant","explanation":"Understanding correct taste receptor distribution helps design valid sensory tests and interpret results accurately."},{"answer":"It means sensory evaluation is impossible because we cannot trust any taste information","explanation":"Disproving the tongue map strengthens taste science by establishing correct receptor distribution."},{"answer":"It means only trained scientists can conduct sensory evaluation, not students","explanation":"Anyone can conduct sensory evaluation. Understanding correct tongue physiology improves test design."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why is it important to correct misconceptions like the tongue map in food science education?","correct":"Because accurate scientific knowledge is the foundation for understanding how taste and flavour work","correctExplanation":"Building food science understanding on incorrect foundations like the tongue map leads to flawed reasoning about taste, flavour, and food evaluation.","distractors":[{"answer":"It is not important because the tongue map does not affect practical cooking skills","explanation":"Understanding taste physiology correctly is important for food science, sensory evaluation, and critical thinking."},{"answer":"Because correcting myths earns extra marks in exams but has no real-world value","explanation":"Scientific accuracy matters beyond exams. Correct understanding improves food evaluation and critical thinking skills."},{"answer":"Because students who believe the tongue map will become physically ill","explanation":"The tongue map does not cause illness. Its correction is important for scientific literacy and accurate understanding."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"If a classmate insists the tongue map is real because they learned it in primary school, how should you respond?","correct":"Explain that the map was based on misinterpreted research and can be easily disproved by tasting salt on the tongue tip","correctExplanation":"Providing the scientific evidence and a simple experiment allows the classmate to test the claim themselves and understand why the map is incorrect.","distractors":[{"answer":"Accept their claim because anything taught in school must be correct","explanation":"Not everything taught in school is accurate. The tongue map is a well-known example of a persistent educational misconception."},{"answer":"Ignore them because correcting misconceptions is not important","explanation":"Correcting scientific misconceptions is important for developing accurate understanding and critical thinking."},{"answer":"Argue that taste does not exist at all since the tongue map is wrong","explanation":"Disproving the tongue map does not disprove taste. Taste receptors work correctly; they are just not arranged in zones."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How does the tongue map myth illustrate the importance of checking sources in science?","correct":"It shows how a misinterpretation can become widely accepted if sources are not verified","correctExplanation":"The tongue map spread because people copied it without checking the original research. This demonstrates why primary sources should always be verified.","distractors":[{"answer":"It shows that all scientific research is unreliable and cannot be trusted","explanation":"The original research was valid. The problem was misinterpretation and lack of source checking, not unreliable science."},{"answer":"It proves that diagrams in textbooks are always wrong","explanation":"Many textbook diagrams are accurate. The tongue map is an example of why sources should be verified, not why all diagrams are wrong."},{"answer":"It demonstrates that myths are always more accurate than scientific research","explanation":"The opposite — the myth was incorrect while the original research (properly interpreted) was accurate."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"The original research on tongue sensitivity found only minor differences between areas, not exclusive taste zones.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"The research found all areas detect all tastes, with only slight sensitivity variations. The tongue map exaggerated these minor differences into exclusive zones.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"The original research did find only minor differences. The tongue map's exclusive zones were a misrepresentation of this data."}]},

The tongue map greatly exaggerated these minor variations.","distractors":[{"answer":"major","explanation":"The differences were minor, not major. All areas could detect all tastes with only slight sensitivity variations."},{"answer":"no","explanation":"There were minor differences, but they were small. The tongue map exaggerated them into exclusive zones."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about scientific literacy.","sentence":"The tongue map myth shows why it is important to check {{blank:1}} sources rather than accepting claims without evidence.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"primary","correctExplanation":"Checking primary sources (original research) would have revealed the tongue map was a misinterpretation. Secondary sources repeated the error.","distractors":[{"answer":"social media","explanation":"While checking social media claims is important, the key lesson is verifying information against primary research sources."},{"answer":"popular","explanation":"Popular sources can be unreliable. The lesson is to check primary (original research) sources for accuracy."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how the tongue map myth demonstrates the difference between scientific research and popular interpretation.","correct":"Valid research showing minor sensitivity variations was misinterpreted into a dramatic but incorrect diagram","correctExplanation":"The original research was legitimate but its nuanced findings were oversimplified and misrepresented for a general audience, creating a persistent myth.","distractors":[{"answer":"The original research was fraudulent and deliberately created the myth","explanation":"The original research was valid. The myth arose from misinterpretation, not fraud."},{"answer":"Popular interpretation is always more accurate than the original scientific research","explanation":"This case shows the opposite: the popular interpretation (tongue map) was less accurate than the original research."},{"answer":"Scientific research and popular interpretation always produce identical conclusions","explanation":"This myth demonstrates that popular interpretations can significantly distort original research findings."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why the tongue map is a useful case study for teaching critical thinking in science.","correct":"It shows how an easily testable claim persisted because people accepted authority rather than testing it themselves","correctExplanation":"Anyone can disprove the tongue map with salt and their own tongue, yet it persisted for decades because people trusted textbooks without testing.","distractors":[{"answer":"It has no value for teaching critical thinking because it is too simple","explanation":"Its simplicity makes it an excellent case study — a claim that anyone can test but few bothered to question."},{"answer":"It only teaches that all science is wrong and should not be trusted","explanation":"It teaches the importance of testing claims and checking sources, not that science is untrustworthy."},{"answer":"It demonstrates that critical thinking is unnecessary because textbooks are always correct","explanation":"The tongue map is specifically an example of a textbook error, showing why critical thinking is essential."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare the tongue map myth with another common food misconception. What pattern do they share?","correct":"Both involve oversimplification of complex science into memorable but inaccurate claims that are rarely questioned","correctExplanation":"Myths like the tongue map and 'searing seals in juices' share a pattern: complex science is reduced to simple, appealing claims that persist because they are easy to remember.","distractors":[{"answer":"Food myths share no common patterns and each arises from completely unique circumstances","explanation":"Many food myths share the pattern of oversimplifying complex science into memorable but incorrect statements."},{"answer":"All food misconceptions are deliberately created by companies to sell products","explanation":"Most food myths arise from misunderstanding or oversimplification of genuine science, not deliberate deception."},{"answer":"Food myths are always eventually corrected within one year of being created","explanation":"Many food myths persist for decades. The tongue map appeared in textbooks for over 100 years before being widely corrected."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse what would be different about sensory evaluation if the tongue map were actually correct.","correct":"Food placement on the tongue would matter, and evaluators would need to ensure food contacts specific areas for accurate testing","correctExplanation":"If taste zones existed, sensory evaluation protocols would need to control where food contacts the tongue to ensure consistent, accurate taste detection.","distractors":[{"answer":"Sensory evaluation would be impossible because food cannot be placed on specific tongue areas","explanation":"Food placement can be controlled. The point is that the tongue map's predictions are incorrect."},{"answer":"Nothing would be different because tongue anatomy has no connection to sensory testing","explanation":"If the tongue map were real, food placement would significantly affect taste perception and test design."},{"answer":"Evaluators would need to remove parts of their tongue for accurate testing","explanation":"No tissue removal would be needed. The hypothetical scenario would only require controlling food placement."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse the role of confirmation bias in maintaining the tongue map myth.","correct":"People may notice slight sensitivity differences and interpret them as confirming the tongue map, ignoring evidence that all areas detect all tastes","correctExplanation":"Minor sensitivity variations do exist, so people performing casual tests may notice slight differences that seem to confirm the map while overlooking the broader evidence.","distractors":[{"answer":"Confirmation bias played no role because everyone immediately accepted the tongue map was wrong","explanation":"Confirmation bias helped maintain the myth — people noticed supporting evidence while ignoring contradictory evidence."},{"answer":"Confirmation bias means the tongue map must actually be correct because people believe it","explanation":"Confirmation bias distorts perception. Widespread belief does not make a claim correct."},{"answer":"Confirmation bias only affects scientists, not students or the general public","explanation":"Confirmation bias affects everyone. Both students and scientists can be influenced by pre-existing beliefs."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse the educational impact of teaching the tongue map correction versus never mentioning the myth.","correct":"Teaching the correction develops critical thinking and shows how scientific understanding evolves through questioning","correctExplanation":"Using the tongue map as a corrected example teaches students that science self-corrects, that claims should be tested, and that even textbooks can contain errors.","distractors":[{"answer":"The tongue map should never be mentioned to avoid confusing students","explanation":"Teaching the correction is more valuable than silence because it develops critical thinking skills."},{"answer":"Students should be taught the tongue map without correction because it is easier to understand","explanation":"Teaching incorrect information for simplicity undermines scientific literacy and critical thinking."},{"answer":"Only university students should learn the correction; younger students cannot understand it","explanation":"The correction is simple enough for any student: place salt on your tongue tip and taste it."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how modern technology has helped definitively disprove the tongue map.","correct":"Molecular biology has identified specific taste receptor cells across the entire tongue, confirming all areas detect all tastes","correctExplanation":"Advanced microscopy and molecular techniques have mapped taste receptor distribution, showing receptors for all five tastes across the entire tongue surface.","distractors":[{"answer":"Modern technology has confirmed the tongue map is correct by finding distinct taste zones","explanation":"Modern research has consistently disproved the tongue map. All receptor types are found across the tongue."},{"answer":"Technology has shown that the tongue has no taste receptors at all","explanation":"Technology has confirmed taste receptors exist across the entire tongue, detecting all five tastes."},{"answer":"Modern technology cannot study taste receptors because they are too small to observe","explanation":"Modern molecular biology can identify and map individual taste receptor cells with high precision."}]},

People may interpret these as supporting the tongue map through confirmation bias.","distractors":[{"answer":"colour","explanation":"Tongue colour does not relate to taste zones. The minor variations are in sensitivity, not colour."},{"answer":"temperature","explanation":"Temperature differences are not related to the tongue map. The minor variations are in taste sensitivity."}]}}},

Similarly powerful visuals showing correct receptor distribution can help replace the myth.","distractors":[{"answer":"Visual media should be banned from science education because they always create myths","explanation":"Visuals are powerful educational tools. The issue is accuracy, not the medium itself."},{"answer":"Only text-based information should be used in science because diagrams are inherently misleading","explanation":"Diagrams are valuable when accurate. The lesson is about accuracy in visual communication, not avoiding visuals."},{"answer":"Visual media have no effect on how people learn or remember scientific information","explanation":"Research shows visuals significantly affect learning and memory, which is why the tongue map diagram was so persistent."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate what the tongue map myth teaches us about the relationship between authority and truth in science.","correct":"Authority (textbooks, teachers) can propagate errors, which is why evidence and testing should always take priority over authority","correctExplanation":"Science values evidence over authority. The tongue map shows that even respected sources can be wrong, reinforcing the importance of evidence-based thinking.","distractors":[{"answer":"It proves that no authority figure in science can ever be trusted","explanation":"Authority is valuable but not infallible. The lesson is to prioritise evidence, not to reject all authority."},{"answer":"It shows that textbooks are always more reliable than experimental evidence","explanation":"The tongue map shows the opposite: experimental evidence (tasting at different locations) is more reliable than an incorrect textbook diagram."},{"answer":"It demonstrates that once something is printed in a textbook, it becomes scientifically true","explanation":"Publication does not equal truth. The tongue map shows that printed claims must be verified against evidence."}]},
