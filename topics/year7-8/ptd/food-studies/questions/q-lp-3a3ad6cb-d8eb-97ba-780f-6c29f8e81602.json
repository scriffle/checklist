      "correct": "The gentle temperature keeps the whites tender without making them rubbery",
      "correctExplanation": "Poaching at 70-80°C gently coagulates egg proteins. Boiling at 100°C would cause rapid coagulation, making the whites tough and rubbery while breaking them apart.",
      "distractors": [

      "correct": "The vigorous bubbles keep pasta moving so it cooks evenly and doesn't stick",
      "correctExplanation": "A rolling boil at 100°C creates turbulence that keeps pasta pieces separated and moving freely, ensuring even cooking and preventing clumping.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because pasta can only absorb water at exactly 100°C and no lower temperature", "explanation": "Pasta can absorb water at lower temperatures, but the movement from boiling prevents sticking." },
        { "answer": "Because simmering water would dissolve the pasta completely into the liquid", "explanation": "Pasta doesn't dissolve at lower temperatures; it just cooks unevenly and sticks together." },

      "correct": "Gentle heat allows flavours to develop without breaking ingredients apart",
      "correctExplanation": "Simmering at 85-95°C allows gradual flavour extraction and melding. Vigorous boiling would break apart soft ingredients and can make the broth cloudy.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because simmering uses less water than boiling for the same recipe", "explanation": "Both use the same amount of water; the difference is temperature and agitation level." },

      "question": "What would happen if you vigorously boiled fish instead of poaching it?",
      "correct": "The fish would break apart and become dry from the turbulent water",
      "correctExplanation": "Fish has delicate proteins. Vigorous boiling creates turbulence that physically breaks the fish apart, and the high heat can over-coagulate proteins, making them dry.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The fish would cook faster but taste exactly the same as poached fish", "explanation": "Boiled fish would have very different texture (broken, dry) compared to gently poached fish." },

      "correct": "Gentle simmering slowly converts collagen to gelatin without drying out the meat",
      "correctExplanation": "Simmering at 85-95°C provides the sustained, gentle heat needed to break down collagen in tough cuts over hours. Boiling's higher temperature can cause proteins to seize up and dry out.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because simmering is faster than boiling for cooking tough meat cuts", "explanation": "Simmering is not faster; it works because of gentle, sustained heat over a longer time." },
        { "answer": "Because boiling water cannot reach the inside of large pieces of meat", "explanation": "Heat from both methods penetrates meat; the issue is the aggressiveness of the cooking, not heat penetration." },
        { "answer": "Because simmering adds a special flavour that boiling water does not have", "explanation": "The water itself doesn't change flavour; simmering improves texture by allowing gradual collagen breakdown." }

      "correct": "Simmering shows gentle bubbles; poaching shows only slight surface movement",
      "correctExplanation": "At simmering temperature (85-95°C), small bubbles are visible. At poaching temperature (70-80°C), the liquid barely moves with no visible bubbles.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Simmering liquid is clear while poaching liquid is always cloudy in colour", "explanation": "Clarity depends on what's in the liquid, not the temperature. The visual difference is bubble activity." },

      "distractors": [

      "correct": "The difference in turbulence and agitation matters more than the temperature itself",
      "correctExplanation": "The small temperature difference creates a massive difference in water movement. Boiling creates vigorous turbulence that physically damages food, while simmering is gentle. It's the physical agitation, not just heat, that matters.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because 15°C is a large temperature difference that changes food chemistry completely", "explanation": "15°C is relatively small in absolute terms; the key difference is the physical behaviour of the water, not chemical changes." },
        { "answer": "Because food cannot cook at all below 100°C and only cooks when water is boiling", "explanation": "Food cooks at temperatures well below 100°C; poaching at 70-80°C effectively cooks many foods." },

      "correct": "Yes, given enough time the chicken will equilibrate to the 75°C water temperature",
      "correctExplanation": "With sufficient poaching time, the chicken's internal temperature will gradually reach the 75°C water temperature. This takes longer than higher-temperature methods but achieves the safe internal temperature.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "No, because the cooking liquid must be hotter than the target internal temperature", "explanation": "While higher liquid temperature cooks faster, food will eventually reach the temperature of the surrounding liquid." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Vinegar raises the temperature of the water so it cooks the fish faster", "explanation": "Vinegar has negligible effect on water temperature; its effect is on protein coagulation." },
        { "answer": "Vinegar removes bacteria from the fish making it safe to eat at low temperature", "explanation": "While vinegar has some antimicrobial properties, its role in poaching is primarily about protein coagulation." },
