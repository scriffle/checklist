    {"type":"mc","question":"In a triangle test, how many samples does each taster receive?","correct":"Three","correctExplanation":"In a triangle test, tasters receive three samples: two are identical and one is different. They must identify the odd one out.","distractors":[{"answer":"Two","explanation":"Two samples would be a paired comparison test. A triangle test uses three samples."},{"answer":"Five","explanation":"Five samples would be excessive. A triangle test uses exactly three samples."},{"answer":"One","explanation":"One sample provides no comparison. A triangle test requires three samples for comparison."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is the purpose of a triangle test?","correct":"To determine if people can detect a difference between two products","correctExplanation":"Triangle tests are used to find out whether a noticeable difference exists between two products, such as when testing a recipe change.","distractors":[{"answer":"To determine which product tastes better","explanation":"Triangle tests detect difference, not preference. Preference tests are a separate type of sensory evaluation."},{"answer":"To measure the exact nutritional content of foods","explanation":"Triangle tests are sensory tests, not nutritional analyses. They detect perceptible differences."},{"answer":"To test how long food lasts before going off","explanation":"That would be a shelf-life test. Triangle tests detect whether people can tell two products apart."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How should samples be labelled in a triangle test?","correct":"With random 3-digit codes","correctExplanation":"Random 3-digit codes like 472, 815, and 293 prevent bias. Using names or letters like A, B, C could influence tasters' expectations.","distractors":[{"answer":"With the product names clearly written on each","explanation":"Product names would reveal which is different, introducing bias. Random codes prevent this."},{"answer":"With letters A, B, and C","explanation":"Letters can create bias (people may assume A is better). Random 3-digit codes are more neutral."},{"answer":"With colours like red, blue, and green","explanation":"Colours can create associations and bias. Random 3-digit codes are the standard unbiased labelling method."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What is the chance of correctly guessing the odd sample in a triangle test?","correct":"33% (one in three)","correctExplanation":"Since there are three samples and only one is different, the probability of guessing correctly by chance alone is 1 in 3, or approximately 33%.","distractors":[{"answer":"50% (one in two)","explanation":"50% would apply to a two-sample test. With three samples, the chance of guessing is 1 in 3 (33%)."},{"answer":"25% (one in four)","explanation":"25% would apply to four options. With three samples, the chance is 1 in 3 (33%)."},{"answer":"10% (one in ten)","explanation":"The chance is higher than 10%. With three samples, there is a 33% (1 in 3) chance of guessing correctly."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"In a triangle test, how many of the three samples are identical?","correct":"Two","correctExplanation":"Two samples are identical and one is different. The taster must identify which single sample is the odd one out.","distractors":[{"answer":"All three are different","explanation":"If all three were different, it would not be a triangle test. Two must be identical with one being different."},{"answer":"None — all three are identical","explanation":"If all three were identical, there would be nothing to detect. Two are identical and one is different."},{"answer":"One","explanation":"Two samples are identical and one is different. The taster identifies the one that differs from the other two."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"In a triangle test, tasters must identify which sample is different from the other two.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"The taster's task is to examine three samples (two identical, one different) and identify the odd one out.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Identifying the odd sample is exactly what triangle test tasters must do. Two samples are the same and one is different."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Using product names to label triangle test samples is good practice.","correct":"False","correctExplanation":"Product names create bias because tasters may have pre-existing preferences. Random 3-digit codes ensure unbiased evaluation.","distractors":[{"answer":"True","explanation":"Product names introduce bias. Random 3-digit codes are the correct labelling method for triangle tests."}]},

    {"type":"mc","question":"Why is a 33% guessing rate important when analysing triangle test results?","correct":"If significantly more than 33% of tasters identify the odd sample, there is likely a detectable difference","correctExplanation":"If only 33% succeed, they may be guessing. Significantly exceeding 33% provides statistical evidence that a real difference exists.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because exactly 33% of tasters should always get it right regardless of any difference","explanation":"33% is the guessing rate. If a genuine difference exists, more than 33% should correctly identify the odd sample."},{"answer":"Because 33% is the target success rate for a good product","explanation":"33% is the random guessing rate, not a quality target. Results significantly above 33% indicate a detectable difference."},{"answer":"The 33% rate has no relevance to interpreting triangle test results","explanation":"The 33% guessing rate is fundamental to interpreting results — it is the baseline against which actual results are compared."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How should a triangle test be set up to test whether consumers notice reduced salt in a recipe?","correct":"Serve three coded samples — two original recipe and one reduced salt (or vice versa) — to multiple tasters","correctExplanation":"The reduced salt version is the 'different' sample among three. Multiple tasters are needed for reliable results.","distractors":[{"answer":"Give one taster the original and reduced salt versions and ask which is better","explanation":"This is a preference test, not a triangle test. A triangle test uses three samples with two identical."},{"answer":"Tell tasters which sample has reduced salt and ask if they notice a difference","explanation":"Telling tasters which is different defeats the purpose. Triangle tests require blind identification of the odd sample."},{"answer":"Serve all three samples with reduced salt and see if anyone complains","explanation":"All three being the same provides no comparison. Two must be one version and one must be the other."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why must the presentation order of samples be randomised in a triangle test?","correct":"To prevent order bias — the position of the odd sample should not always be first, second, or third","correctExplanation":"If the different sample is always in the same position, tasters might develop a pattern. Randomising order ensures each position is equally likely.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because randomisation makes the test look more scientific but has no actual effect","explanation":"Randomisation has a genuine effect — it prevents position bias from influencing results."},{"answer":"Because tasters prefer receiving samples in random order","explanation":"Taster preference is not the reason. Randomisation prevents the odd sample's position from creating a detectable pattern."},{"answer":"Randomisation is not necessary because all samples taste the same anyway","explanation":"If samples tasted the same, there would be no need for the test. Randomisation prevents position bias from affecting results."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why do triangle tests require multiple tasters rather than just one or two?","correct":"Multiple tasters provide statistical reliability — individual variation means one person's result is not representative","correctExplanation":"Individual taste sensitivity varies. Testing multiple people ensures results reflect general detectability, not one person's unusual sensitivity or insensitivity.","distractors":[{"answer":"One taster is sufficient if they are an experienced food scientist","explanation":"Even experts have individual variation. Multiple tasters are needed for statistically reliable results."},{"answer":"Multiple tasters are used only to save time by testing everyone at once","explanation":"The reason is statistical reliability, not time efficiency. Individual results are too variable to be reliable alone."},{"answer":"More tasters are used to make the test more difficult","explanation":"More tasters improve statistical reliability, not difficulty. The test itself is the same for each individual."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What should tasters do between samples in a triangle test?","correct":"Cleanse their palate with water or a neutral cracker","correctExplanation":"Palate cleansing removes residual flavours from the previous sample, ensuring each sample is tasted without interference from the one before.","distractors":[{"answer":"Discuss their opinions with other tasters before trying the next sample","explanation":"Discussion introduces bias. Tasters should not communicate during the test. Palate cleansing is the correct between-sample procedure."},{"answer":"Nothing — samples should be tasted rapidly one after another","explanation":"Palate cleansing between samples prevents flavour carryover, which could affect detection of the odd sample."},{"answer":"Take notes about what they think the food is made of","explanation":"Identifying ingredients is not the purpose. Palate cleansing between samples prevents flavour interference."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why is a triangle test preferred over simply asking 'can you taste a difference?' between two samples?","correct":"The triangle test provides statistical rigour because the 33% guessing baseline allows mathematical analysis of results","correctExplanation":"A simple yes/no question has a 50% chance of being right by guessing. The triangle test's 33% baseline makes it harder to succeed by chance, providing more reliable evidence.","distractors":[{"answer":"There is no advantage — asking directly is equally reliable","explanation":"Direct questions have higher guessing rates (50%). Triangle tests provide more statistically reliable results with a 33% baseline."},{"answer":"Triangle tests are used because they are more traditional, not because they are better","explanation":"Triangle tests are used because they provide superior statistical evidence, not because of tradition."},{"answer":"A triangle test is identical to asking directly; only the name is different","explanation":"The methods are fundamentally different. Triangle tests use three samples and have a 33% guessing rate, providing better statistical evidence."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"Tasters should cleanse their palate between samples in a triangle test.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"Palate cleansing (usually with water or a neutral cracker) removes residual flavours and ensures each sample is tasted independently.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"Palate cleansing is an important step in triangle tests. It prevents flavour carryover between samples."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about triangle test analysis.","sentence":"If significantly more than {{blank:1}}% of tasters correctly identify the odd sample, there is likely a detectable difference between the products.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"33","correctExplanation":"33% is the random guessing rate for a triangle test. Results significantly above this suggest a real detectable difference.","distractors":[{"answer":"50","explanation":"50% is the guessing rate for a two-option test. The triangle test baseline is 33% (1 in 3)."},{"answer":"10","explanation":"10% is too low. The triangle test guessing rate is 33%, which is the baseline for comparison."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about palate cleansing.","sentence":"Tasters should cleanse their {{blank:1}} with water between samples to prevent flavour carryover from one sample to the next.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"palate","correctExplanation":"Palate cleansing removes residual flavours from the mouth, ensuring each sample is evaluated independently.","distractors":[{"answer":"hands","explanation":"Hand washing is important for hygiene but palate cleansing refers to clearing residual flavours from the mouth."},{"answer":"eyes","explanation":"Eyes are not involved in palate cleansing. The term refers to clearing the taste in the mouth between samples."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about sample presentation.","sentence":"The order in which samples are presented must be {{blank:1}} to prevent position bias in the triangle test.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"randomised","correctExplanation":"Randomising presentation order ensures the odd sample appears equally often in first, second, and third positions, preventing position bias.","distractors":[{"answer":"alphabetical","explanation":"Alphabetical order would create a pattern. Random order prevents position bias."},{"answer":"identical","explanation":"The order cannot be identical for everyone. Randomisation ensures position does not influence results."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how you would determine whether a triangle test result is statistically significant.","correct":"Compare the number of correct identifications to the expected number from guessing (33%) using statistical analysis","correctExplanation":"If 20 of 30 tasters identify the odd sample (67%) versus the expected 10 from guessing (33%), statistical tests determine if this difference is significant.","distractors":[{"answer":"If even one person identifies the odd sample, the result is significant","explanation":"One correct identification could easily be a lucky guess. Statistical significance requires results well above the 33% guessing rate."},{"answer":"Statistical significance cannot be determined from triangle test data","explanation":"Triangle test data is specifically designed for statistical analysis. The 33% baseline enables mathematical significance testing."},{"answer":"If fewer than 50% identify the odd sample, the test has failed","explanation":"The comparison is to 33% (guessing rate), not 50%. Results significantly above 33% indicate a detectable difference."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why the food industry uses triangle tests when reformulating products to reduce sugar or salt.","correct":"To determine if consumers can detect the change before committing to expensive large-scale production changes","correctExplanation":"If a triangle test shows consumers cannot detect reduced salt, the company can reformulate confidently. If they can detect it, further adjustment is needed.","distractors":[{"answer":"The food industry does not use triangle tests for reformulation decisions","explanation":"Triangle tests are commonly used in the food industry specifically for reformulation testing before market release."},{"answer":"Triangle tests are used only for marketing claims, not actual product development","explanation":"Triangle tests directly inform product development decisions, particularly regarding reformulation."},{"answer":"Companies skip testing and hope consumers will not notice recipe changes","explanation":"Responsible food companies use sensory testing like triangle tests to verify changes before release."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse what it means when triangle test results show no significant difference after reducing salt by 15%.","correct":"Consumers cannot reliably detect the 15% salt reduction, so the reformulation could proceed without affecting consumer acceptance","correctExplanation":"A non-significant result means the detection rate was not meaningfully above the 33% guessing rate, suggesting the change is imperceptible to most consumers.","distractors":[{"answer":"It means the triangle test was conducted incorrectly and should be redone","explanation":"Non-significant results are valid outcomes meaning the difference is not detectable, not that the test was flawed."},{"answer":"It means the salt reduction was too large and should be smaller","explanation":"If the change is undetectable, it means the reduction can proceed. A larger reduction might even be possible."},{"answer":"It means all tasters have poor taste ability","explanation":"Non-significant results indicate the products are perceptually similar, not that tasters are unable to taste."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare the triangle test with a preference test. When would you use each one?","correct":"Triangle tests detect if a difference exists; preference tests determine which option is liked more — use triangle first, then preference if needed","correctExplanation":"Triangle tests answer 'can people tell them apart?' Preference tests answer 'which do people prefer?' The order matters because preference is only relevant if a difference is detected.","distractors":[{"answer":"They are the same test with different names","explanation":"They serve different purposes. Triangle tests detect difference; preference tests determine liking."},{"answer":"Preference tests should always be used instead of triangle tests","explanation":"Triangle tests answer a different question. You need to know if a difference is detectable before asking about preference."},{"answer":"Triangle tests determine preference while preference tests detect difference","explanation":"This is reversed. Triangle tests detect difference; preference tests determine which is preferred."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse the limitations of a triangle test when evaluating complex flavour differences.","correct":"Triangle tests only detect if any difference exists, not what the specific differences are or how large they are","correctExplanation":"A triangle test tells you 'yes, people can detect a difference' but not 'the difference is in saltiness' or 'the difference is large.' Descriptive analysis is needed for detail.","distractors":[{"answer":"Triangle tests have no limitations and provide complete information about all differences","explanation":"Triangle tests only determine if a detectable difference exists. They cannot identify what the difference is."},{"answer":"Triangle tests cannot detect any differences in complex foods","explanation":"Triangle tests can detect differences in complex foods, but they cannot describe what those differences are."},{"answer":"The only limitation is that triangle tests take too long to conduct","explanation":"The main limitation is informational, not temporal. Triangle tests detect but do not describe differences."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how sample size (number of tasters) affects the reliability of triangle test conclusions.","correct":"Larger sample sizes increase statistical power, making it more likely to detect real differences and less likely to get false conclusions","correctExplanation":"With few tasters, random variation could mask a real difference or create a false positive. More tasters provide more reliable statistical evidence.","distractors":[{"answer":"Sample size has no effect on triangle test reliability","explanation":"Sample size directly affects statistical power. Larger samples provide more reliable conclusions."},{"answer":"Smaller sample sizes always give better results because individual tasters are more focused","explanation":"While individual focus matters, statistical reliability increases with more tasters regardless of focus."},{"answer":"Only one taster is needed if they are very experienced","explanation":"Even experienced tasters have individual variation. Multiple tasters are always needed for reliable results."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how you would design a series of triangle tests to find the maximum amount of salt reduction consumers cannot detect.","correct":"Conduct sequential triangle tests with increasing salt reductions until the test shows a significant detectable difference","correctExplanation":"Start with a small reduction (5%), test, and if undetectable, increase (10%, 15%, etc.) until the threshold of detection is found.","distractors":[{"answer":"One single triangle test with maximum salt reduction would be sufficient","explanation":"One test only tells you about that specific level. Sequential testing finds the threshold of detection."},{"answer":"It is impossible to find detection thresholds using triangle tests","explanation":"Sequential triangle tests at different reduction levels can systematically identify the detection threshold."},{"answer":"Simply reduce salt to zero and test once","explanation":"Reducing to zero would almost certainly be detected. Sequential testing finds the maximum undetectable reduction."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the analysis of triangle test applications.","sentence":"The food industry uses triangle tests during {{blank:1}} to determine if consumers can detect recipe changes before large-scale production.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"reformulation","correctExplanation":"Triangle tests are commonly used during product reformulation (changing ingredients) to verify that changes are acceptable to consumers.","distractors":[{"answer":"advertising","explanation":"Triangle tests are used in product development and reformulation, not advertising. They verify sensory changes."},{"answer":"packaging","explanation":"While packaging testing exists, triangle tests are used specifically for sensory evaluation of recipe changes."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the analysis of statistical significance.","sentence":"Triangle test results are significant when the correct identification rate is meaningfully above the {{blank:1}}% random guessing baseline.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"33","correctExplanation":"33% is the probability of correctly guessing in a triangle test. Results must significantly exceed this for evidence of a detectable difference.","distractors":[{"answer":"50","explanation":"50% is the guessing rate for a two-option test. The triangle test baseline is 33%."},{"answer":"0","explanation":"0% would mean no correct identifications. The baseline for comparison is the 33% guessing rate."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the analysis of test sequence.","sentence":"A {{blank:1}} test detects if a difference exists, while a preference test determines which product is liked more.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"triangle","correctExplanation":"Triangle tests detect difference. If a difference is found, preference testing can then determine which version consumers prefer.","distractors":[{"answer":"temperature","explanation":"Temperature tests measure heat, not sensory difference. Triangle tests are the sensory tool for detecting differences."},{"answer":"safety","explanation":"Safety tests evaluate food safety. Triangle tests detect perceptible differences between food products."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the triangle test's role in supporting public health initiatives to reduce sodium in processed foods.","correct":"Triangle tests provide evidence-based confidence that sodium reductions are imperceptible, enabling gradual reformulation without consumer rejection","correctExplanation":"By proving consumers cannot detect specific sodium reductions, triangle tests support stepwise reformulation strategies that improve public health without losing customers.","distractors":[{"answer":"Triangle tests are irrelevant to public health sodium reduction strategies","explanation":"Triangle tests are a key tool enabling the food industry to reduce sodium while maintaining consumer acceptance."},{"answer":"Public health initiatives should mandate sodium reduction without any sensory testing","explanation":"Without sensory testing, reformulation could lead to consumer rejection and product failure, undermining the health goals."},{"answer":"Triangle tests always show that consumers can detect any level of sodium reduction","explanation":"Many triangle tests show that moderate sodium reductions (10-25%) are undetectable, supporting reformulation."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the ethical considerations of using triangle tests to determine how much quality can be reduced before consumers notice.","correct":"While cost-reduction testing is legitimate, it raises concerns if used to systematically degrade product quality to the threshold of detection","correctExplanation":"Triangle tests can be used to maintain quality during reformulation or to find the minimum acceptable quality — the intent and transparency matter ethically.","distractors":[{"answer":"There are no ethical concerns because companies can make any product changes they want","explanation":"While companies have flexibility, deliberately degrading quality to the detection threshold raises legitimate ethical questions."},{"answer":"Triangle tests should be banned because they could be misused for quality reduction","explanation":"Triangle tests are valuable tools. The ethical concern is about intent, not the tool itself."},{"answer":"Companies never use triangle tests for cost reduction, only for product improvement","explanation":"Triangle tests can be used for both purposes. Ethical use depends on intent and consumer interest."}]},

A proper triangle test requires three coded samples (two identical, one different) per taster."},{"answer":"Serve muffins labelled 'full sugar' and 'reduced sugar' and ask which is better","explanation":"Labelling reveals the variable, introducing bias. Triangle tests use blind coding to prevent this."},{"answer":"Have one teacher taste both muffins and report whether there is a difference","explanation":"One taster cannot provide statistically reliable results. At least 30 tasters are recommended."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the limitations of triangle tests for complex multi-attribute differences and suggest complementary methods.","correct":"Triangle tests detect overall difference but not specific attributes — descriptive analysis panels can identify what specifically differs","correctExplanation":"Triangle tests answer 'is there a detectable difference?' Descriptive analysis with trained panels answers 'what specifically is different and by how much?'","distractors":[{"answer":"Triangle tests provide complete information and no complementary methods are ever needed","explanation":"Triangle tests only detect existence of difference. Descriptive analysis and other methods provide detailed attribute information."},{"answer":"Triangle tests and descriptive analysis provide identical information","explanation":"They provide different types of information. Triangle tests detect difference; descriptive analysis characterises it."},{"answer":"No complementary methods exist for sensory evaluation besides the triangle test","explanation":"Many sensory methods exist including descriptive analysis, preference ranking, and hedonic scales, each serving different purposes."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate how technology (electronic tongues, AI analysis) might supplement or replace human triangle testing in the future.","correct":"Technology could screen many formulations quickly, but human panels remain necessary for validating perceptual relevance","correctExplanation":"Electronic sensors can detect chemical differences rapidly, but only human testing confirms whether those differences are actually perceivable and relevant to consumers.","distractors":[{"answer":"Technology has already completely replaced human sensory testing","explanation":"Human panels remain essential because instruments cannot determine whether measured differences are perceptually significant."},{"answer":"Technology can never contribute to sensory testing in any way","explanation":"Technology can efficiently screen formulations and complement human testing, even though it cannot fully replace it."},{"answer":"Human tasters are less accurate than electronic instruments in all situations","explanation":"Instruments detect chemical differences, but human panels uniquely assess perceptual significance and consumer relevance."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse how cultural differences in taste sensitivity might affect international triangle test results.","correct":"Different populations may have varying sensitivity thresholds, meaning a change undetectable in one market might be noticed in another","correctExplanation":"Genetic and cultural differences affect taste sensitivity. A formulation change acceptable in one country might need adjustment for another market.","distractors":[{"answer":"Cultural differences have no effect on triangle test results because taste is universal","explanation":"While basic tastes are universal, sensitivity thresholds vary between populations due to genetic and dietary differences."},{"answer":"Triangle tests only work in Western countries and are invalid elsewhere","explanation":"Triangle tests work universally, but results may differ between populations due to sensitivity variations."},{"answer":"All humans have identical taste sensitivity so international results are always the same","explanation":"Genetic variation creates different sensitivity profiles between populations, affecting detectability thresholds."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the role of triangle tests in the growing plant-based food industry.","correct":"Triangle tests help determine if plant-based alternatives are perceptually similar enough to the animal products they aim to replace","correctExplanation":"Plant-based product developers use triangle tests to verify that their products are perceptually close to conventional equivalents, guiding reformulation.","distractors":[{"answer":"Plant-based products do not need sensory testing because they are automatically accepted","explanation":"Consumer acceptance depends on sensory similarity. Triangle tests are actively used in plant-based product development."},{"answer":"Triangle tests cannot be used with plant-based products","explanation":"Triangle tests work with any food product including plant-based alternatives."},{"answer":"The plant-based industry only uses taste tests, never triangle tests","explanation":"Triangle tests are widely used in plant-based product development to assess perceptual similarity to conventional products."}]},

Larger differences are more detectable; smaller ones fall below detection thresholds."},{"answer":"Human detection thresholds cannot be measured by any method","explanation":"Threshold mapping through sequential testing is a well-established psychophysical method."},{"answer":"Detection thresholds are identical for all people and all products","explanation":"Thresholds vary between individuals and between product attributes, which is why testing is necessary."}]},
