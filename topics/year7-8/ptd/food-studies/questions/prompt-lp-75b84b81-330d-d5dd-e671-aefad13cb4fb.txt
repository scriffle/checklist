TITLE: I can describe the scale of food waste in Australia and its environmental impact
CODE: 6.5

WHAT (concept explanation):
Australia wastes 7.6 million tonnes of food per year (312 kg per person). About 70% could have been eaten. Households are the biggest source at 32%. Food waste in landfill releases methane, which is 28 times more potent than CO2.

WHY (importance):
Understanding food waste helps you see why reducing it matters for both your budget and the environment.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
The average Australian household wastes $2,500-$3,800 worth of food per year. The most commonly wasted foods are vegetables (29%), fruit (22%), and bakery items (21%). Understanding date labels alone could significantly reduce this waste.

SUBTOPIC: Contemporary Food Issues
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores current issues in food systems including ultra-processed foods, food miles, environmental impact, food waste, convenience foods, and packaging. You will learn to evaluate food choices for both health and sustainability.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Food choices affect not just personal health but also the environment and society. Understanding contemporary food issues helps you make informed decisions that consider the broader impacts of what you eat.

TOPIC: Food Specialisations
SUBJECT: Food Studies | YEAR LEVEL: Year 8
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Analyse how characteristics and properties of food determine preparation techniques and presentation when creating solutions for healthy eating.

# Welcome to Food Specialisations!

Have you ever wondered why an egg goes from runny and clear to firm and white when you cook it? Or why your toast turns golden brown and smells amazing? Or how food companies decide what goes on those complicated labels?

In this unit, you'll discover the science hiding in your kitchen. You'll learn why foods behave the way they do when you cook them, how to read food labels like a pro, and how to make choices that are good for both your health and the planet.

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to:
- Explain how the properties of food (like proteins and starches) change during cooking
- Choose the right cooking method for different foods
- Read and interpret Australian food labels
- Evaluate foods using sensory evaluation techniques
- Make informed decisions about healthy and sustainable eating

Let's get started!

# Chapter 1: Healthy Eating the Australian Way

## What Are the Australian Dietary Guidelines?

The Australian Dietary Guidelines are the official advice on what Australians should eat to stay healthy. They were developed by nutrition scientists and are updated as new research emerges. The current guidelines were published in 2013.

Here are the five key guidelines:

**Guideline 1:** To achieve and maintain a healthy weight, be physically active and choose amounts of nutritious food and drinks to meet your energy needs.

**Guideline 2:** Enjoy a wide variety of nutritious foods from the five food groups every day.

**Guideline 3:** Limit intake of foods containing saturated fat, added salt, added sugars and alcohol.

**Guideline 4:** Encourage, support and promote breastfeeding.

**Guideline 5:** Care for your food; prepare and store it safely.

---

## The Five Food Groups

The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating organises foods into five groups. Each group provides different nutrients your body needs.

### 1. Vegetables and Legumes/Beans 🥦

This group includes all vegetables—leafy greens, root vegetables, salad vegetables, and legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and kidney beans.

**Why you need them:** Vegetables provide fibre, vitamins (especially A, C, and folate), and minerals. They're low in energy (kilojoules) but high in nutrients—we call this being "nutrient-dense."

**One serve looks like:**
- ½ cup cooked vegetables (like broccoli, carrots, or peas)
- 1 cup raw salad vegetables
- ½ medium potato
- 1 medium tomato
- ½ cup cooked legumes

### 2. Fruit 🍎

Fresh, frozen, canned (in juice, not syrup), and dried fruits all count.

**Why you need them:** Fruit provides natural sugars for energy, plus fibre, vitamin C, and other antioxidants.

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 medium apple, banana, or orange
- 2 small plums or kiwi fruits
- 1 cup diced fresh fruit
- 30g dried fruit (about 4 dried apricots)

**Important:** Fruit juice is NOT the same as whole fruit. When fruit is juiced, the fibre is removed, and the natural sugars become more concentrated. Stick to whole fruit most of the time.

### 3. Grain (Cereal) Foods 🍞

This includes bread, rice, pasta, noodles, oats, breakfast cereals, and flour-based foods.

**Why you need them:** Grains provide carbohydrates (your body's main energy source), fibre, and B vitamins.

**Choose wholegrain:** Wholegrain foods contain the entire grain—the outer bran layer (fibre), the germ (nutrients), and the endosperm (energy). White bread and white rice have had the bran and germ removed, so they have less fibre and fewer nutrients.

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 slice of bread (40g)
- ½ cup cooked rice, pasta, or noodles
- ⅔ cup wheat cereal flakes
- ¼ cup muesli

### 4. Lean Meats, Poultry, Fish, Eggs, Tofu, Nuts, Seeds, and Legumes 🥩

This group provides protein and includes animal and plant sources.

**Why you need them:** Protein is essential for building and repairing muscles, skin, hair, and other tissues. This group also provides iron, zinc, and B12.

**One serve looks like:**
- 65g cooked lean red meat (about the size of your palm)
- 80g cooked chicken
- 100g cooked fish
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup cooked legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans)
- 170g tofu
- 30g nuts or seeds

**Did you notice?** Legumes appear in TWO food groups! They count as both a vegetable AND a protein source because they provide nutrients from both groups.

### 5. Milk, Yoghurt, Cheese and Alternatives 🧀

This includes dairy products and calcium-fortified alternatives like soy milk.

**Why you need them:** These foods are our main source of calcium, which is essential for building strong bones and teeth—especially important while you're still growing!

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 cup (250ml) milk
- 2 slices (40g) hard cheese
- ¾ cup (200g) yoghurt
- 1 cup calcium-fortified soy milk

---

## How Much Do You Need?

The amount of food you need depends on your age, sex, and how active you are. Here's a guide for students your age:

| Food Group | Girls 12-13 | Boys 12-13 | Girls 14-18 | Boys 14-18 |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Vegetables | 5 serves | 5½ serves | 5 serves | 5½ serves |
| Fruit | 2 serves | 2 serves | 2 serves | 2 serves |
| Grains | 5 serves | 6 serves | 7 serves | 7 serves |
| Protein foods | 2½ serves | 2½ serves | 2½ serves | 2½ serves |
| Dairy | 3½ serves | 3½ serves | 3½ serves | 3½ serves |

You also need plenty of water—about **1.4 to 1.9 litres per day**, which is roughly 6-8 glasses.

---

## What About Treats? Understanding Discretionary Foods

Discretionary foods are sometimes called "sometimes foods" or "extras." They're not necessary for good health, but they can add enjoyment to eating.

**What makes a food "discretionary"?**
- High in saturated fat, added sugars, or salt
- High in energy (kilojoules) but low in nutrients
- Not part of the five food groups

**Examples include:**
- Soft drinks and energy drinks
- Chips and savoury snacks
- Chocolate, lollies, and biscuits
- Cakes, pastries, and doughnuts
- Pies, sausage rolls, and hot chips
- Ice cream
- Processed meats like salami

**How much is okay?** The guidelines suggest limiting discretionary foods to a maximum of about **600 kilojoules per day**—that's roughly:
- 2 scoops of ice cream, OR
- ⅓ of a meat pie, OR
- A few squares of chocolate, OR
- 1 small packet of chips (30g), OR
- 2-3 sweet biscuits

That's not much! This is why it's important to fill up on nutritious foods from the five food groups first.

---

## Nutrient Density: Getting More Bang for Your Buck

**Nutrient density** is a way of measuring how many beneficial nutrients a food provides compared to its energy (kilojoule) content.

**High nutrient-dense foods** give you lots of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and protein for relatively few kilojoules. Think vegetables, fruits, lean meats, legumes, and whole grains.

**Low nutrient-dense foods** (sometimes called "empty calories") give you lots of energy but few beneficial nutrients. Think soft drinks, chips, and lollies.

**Here's a comparison:**

Imagine you have 500 kilojoules to "spend." You could choose:
- **An apple** (about 350kJ): gives you fibre, vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants
- **A handful of pretzels** (about 350kJ): gives you... mostly just refined carbohydrates

Both have similar energy, but the apple is much more nutrient-dense. When you're choosing foods, think: "What nutrients am I getting for these kilojoules?"

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. How many serves of vegetables should a 13-year-old girl eat each day?
2. What's the difference between a "use-by" date and "best-before" date on food labels? (We'll cover this in detail later!)
3. Name a food that belongs to TWO different food groups.
4. Why is whole fruit better than fruit juice?
5. What does "nutrient-dense" mean?

# Chapter 2: The Science of Cooking

Have you ever wondered what's actually happening inside your food when you cook it? Cooking isn't just about making food taste better or making it safe to eat—it's chemistry in action! Understanding the science helps you become a better cook and make smarter food choices.

---

## How Heat Changes Proteins: Denaturation and Coagulation

Proteins are found in eggs, meat, fish, dairy, and legumes. They're made up of long chains of amino acids, folded into complex 3D shapes—kind of like a tangled ball of string.

When you apply heat to proteins, two important things happen:

### Denaturation

**Denaturation** is when the protein's folded structure unravels. Think of it like unfolding a paper crane back into a flat sheet—the shape changes permanently.

Heat isn't the only thing that causes denaturation. Acids (like lemon juice or vinegar), salt, and even mechanical action (like whisking) can also denature proteins.

### Coagulation

Once proteins are denatured, they can bond together in new ways. This is called **coagulation**—the proteins join up to form a solid or semi-solid mass.

---

## Eggs: The Perfect Example

Eggs are the best way to see protein changes in action because they're almost pure protein (plus fat in the yolk).

**Raw egg white** is clear and runny because the proteins are dissolved in water, floating around separately.

**When you heat an egg white**, the proteins denature and then coagulate—they bond together into a network that traps water. This is why cooked egg white is:
- Opaque (white) instead of clear
- Firm instead of runny
- Cannot return to its raw state (the change is permanent)

### Key Temperatures for Eggs

| Part of Egg | Coagulation Temperature |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Egg white | 62-65°C |
| Egg yolk | 65-70°C |

This is why you can cook a fried egg with a firm white but a runny yolk—the white sets at a lower temperature than the yolk!

**Try this at home:** Boil three eggs for different times—3 minutes, 6 minutes, and 10 minutes. Cut them in half and observe the differences. The 3-minute egg will have a runny yolk, the 6-minute egg will have a jammy yolk, and the 10-minute egg will be fully set.

---

## What Happens When You Cook Meat?

Meat contains several types of proteins, and they all respond differently to heat.

### Muscle Fibres

At around **60°C**, muscle proteins start to denature and coagulate. The meat becomes firmer and changes colour—this is why raw meat is red but cooked meat turns grey or brown.

The red colour in raw meat comes from a protein called **myoglobin**. When heated, myoglobin denatures and oxidises, changing from red → pink → grey/brown.

### Why Overcooked Meat Is Tough and Dry

When you cook meat at high temperatures or for too long, the protein fibres contract tightly. Imagine wringing out a wet sponge—that's what's happening to the moisture in your meat. The proteins squeeze out the water, leaving you with tough, dry meat.

**The lesson:** Don't overcook your steak!

### Collagen: Turning Tough Cuts Tender

Some cuts of meat have lots of **collagen**—a tough connective tissue that holds muscles together. These are usually cheaper cuts from hard-working parts of the animal, like:
- Beef brisket (chest)
- Lamb shanks (legs)
- Pork shoulder
- Beef cheeks

If you quickly grill these cuts, they'll be impossibly tough and chewy. But here's the magic: when collagen is heated slowly at temperatures between **70-82°C** for a long time (2-4 hours), it transforms into **gelatin**—a soft, silky substance that makes meat "fall off the bone" tender.

This is the science behind slow-cooked stews and braised dishes. Low and slow = tender and delicious!

---

## How Heat Changes Starches: Gelatinisation

Starches are found in foods like flour, rice, pasta, potatoes, and corn. Understanding how starches behave when heated is essential for making sauces, gravies, and baked goods.

### What Is Gelatinisation?

**Gelatinisation** is what happens when you heat starch in liquid. Here's the process:

1. **Starting point:** Starch exists as tiny granules—microscopic packets of starch molecules.

2. **Around 60°C:** The granules start absorbing water and swelling, like tiny sponges.

3. **Around 85°C:** The granules have absorbed about 5 times their weight in water and are fully swollen.

4. **Around 96°C:** The granules burst open, releasing starch molecules into the liquid. These molecules tangle together, thickening the liquid.

5. **On cooling:** The mixture sets into a gel.

### Making a White Sauce (Béchamel)

Making a white sauce is the perfect demonstration of gelatinisation. Here's what's happening:

1. You make a **roux** by cooking butter and flour together. This coats the starch granules in fat.

2. You gradually add milk while stirring constantly.

3. As you heat the sauce, the starch granules absorb the milk and swell.

4. When the sauce reaches near-boiling (about 96°C), the granules burst and release their starch, thickening the sauce.

**Why do we stir constantly?** Stirring serves two purposes:
- It distributes heat evenly so all the starch granules gelatinise at the same rate
- It prevents lumps by separating granules as they swell

**Why do we add liquid gradually?** Adding liquid slowly allows each addition to be fully incorporated before more is added. If you dump all the liquid in at once, the starch granules clump together and you get lumps!

---

## Why Does Bread Go Stale?

Here's something that might surprise you: **bread goes stale faster in the fridge than at room temperature!**

This seems wrong—doesn't refrigeration preserve food? Yes, but staling isn't about spoilage; it's about a process called **retrogradation**.

### What Is Retrogradation?

When bread is baked, the starches gelatinise—they absorb water and swell, giving bread its soft, moist texture.

But over time, those gelatinised starch molecules slowly reorganise and recrystallise. As they do, they push water out. This makes bread firm, dry, and stale.

**The surprising part:** This process happens fastest at refrigerator temperatures (around 4°C)! At room temperature, bread stales more slowly. In the freezer, the process essentially stops.

**Life hack:** If your bread has gone stale, try toasting it! Heat temporarily reverses retrogradation, which is why toast can make stale bread taste fresh again.

**Best bread storage:**
- Eat within a few days: room temperature in a bread bin
- Longer storage: freeze it, then toast slices as needed

---

## The Maillard Reaction: The Science of Delicious Browning

Have you ever noticed that toast, seared steak, roasted coffee, and baked cookies all have something in common? They're all brown, and they all smell amazing. That's the **Maillard reaction** at work!

### What Is the Maillard Reaction?

The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between **amino acids** (from proteins) and **reducing sugars** (like glucose) that occurs when food is heated to high temperatures.

The reaction creates:
- Brown colour
- Hundreds of new flavour compounds
- Appealing aromas

It was named after French chemist Louis-Camille Maillard, who first described it in 1912.

### Key Requirements

The Maillard reaction needs:
- **High temperatures:** Above 140-165°C
- **Dry conditions:** This is important!

Water boils at 100°C. As long as there's water present, the temperature can't get high enough for the Maillard reaction. This is why:
- Boiled potatoes are pale, but roasted potatoes are golden brown
- Steamed chicken is white, but grilled chicken has brown grill marks
- Wet bread won't toast properly

**Try this:** Put a piece of damp bread in the toaster. It won't brown properly until all the water evaporates. Then browning starts rapidly!

### Maillard Reaction vs Caramelisation

These are two different browning reactions that are often confused:

| Feature | Maillard Reaction | Caramelisation |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| What's needed | Amino acids + sugars + heat | Sugars + heat only |
| Temperature | ~140°C and above | ~160-180°C (higher) |
| Flavour result | Complex, savoury, meaty, nutty | Sweet, butterscotch, toffee |
| Examples | Toast, seared meat, roasted coffee | Caramel sauce, crème brûlée |

**Caramelisation** is the browning of sugars alone—no proteins needed. It requires higher temperatures and produces a different (sweeter) flavour profile.

---

## Common Cooking Myth: "Searing Seals in Juices"

You might have heard that you should sear meat at high heat to "seal in the juices." This is one of the most persistent myths in cooking, but it's completely false!

Scientists have tested this by weighing steaks before and after cooking. They found that seared steaks actually **lose MORE moisture** than steaks cooked at lower temperatures.

So why do we sear meat? For the **Maillard reaction**! Searing creates that delicious brown crust, complex flavours, and appealing aroma. It doesn't seal in anything—it just makes meat taste amazing.

---

## Emulsification: Mixing the Unmixable

Oil and water don't mix—everyone knows that. If you pour oil into water, the oil floats on top in a separate layer. But what about mayonnaise? It's made from oil and vinegar (which is mostly water), yet it's a smooth, creamy mixture. How does that work?

### What Is an Emulsion?

An **emulsion** is a mixture of two liquids that normally don't mix, where one liquid is dispersed as tiny droplets throughout the other.

**Types of emulsions:**
- **Oil-in-water (O/W):** Oil droplets dispersed in water. Examples: mayonnaise, milk, salad dressings
- **Water-in-oil (W/O):** Water droplets dispersed in oil. Examples: butter, margarine

### The Role of Emulsifiers

An **emulsifier** is a substance that helps hold emulsions together. Emulsifiers work because they have two different ends:
- A **hydrophilic** (water-loving) end that bonds with water
- A **hydrophobic** (water-fearing) end that bonds with oil

The emulsifier positions itself at the boundary between oil and water droplets, creating a protective coating around each droplet and preventing them from joining back together.

### Lecithin: Nature's Emulsifier

**Lecithin** is a natural emulsifier found in egg yolks (about 1.2% of the yolk). This is why egg yolks are used to make mayonnaise, hollandaise sauce, and other emulsified sauces.

### Making Mayonnaise: Emulsion in Action

Traditional mayonnaise contains:
- Oil (70-80%)
- Egg yolk (the emulsifier)
- Vinegar or lemon juice (acid)
- Salt and seasonings

**The technique is crucial:**
1. Start with egg yolk and whisk in a small amount of acid
2. Add oil **very slowly**—just drops at first—while whisking vigorously
3. The lecithin in the egg yolk coats each tiny oil droplet before more oil is added
4. Gradually you can add oil faster as the emulsion stabilises

**Why emulsions "split":**
- Adding oil too quickly (droplets don't get coated before more are added)
- Not enough emulsifier (egg yolk)
- Temperature extremes (too cold or too hot)
- Wrong proportions

If your mayonnaise splits (separates into oily and watery layers), you can often rescue it by starting with a fresh egg yolk and slowly whisking the broken mayonnaise into it.

---

## How Acids Affect Food

Acids—like lemon juice, vinegar, lime juice, and wine—are powerful ingredients in cooking. Here's what they do:

### Tenderising Meat with Marinades

Remember how heat denatures proteins? Acids do the same thing! When you marinate meat in an acidic liquid, the acid denatures the proteins on the surface, making the meat more tender.

**But be careful:** If you marinate meat for too long, the acid will denature proteins too much, making the meat mushy and unpleasant. For most meats, **30 minutes to 2 hours** is enough.

### Preventing Browning

When you cut an apple, the cut surface turns brown within minutes. This is called **enzymatic browning**, and here's what's happening:

1. Cutting damages the apple's cells
2. An enzyme called **polyphenol oxidase (PPO)** is released
3. PPO reacts with oxygen in the air
4. Brown pigments are produced

**How lemon juice prevents browning:**
- **The acid denatures the enzyme:** PPO works best at pH 5-7, but lemon juice has a pH of about 2. At this low pH, the enzyme can't function.
- **Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant:** The vitamin C in lemon juice reacts with oxygen before PPO can, using up the oxygen needed for browning.

**Practical application:** When preparing apple slices for a lunch box or fruit platter, toss them in a little lemon juice to keep them looking fresh!

### Acids in Baking

Have you noticed that many recipes call for buttermilk and baking soda together? Here's why:

Buttermilk contains **lactic acid**. Baking soda is a **base** (sodium bicarbonate). When acid and base combine, they react and produce **carbon dioxide gas**.

Those CO₂ bubbles get trapped in the batter and make it rise—creating fluffy pancakes, tender scones, and light cakes.

**Important:** This reaction happens immediately when the ingredients combine, which is why recipes tell you to mix wet and dry ingredients separately, then combine them just before baking. If you let the batter sit too long, the bubbles escape before baking!

2. Why can you cook a fried egg with a firm white but runny yolk?
3. What happens to collagen when meat is slow-cooked?
4. Why does bread stored in the fridge go stale faster than bread at room temperature?
5. What two things are required for the Maillard reaction to occur?
6. Why do we add oil slowly when making mayonnaise?
7. How does lemon juice prevent apple slices from browning?

# Chapter 3: Cooking Methods

Choosing the right cooking method is one of the most important decisions you'll make in the kitchen. The properties of your ingredients—how much fat they contain, how tough or tender they are, how delicate their texture is—should guide your choice.

---

## Wet (Moist Heat) Cooking Methods

These methods use water or other liquids as the cooking medium. They're generally gentler and can't produce browning (because water limits the temperature to 100°C).

### Boiling (100°C)

**What it looks like:** Large bubbles rapidly breaking the surface—a "rolling boil."

**Best for:** Pasta, rice, potatoes, hard vegetables, eggs

**Advantages:** Fast cooking, kills bacteria effectively

**Disadvantages:** Can break up delicate foods, causes nutrients to leach into the water (especially water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C)

**Tip:** Don't throw out the cooking water from vegetables—use it in soups, gravies, or sauces to recapture some of those nutrients!

### Simmering (85-96°C)

**What it looks like:** Gentle bubbles rising to the surface, but not a full rolling boil.

**Best for:** Soups, stews, stocks, rice, sauces, tough cuts of meat

**Advantages:** Gentler than boiling, tenderises tough cuts, develops flavours over time

**Why not boil meat?** Boiling meat at 100°C causes proteins to contract rapidly, squeezing out moisture and making meat tough. Simmering is gentler.

### Poaching (70-85°C)

**What it looks like:** Very gentle—barely any bubbles at all. The surface just shimmers.

**Best for:** Eggs, fish, chicken breast, delicate fruit (like pears)

**Advantages:** Extremely gentle cooking perfect for delicate foods, no added fat, maintains moisture

**Example:** Poached eggs cook perfectly at this low temperature—the white sets gently while the yolk stays runny.

### Steaming (100°C+)

**What it looks like:** Food sits on a rack or in a basket above boiling water, never touching the water itself.

**Best for:** Vegetables, fish, dumplings, dim sum

**Advantages:** 
- **Retains the most nutrients** of any cooking method (vitamins don't leach into water)
- No added fat
- Preserves bright colours
- Gentle cooking

**Why steaming retains more nutrients:** Water-soluble vitamins (like vitamin C and B vitamins) dissolve into cooking water when you boil vegetables. Since steamed food never touches water, these vitamins stay in the food.

### Braising (135-165°C, combination method)

**What it looks like:** Food is first seared at high heat, then slow-cooked partially covered in liquid in the oven.

**Best for:** Tough cuts of meat (brisket, shanks, osso buco), root vegetables

**How it works:**
1. **Sear** the meat first at high heat (Maillard reaction = flavour!)
2. Add aromatics (onions, garlic, herbs) and liquid (stock, wine, tomatoes)
3. Cover and cook slowly in the oven at 135-165°C for 2-4 hours
4. The long, slow cooking converts **collagen to gelatin**, making tough meat incredibly tender

**Examples:** Beef bourguignon, lamb shanks, osso buco, pulled pork

---

## Dry Heat Cooking Methods

These methods use hot air, hot fat, or direct heat—no water involved. Because there's no water to limit the temperature, these methods can reach the high temperatures needed for browning.

### Baking (150-200°C)

**What it looks like:** Enclosed oven, hot air circulates around the food.

**Best for:** Bread, cakes, pastries, casseroles, fish

**Advantages:** Even cooking, creates golden crusts, hands-off cooking

### Roasting (180-230°C)

**What it looks like:** Similar to baking but typically at higher temperatures.

**Best for:** Large cuts of meat, whole chickens, vegetables

**What's happening:** The high heat creates a caramelised, crispy exterior through Maillard reaction and caramelisation, while the inside cooks through more slowly.

**Tip for roasting vegetables:** Cut them into similar-sized pieces so they cook evenly, toss with oil, spread in a single layer (not crowded), and roast at high heat until caramelised.

### Grilling (Very High Direct Heat)

**What it looks like:** Heat comes from below (barbecue) or above (grill element), cooking by direct radiant heat.

**Best for:** Steaks, chops, burgers, sausages, vegetables, kebabs

**Advantages:** 
- Creates char marks and smoky flavour
- Fat drips away from the food
- Quick cooking
- No added fat needed

**Best for tender cuts:** Grilling is a fast, high-heat method. It works best for tender cuts that don't need long cooking—like sirloin steak, lamb cutlets, or chicken breast.

### Shallow Frying (160-180°C)

**What it looks like:** Oil covers about half the food; you need to turn the food to cook both sides.

**Best for:** Eggs, fish fillets, schnitzel, pancakes, hash browns

**The key:** Oil must be hot enough that food sizzles immediately when added. If the oil isn't hot enough, food absorbs more oil and becomes greasy.

### Deep Frying (160-190°C)

**What it looks like:** Food is completely submerged in hot oil.

**Best for:** Chips, battered fish, doughnuts, spring rolls, fried chicken

**What's happening:** The hot oil rapidly heats the surface of the food, creating a crispy crust through the Maillard reaction. The interior steams from the inside out.

**Safety warning:** Hot oil is extremely dangerous! Never leave a deep fryer unattended, never fill it more than half full, and never add wet food to hot oil (it will splatter violently).

## Matching Cooking Methods to Food Properties

Understanding **why** certain foods suit certain methods is the key to becoming a skilled cook.

### Tender vs Tough Cuts of Meat

| Cut Type | Examples | Properties | Best Methods |
|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Tender** | Fillet steak, sirloin, chicken breast, pork loin | Little connective tissue, naturally tender | Grilling, frying, quick roasting |
| **Tough** | Beef brisket, lamb shank, pork shoulder, chuck | Lots of connective tissue (collagen) | Braising, stewing, slow cooking |

**Why:** Tender cuts are already soft, so quick, high-heat cooking preserves their texture. Tough cuts need long, slow cooking to convert their collagen into gelatin.

**What happens if you get it wrong:**
- Grill a lamb shank → tough, chewy, inedible
- Braise a fillet steak → mushy, overcooked, flavourless

### Delicate Foods

Delicate foods—like fish fillets, eggs, and chicken breast—have properties that require gentle handling:
- **Fish** flakes apart easily and dries out quickly
- **Eggs** have proteins that set rapidly
- **Chicken breast** is low in fat, so it dries out easily

**Best methods for delicate foods:** Poaching, steaming, gentle baking, or quick pan-frying. Avoid high, dry heat that will dry them out.

### Why You Wouldn't...

- **Boil a steak:** It would turn grey (no Maillard browning), become tough (proteins contract rapidly), and lose flavour to the water.

- **Deep-fry custard:** It would fall apart completely and might even explode from the water content turning to steam!

- **Grill a delicate fish on a barbecue without foil:** It would stick to the grates, fall apart, and dry out before it's cooked through.

- **Roast leafy greens:** They would burn and become bitter within minutes.

---

## Nutrient Retention: Which Methods Are Best?

Different cooking methods affect nutrient content in different ways. This matters most for **water-soluble vitamins** (vitamin C and B vitamins) which are sensitive to heat and can dissolve into cooking water.

**Cooking methods ranked for nutrient retention (best to worst):**

1. **Steaming** ⭐ Best—no contact with water, short cooking time
2. **Microwaving**—quick cooking, minimal water needed
3. **Stir-frying**—short cooking time, no water
4. **Roasting/baking**—dry heat preserves fat-soluble vitamins
5. **Boiling** ⚠️ Worst—vitamins leach into water, longer cooking times

**Tips for preserving nutrients:**
- Cook vegetables for the shortest time possible
- Use the smallest amount of water necessary
- Cut vegetables into larger pieces (less surface area = less nutrient loss)
- Don't throw away cooking water—use it in soups or sauces

# Chapter 4: Reading Food Labels

Food labels are like a window into what you're really eating. Learning to read them helps you make informed choices about your food. In Australia, food labelling is regulated by **Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ)**, which sets strict rules about what must appear on food packages.

---

## What Must Appear on Australian Food Labels?

Most packaged foods in Australia must display:

1. **Food name/description**
2. **Ingredient list**
3. **Date marking** (use-by or best-before)
4. **Nutrition Information Panel (NIP)**
5. **Allergen declarations**
6. **Name and address** of the manufacturer or supplier
7. **Country of origin**
8. **Lot identification** (for tracing purposes)
9. **Directions for use/storage** (where needed for safety)
10. **Warning statements** (where required)
11. **Net weight or volume**

**What's exempt?** Some foods don't need full labelling, including:
- Foods made and sold on the same premises (like at a bakery or deli counter)
- Unpackaged foods
- Very small packages (under 100cm²)
- Some single-ingredient foods

---

## Understanding the Nutrition Information Panel (NIP)

The Nutrition Information Panel is your most valuable tool for comparing foods. Here's what you'll find:

### Mandatory Information

Every NIP must include:
- **Energy** (in kilojoules, kJ)
- **Protein** (in grams)
- **Fat, total** (in grams)
- **Saturated fat** (in grams)
- **Carbohydrate** (in grams)
- **Sugars** (in grams)
- **Sodium** (in milligrams)

### Per Serve vs Per 100g: Why Both Matter

You'll notice the NIP has two columns: "Per Serve" and "Per 100g" (or per 100ml for liquids).

**Per serve** tells you what you'll consume in one suggested serving. This is useful for tracking your actual intake.

**BUT BEWARE:** Manufacturers decide what a "serving" is, and they often use small serving sizes to make the numbers look better! A packet of chips might list a serving as 25g, but most people eat the whole 50g packet.

**Per 100g** is the standardised measure that allows you to **fairly compare** different products. It's the same amount across all products, so it's the best way to compare which muesli bar is lower in sugar or which bread is higher in fibre.

**Golden rule:** Always use the "per 100g" column when comparing products!

### What Do the Numbers Mean?

Here's a guide to interpreting nutrient levels:

| Nutrient | Low (good) | High (limit) |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Sugar** | ≤5g per 100g | >15g per 100g |
| **Sodium** | <120mg per 100g | >400mg per 100g |
| **Saturated fat** | ≤1.5g per 100g | Higher amounts |
| **Fibre** | ≥3g per 100g is a good source | — |

**Example comparison:**

| Breakfast Cereal | Sugar per 100g | Verdict |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Cereal A | 3.2g | Low sugar ✓ |
| Cereal B | 22g | High sugar ✗ |
| Cereal C | 12g | Medium |

---

## Decoding the Ingredient List

The ingredient list tells you exactly what's in the food, listed in **descending order by weight**. The first ingredient is what the product contains most of, and the last is what it contains least of.

**What to look for:**
- If sugar, fat, or salt appears in the first few ingredients, the product contains a lot of it
- Watch for sugar's many names: sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, agave, rice malt syrup—they're all added sugars!
- Numbers like (102) or (621) refer to food additives

**Example ingredient list:**
> Wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil, cocoa powder (5%), glucose syrup, salt, raising agents (500, 501), emulsifier (soy lecithin), flavour.

This product has sugar as the second ingredient and glucose syrup as the fifth—that's two types of sugar high on the list. The (5%) next to cocoa powder tells you exactly how much is in there.

---

## Understanding Allergen Declarations

Food allergies can be life-threatening, so Australian food law requires allergens to be clearly declared.

### The Mandatory Allergens (as of 2024)

These allergens MUST be declared in Australia:
- Peanuts
- Tree nuts (the specific type must be named, e.g., "almonds," "cashews")
- Milk
- Eggs
- Sesame seeds
- Fish (the type must be named)
- Crustaceans (the type must be named, e.g., "prawns")
- Molluscs (the type must be named, e.g., "oysters")
- Soy/soya
- Cereals containing gluten (wheat, barley, rye, oats)
- Lupin
- Sulphites (if 10mg/kg or more)

### How Allergens Are Displayed

Allergens must be:
1. Highlighted in **bold** within the ingredient list
2. Listed in a separate "**Contains:**" statement in the same area as the ingredients

**Example:**
> Ingredients: Wheat flour, **milk**, sugar, **egg**, vegetable oil, **almonds**, salt.
> 
> **Contains: Wheat (gluten), milk, egg, tree nuts (almonds).**

### "May Contain" Statements

You might see statements like "May contain traces of peanuts." These are **voluntary**—companies use them to warn that a product might have been accidentally contaminated during manufacturing (for example, if peanut products are made on the same equipment).

These statements aren't regulated by law, so different companies use them differently. People with allergies need to decide their own comfort level with "may contain" warnings.

---

## Date Marking: Use-By vs Best-Before

This is one of the most misunderstood parts of food labelling!

### Use-By Date

**"Use by [date]"**

This is about **FOOD SAFETY**. Foods with a use-by date may become unsafe after this date, even if they look and smell fine.

**Important rules:**
- It's **illegal** to sell food after its use-by date
- You should **not eat** food after the use-by date
- Used for foods that might become dangerous, like fresh meat, dairy, and ready-to-eat salads

### Best-Before Date

**"Best before [date]"**

This is about **FOOD QUALITY**. The food is still safe to eat after this date, but it might not be at its best—it could be stale, have less flavour, or changed texture.

**Important rules:**
- It **is legal** to sell food after its best-before date (as long as it's not damaged or deteriorated)
- You **can eat** food after the best-before date if it looks and smells okay
- Used for foods like canned goods, cereals, biscuits, and snack foods

### Special Cases

- **Bread:** Products with a shelf life under 7 days can use "baked on" or "baked for" instead
- **Long-life foods:** Products with a shelf life of 2 years or more (like some canned foods) don't need date marking

**Don't waste food unnecessarily!** Understanding this difference helps reduce food waste. That can of beans two months past its best-before date? Probably still perfectly good. That chicken one day past its use-by date? Not worth the risk.

---

## Health Star Rating System

The **Health Star Rating** is a voluntary front-of-pack label that rates a food's overall nutritional profile from ½ star to 5 stars. More stars = healthier choice.

### How It Works

The rating is calculated by looking at:
- **Risk-increasing nutrients:** Energy, saturated fat, total sugars, sodium (these subtract points)
- **Risk-decreasing nutrients:** Protein, fibre, fruit/vegetable/nut/legume content (these add points)

### How to Use Health Stars

✅ **Do:** Compare similar products (two yoghurts, two breakfast cereals, two pasta sauces)

❌ **Don't:** Compare across categories (chips to bread, biscuits to vegetables)

❌ **Don't:** Assume a higher rating means a food is "healthy"—compare to similar products only

### Limitations

- **It's voluntary:** Only about 35% of eligible products display Health Star Ratings. Companies might only show them on their higher-scoring products.
- **It doesn't consider processing:** A highly processed food could still score reasonably well
- **Fresh produce:** Fresh fruit and vegetables automatically get 5 stars—they don't need the label!

---

## Country of Origin Labelling

Australian food labels must tell you where the food comes from. Look for the kangaroo-in-a-triangle logo and the bar chart.

### Understanding the Claims

| Claim | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Grown in Australia** | All significant ingredients grown in Australia |
| **Product of Australia** | All ingredients AND virtually all processing done in Australia |
| **Made in Australia** | Product underwent its "last substantial transformation" in Australia (but ingredients may be imported) |
| **Packed in Australia** | Only packaged here; ingredients from elsewhere |

### The Bar Chart

The bar chart shows the percentage of Australian ingredients, filled in 10% increments.

For example:
- A full bar (100%) means all ingredients are Australian
- A half-filled bar (50%) means about half the ingredients are Australian
- An empty bar means minimal Australian ingredients

**Note:** Only products that are grown, produced, or made in Australia can use the kangaroo logo.

---

## Nutrition and Health Claims

You'll often see claims on food packaging like "low fat" or "high in fibre." These claims are regulated—they can only be used if the product meets specific criteria.

### Nutrition Content Claims

These describe the nutrient content:

| Claim | What It Must Mean |
|-------|-------------------|
| Low fat | ≤3g per 100g (solid foods) |
| Fat free | ≤0.15g per 100g |
| Reduced fat | ≥25% less fat than the regular version |
| Low sugar | ≤5g per 100g (solid foods) |
| No added sugar | No sugar added (but may contain natural sugars) |
| Low sodium/salt | ≤120mg sodium per 100g |
| Good source of fibre | ≥4g fibre per serve |

### Watch Out For...

**"Reduced fat" doesn't mean "low fat."** A product only needs to have 25% less fat than its regular version. If the original had 40g fat per 100g, the "reduced fat" version could still have 30g—that's still high!

**"No added sugar" doesn't mean "no sugar."** A product can be naturally high in sugar (like fruit juice) and still claim "no added sugar."

**"Light" or "Lite" can mean anything.** These terms might refer to colour, taste, or texture—not necessarily fewer kilojoules. Always check the NIP.

**"Natural" is not a regulated term.** Any product can claim to be "natural"—it doesn't guarantee anything about health or quality.

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. Why should you use "per 100g" rather than "per serve" when comparing products?
2. What's the difference between a use-by date and a best-before date?
3. A product is labelled "Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients." What does this tell you?
4. A breakfast cereal contains 12g of sugar per 100g. Is this low, medium, or high?
5. If peanut oil is used in a product, how must it be displayed on the label?

---

# Chapter 5: Sensory Evaluation

When food scientists develop new products or chefs perfect recipes, they don't just rely on their own opinions. They use systematic **sensory evaluation** methods to objectively assess food. Understanding these techniques will help you evaluate food more critically and communicate about food more effectively.

---

## The Five Basic Tastes

Humans can detect five basic taste sensations. Each one serves an evolutionary purpose—helping our ancestors identify nutritious foods and avoid dangerous ones.

### Sweet

**What causes it:** Sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose) and some artificial sweeteners

**Examples:** Honey, ripe fruit, chocolate, lollies, sweet potato

**Purpose:** Signals energy-rich foods (carbohydrates)

### Sour

**What causes it:** Acids, including citric acid, acetic acid (vinegar), and lactic acid (yoghurt)

**Examples:** Lemons, vinegar, sour cream, green apples, sourdough bread

**Purpose:** Helps detect unripe fruit or potentially spoiled food

### Salty

**What causes it:** Sodium chloride (table salt) and other mineral salts

**Examples:** Chips, soy sauce, cheese, cured meats, seaweed

**Purpose:** Indicates sodium, which is essential for body functions

### Bitter

**What causes it:** Many different compounds (there are about 35 different bitter taste receptors!)

**Examples:** Coffee, dark chocolate, Brussels sprouts, grapefruit pith, some leafy greens

**Purpose:** Originally served as a warning against toxic plants (many poisons taste bitter)

### Umami

**What causes it:** Glutamate (an amino acid) and certain nucleotides

**Examples:** Parmesan cheese, ripe tomatoes, mushrooms, soy sauce, Vegemite, miso, aged meats

**Discovered:** Japanese scientist Dr. Kikunae Ikeda identified umami in 1908. The name means "pleasant savoury taste" or "deliciousness" in Japanese.

**Purpose:** Indicates protein-rich foods

---

## The Tongue Map Myth

You may have seen diagrams showing different parts of the tongue tasting different things—sweet at the tip, bitter at the back, and so on. 

**This is completely wrong!**

The "tongue map" was based on a misinterpretation of research from the 1800s. Scientists have since proven that taste receptors for all five tastes are distributed across the **entire tongue**. You can taste sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami anywhere on your tongue.

**Try it yourself:** Put a little salt on the very tip of your tongue. You'll taste it immediately—proving that saltiness isn't restricted to the sides of your tongue!

---

## Taste Interactions

Tastes don't exist in isolation—they interact with each other in interesting ways:

- **Salt enhances sweetness** (this is why salted caramel works!)
- **Salt reduces bitterness** (try a tiny bit of salt on grapefruit)
- **Sweet and sour balance each other** (sweet and sour sauce, lemonade)
- **Umami can reduce the need for salt** (adding Parmesan to pasta means you need less salt)
- **Sweet masks bitterness** (sugar in coffee)

Understanding these interactions helps cooks balance flavours in dishes.

---

## Beyond Taste: The Multi-Sensory Experience

When we talk about how food "tastes," we're actually talking about much more than just our taste buds. Our perception of food involves all our senses working together.

### Smell (Olfaction)

Here's something surprising: **approximately 80% of what we perceive as "taste" actually comes from smell!**

Think about the last time you had a cold and couldn't smell anything. Food probably seemed bland and flavourless, right? That's because the complex flavours we enjoy come largely from volatile aroma compounds.

There are two ways smell contributes to eating:
- **Orthonasal:** Smelling through your nostrils before you eat (the aroma of fresh bread)
- **Retronasal:** Aromas travelling from your mouth to your nose while you eat (the full flavour experience)

### Sight

"We eat with our eyes first." Before we even taste food, we've already judged it based on how it looks.

Visual cues include:
- **Colour:** Bright, vibrant colours suggest freshness; brown or grey suggests staleness
- **Presentation:** Well-arranged food appears more appetising
- **Portion size:** Affects expectations

**Example:** Studies have shown that people rate orange juice as tasting more "orangey" when it's a deeper orange colour—even if the actual flavour is identical!

### Touch/Texture

Our mouth has very sensitive touch receptors. Texture contributes enormously to food enjoyment—think about the difference between a crispy chip and a soggy one!

Temperature is also detected through touch and dramatically affects our perception of food.

### Sound

The sounds food makes—crunch, crackle, sizzle—contribute to our perception of freshness and quality. A crisp apple that makes a satisfying crunch seems fresher than a soft one that doesn't.

---

## Texture: The Vocabulary

Being able to describe food texture precisely is an important skill. Here are some common texture descriptors:

| Term | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Crispy** | Light, thin, shatters easily with a high-pitched sound | Potato chips, crackers, fried chicken skin |
| **Crunchy** | Firm, requires force to bite through, makes a cracking sound | Raw carrot, apple, granola |
| **Chewy** | Requires prolonged chewing | Toffee, dried fruit, crusty bread |
| **Tender** | Easy to cut or bite through | Well-cooked steak, ripe pear |
| **Tough** | Difficult to bite or chew | Overcooked meat, stale bread |
| **Smooth** | No graininess or lumps | Custard, puréed soup |
| **Creamy** | Rich, smooth, coats the mouth | Ice cream, butter, mayonnaise |
| **Flaky** | Breaks into thin layers | Croissant, baked fish, puff pastry |
| **Crumbly** | Falls apart easily into small pieces | Shortbread, feta cheese |
| **Moist** | Contains noticeable moisture | Fresh cake, ripe watermelon |
| **Dry** | Lacks moisture | Crackers, overcooked chicken |
| **Juicy** | Releases liquid when bitten | Orange segments, medium-rare steak |

### Texture Contrast

Great dishes often include **texture contrast**—combining different textures makes eating more interesting and stimulating. Think about:
- Croutons (crunchy) in smooth soup
- Nuts (crunchy) in creamy ice cream
- Crispy bacon on creamy pasta
- Crunchy granola on smooth yoghurt

---

## Sensory Evaluation Methods

Food scientists use structured tests to evaluate food objectively. Here are some methods you might use in class:

### Triangle Test (Discrimination Test)

**Purpose:** To determine if people can detect a difference between two products.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive three samples—two identical, one different
2. Samples are labelled with random 3-digit codes (like 472, 815, 293)
3. Tasters must identify the "odd one out"

**The maths:** The chance of guessing correctly by accident is 1 in 3 (33%). If significantly more than 33% of tasters get it right, there's a real detectable difference.

**Example use:** A food company changes their recipe to use less salt. Before launching the new version, they run a triangle test to see if consumers can actually taste the difference.

### Ranking Test

**Purpose:** To order several samples by intensity of a characteristic.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive several samples (usually 3-6)
2. Each sample is coded with random numbers
3. Tasters arrange them in order (e.g., "sweetest to least sweet" or "crunchiest to softest")

**Example use:** Comparing five different apple varieties to rank them from sweetest to sourest.

### Hedonic Test (Preference Test)

**Purpose:** To measure how much people like a product.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive samples
2. They rate each sample on a 9-point scale:
   - 1 = Dislike extremely
   - 5 = Neither like nor dislike
   - 9 = Like extremely
3. Results are averaged to get an overall acceptance score

**Example use:** A café wants to know which of three new smoothie recipes customers prefer.

---

## Setting Up Fair Sensory Tests

For sensory tests to give reliable results, they must be conducted carefully. Here are the key principles:

### Eliminate Bias

- **Use blind testing:** Samples should be coded with random 3-digit numbers, not "Sample A" or "new recipe" vs "old recipe"
- **Randomise order:** Each taster should receive samples in a different random order
- **No talking:** Tasters shouldn't discuss samples during testing—they might influence each other

### Control Variables

- **Same temperature:** Serve all samples at the same temperature
- **Same quantity:** Give the same amount of each sample
- **Same containers:** Use identical serving vessels

### Cleanse the Palate

- **Between samples:** Provide plain water and/or plain crackers
- **Wait time:** Allow 30 seconds between samples
- **No strong flavours beforehand:** Tasters shouldn't have just eaten or drunk strongly flavoured items

### Record Results

- **Record immediately:** Tasters should write down their responses right after tasting each sample
- **Don't change answers:** Once recorded, answers shouldn't be changed

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. What are the five basic taste sensations?
2. What does "umami" mean, and what foods contain it?
3. Why is the "tongue map" a myth?
4. Approximately what percentage of flavour perception comes from smell?
5. What's the difference between a hedonic test and a triangle test?
6. Why do we use random 3-digit codes instead of names for samples in sensory tests?

# Chapter 6: Contemporary Food Issues

Food doesn't just affect our health—it affects the entire planet. In this chapter, we'll explore some of the big issues facing our food system today, with a focus on Australia.

---

## Ultra-Processed Foods: What Are They?

You've probably heard that you should eat less "processed food," but what does that actually mean? Scientists use a classification system called **NOVA** to categorise foods by how processed they are.

### The NOVA Classification

**Group 1: Unprocessed or Minimally Processed Foods**

These are foods in their natural state or with minimal changes (like cleaning, cutting, or freezing).

*Examples:* Fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, plain milk, raw meat, fish, nuts, plain rice

**Group 2: Processed Culinary Ingredients**

These are substances extracted from Group 1 foods, used for cooking.

*Examples:* Olive oil, butter, sugar, salt, honey, flour

**Group 3: Processed Foods**

These are made by combining Groups 1 and 2 using traditional methods like canning, bottling, or simple cooking.

*Examples:* Canned vegetables, cheese, bread, canned fish, salted nuts

**Group 4: Ultra-Processed Foods**

These are industrial formulations with many ingredients, including additives you wouldn't find in a home kitchen.

*Examples:* Soft drinks, chips, instant noodles, packaged snacks, chicken nuggets, mass-produced cakes, many breakfast cereals

### How to Spot Ultra-Processed Foods

Look at the ingredient list. Ultra-processed foods typically have:
- **Long ingredient lists** (often 5+ ingredients)
- **Ingredients you wouldn't use at home**, like:
  - High-fructose corn syrup
  - Hydrogenated oils
  - Protein isolates
  - Maltodextrin
- **Cosmetic additives** to improve appearance, texture, or flavour:
  - Colours (e.g., 102, 110)
  - Flavours
  - Emulsifiers
  - Thickeners

### Why Does It Matter?

Research links high consumption of ultra-processed foods to increased risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. These foods are designed to be hyper-palatable (extremely tasty and hard to stop eating) and convenient.

**Australian statistics:**
- About **42%** of the total energy in a typical Australian diet comes from ultra-processed foods
- **60%** of packaged foods in Australian supermarkets are classified as ultra-processed

---

## Food Miles and Environmental Impact

**Food miles** measure the distance food travels from where it's produced to where it's consumed. It seems logical that food travelling shorter distances would be better for the environment, but the reality is more complicated.

### The Case FOR Considering Food Miles

- Supports local farmers and local economies
- Food often arrives fresher
- Generally requires less packaging
- Reduces transport emissions

### But It's Not That Simple...

Here's where it gets interesting: **how food is produced often matters more than how far it travels.**

Consider these examples:

**Example 1: Tomatoes**
- Tomatoes grown in heated greenhouses in cold climates produce MORE emissions than tomatoes imported from warmer countries where they grow naturally outdoors—even accounting for transport.

**Example 2: Lamb**
- New Zealand lamb exported to the UK has about **four times LESS** carbon emissions than lamb raised in the UK. Why? New Zealand's climate allows grass-fed farming with minimal inputs.

**Example 3: The full picture**
- Scientists estimate that ending ALL international food transport would only reduce food-system emissions by about 9%
- The biggest impact comes from **what** we eat, not just **where** it comes from

### What Actually Reduces Environmental Impact?

1. **Eat less beef and lamb** (these have the highest environmental footprint)
2. **Eat more plant-based foods** (legumes, vegetables, fruits, grains)
3. **Reduce food waste** (wasted food means wasted resources)
4. **Eat locally AND seasonally** (local tomatoes in summer are a win; local greenhouse tomatoes in winter might not be)

---

## The Environmental Footprint of Different Foods

Not all foods have the same environmental impact. Here's a comparison of greenhouse gas emissions:

| Food | Approximate kg CO₂ per kg food |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Beef | 36-100 |
| Lamb | 24-39 |
| Cheese | 12-24 |
| Pork | 12 |
| Chicken | 10 |
| Eggs | 4.5 |
| Tofu | 3.2 |
| Legumes | Under 2 |
| Vegetables | Under 1 |

**Key takeaway:** Beef produces about **6 times more greenhouse gases** than chicken per 50g of protein, and **up to 100 times more** than plant-based proteins like legumes.

### Water Use

Food production also uses enormous amounts of water:

| Food | Litres of water per kg produced |
|------|--------------------------------|
| Beef | 15,415 |
| Chicken | 4,325 |
| Vegetables | 322 |

This is why environmental organisations encourage "eating lower on the food chain"—choosing more plants and less meat.

---

## Food Waste: Australia's $36 Billion Problem

Australians waste a staggering amount of food:

- **7.6 million tonnes** of food wasted per year in Australia
- **312 kg** per person per year (that's almost 1 kg per day!)
- About **70%** of this could have been eaten
- Cost to the economy: **$36.6 billion per year**
- Cost to the average household: **$2,500-$3,800 per year** (about $50/week!)

### Where Does Food Waste Happen?

Households are actually the **biggest** source of food waste, responsible for about **32%** of all food waste in Australia (2.5 million tonnes per year).

**Most commonly wasted foods:**
1. Vegetables (29%)
2. Fruit (22%)
3. Leftovers and prepared meals
4. Bakery items (21%)
5. Dairy products
6. Meat

### Why Does Food Waste Matter for the Environment?

When food ends up in landfill, it doesn't just disappear. As it breaks down, it releases **methane**—a greenhouse gas that is **28 times more potent** than carbon dioxide.

About **92%** of household food waste in Australia still goes directly to landfill.

### How to Reduce Food Waste

**At home:**
- **Plan meals** and make a shopping list
- **Understand date labels** (remember: best-before = quality, use-by = safety)
- **Store food properly** to extend its life
- **Use leftovers** creatively
- **First in, first out:** Use older items before newer ones
- **Compost** what you can't eat

**Food rescue organisations** also play an important role:
- **Foodbank** delivers 92+ million meals per year
- **OzHarvest** rescues 441,500 meals per month
- **SecondBite** rescued 25.2 million kg of food in 2023

---

## Convenience Foods: The Trade-Offs

**Convenience foods** are commercially prepared foods designed for easy consumption and minimal preparation. They're a big part of modern life—but they come with trade-offs.

### Types of Convenience Foods

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Ready-to-eat | Pre-made sandwiches, sushi, salads |
| Ready-to-heat | Frozen meals, canned soups, microwave rice |
| Ready-to-cook | Meal kits, marinated meats, stir-fry mixes |

### Advantages

- Save time and effort
- Consistent quality and taste
- Extended shelf life
- Built-in portion control
- No cooking skills required
- Wide variety available
- Can be safer (commercially controlled processes)

### Disadvantages

- Often higher in salt, sugar, and saturated fat
- More packaging (environmental impact)
- Generally less nutritious than home-prepared equivalents
- May contain more additives
- Usually more expensive per serve
- May be ultra-processed

### Making Better Convenience Choices

Not all convenience foods are created equal! Some healthier options include:
- **Frozen vegetables and fruits:** Nutrients are preserved by flash-freezing
- **Canned legumes:** Ready-to-use protein, just rinse to reduce sodium
- **Plain Greek yoghurt:** High protein, minimal processing
- **Canned fish:** Convenient protein source
- **Microwavable brown rice:** Quick whole grain option
- **Pre-cut vegetables:** Saves preparation time without compromising nutrition

---

## Food Packaging and the Environment

Food packaging serves important purposes—it protects food, extends shelf life, provides required information, and prevents contamination. But it also creates enormous environmental problems.

### Australian Packaging Statistics

- 86% of all packaging **CAN** be recycled
- But only 56% is actually recycled
- **Plastic packaging recycling rate: only 19-20%**—the worst performer
- 84% of plastic waste goes to landfill
- 130,000 tonnes of plastic enters Australia's oceans each year

### Australia's 2025 National Packaging Targets

1. 100% of packaging to be reusable, recyclable, or compostable
2. 70% of plastic packaging being recycled or composted
3. 50% average recycled content in packaging
4. Phase out problematic single-use plastics

### What Can You Do?

Remember the hierarchy: **Reduce → Reuse → Recycle**

- **Reduce:** Buy products with less packaging; choose concentrated products; avoid single-serve packages
- **Reuse:** Choose reusable containers, bags, and bottles
- **Recycle:** Learn what can be recycled in your area; rinse containers; keep recycling uncontaminated

---

## Eating Seasonally in Australia

Eating **seasonal** produce means choosing fruits and vegetables that are naturally in season in your region. Seasonal produce is typically fresher, tastier, more nutritious, and has a lower environmental footprint.

**Summer (December–February)**
- Fruits: mangoes, berries, stone fruits (peaches, nectarines, plums), watermelon, cherries
- Vegetables: tomatoes, corn, zucchini, capsicum, cucumber, beans

**Autumn (March–May)**
- Fruits: apples, pears, figs, grapes, quinces
- Vegetables: pumpkin, mushrooms, broccoli, eggplant, sweet potato

**Winter (June–August)**
- Fruits: citrus (oranges, mandarins, lemons, grapefruit), kiwifruit

# Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

## Food Properties and Cooking Methods Summary

| Food Property | Recommended Methods | Why |
|---------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Tender meat** (fillet, chicken breast) | Grilling, frying, quick roasting | Doesn't need long cooking; preserves tenderness |
| **Tough meat** (brisket, shanks) | Braising, stewing, slow cooking | Needs time to convert collagen to gelatin |
| **Delicate** (fish, eggs) | Poaching, steaming, gentle baking | Gentle methods prevent overcooking and drying |
| **High starch** (potatoes, rice) | Boiling, steaming | Water needed for gelatinisation |
| **For browning** (anything you want crispy!) | Dry heat: roasting, grilling, frying | High, dry heat needed for Maillard reaction |
| **Nutrient preservation** | Steaming, microwaving, stir-frying | Minimal water contact and short cooking time |

---

## Key Temperatures to Remember

| Temperature | What Happens |
|-------------|--------------|
| 5°C | Top of safe refrigeration temperature |
| 5-60°C | **Danger zone** (bacteria multiply rapidly) |
| 62-65°C | Egg white coagulates |
| 65-70°C | Egg yolk coagulates |
| 70-82°C | Collagen converts to gelatin |
| 85-96°C | Simmering temperature |
| ~96°C | Starch fully gelatinises |
| 100°C | Water boils |
| 140°C+ | Maillard reaction begins |
| 160-180°C | Caramelisation occurs |

---

## Reading Labels: Quick Reference

**Use the per 100g column to compare products!**

| Nutrient | Low (good) | High (limit) |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Sugar | ≤5g per 100g | >15g per 100g |
| Sodium | <120mg per 100g | >400mg per 100g |
| Saturated fat | ≤1.5g per 100g | Higher amounts |
| Fibre | ≥3g per 100g is a good source | — |

**Date marking:**
- **Use-by** = Safety (don't eat after this date)
- **Best-before** = Quality (still safe after, but might not be at its best)

---

## Making Sustainable Food Choices

1. **Eat more plants, less meat** (especially beef and lamb)
2. **Reduce food waste** (plan meals, understand date labels, use leftovers)
3. **Choose seasonal produce** when possible
4. **Be thoughtful about packaging** (reduce, reuse, recycle)
5. **Cook at home more often** (generally healthier and less wasteful than convenience foods)

## Final Review Questions

1. A recipe tells you to "sear the meat to seal in the juices." Is this scientifically accurate? Explain what searing actually does.

2. You're making a cheese sauce and it turns out lumpy. Using your knowledge of gelatinisation, explain what probably went wrong and how to prevent it next time.

3. Compare these two breakfast cereals using only the Nutrition Information Panel:
   - Cereal A: 1,580kJ, 8.2g protein, 3.5g fat, 1.2g saturated fat, 62g carbs, 24g sugars, 380mg sodium per 100g
   - Cereal B: 1,510kJ, 11g protein, 6.2g fat, 0.8g saturated fat, 56g carbs, 3.8g sugars, 12mg sodium per 100g
   
   Which would be the healthier choice? Justify your answer.

4. Your grandmother stores bread in the fridge "to keep it fresh." Using your knowledge of starch retrogradation, explain why this might not be the best approach and suggest a better storage method.

5. You're designing a meal that needs to be both nutritious and environmentally sustainable. What food choices would you make and why?

6. A food label says "Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients" and shows a bar chart that's about 40% filled. What does this tell you about the product?

QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.
DISTRACTORS: Explanation must address why students might believe the wrong answer.
BEST FOR: Simple factual claims, common misconceptions to directly confront.

TITLE: I can describe the scale of food waste in Australia and its environmental impact
CODE: 6.5

WHAT (concept explanation):
Australia wastes 7.6 million tonnes of food per year (312 kg per person). About 70% could have been eaten. Households are the biggest source at 32%. Food waste in landfill releases methane, which is 28 times more potent than CO2.

WHY (importance):
Understanding food waste helps you see why reducing it matters for both your budget and the environment.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
The average Australian household wastes $2,500-$3,800 worth of food per year. The most commonly wasted foods are vegetables (29%), fruit (22%), and bakery items (21%). Understanding date labels alone could significantly reduce this waste.

SUBTOPIC: Contemporary Food Issues
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores current issues in food systems including ultra-processed foods, food miles, environmental impact, food waste, convenience foods, and packaging. You will learn to evaluate food choices for both health and sustainability.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Food choices affect not just personal health but also the environment and society. Understanding contemporary food issues helps you make informed decisions that consider the broader impacts of what you eat.

TOPIC: Food Specialisations
SUBJECT: Food Studies | YEAR LEVEL: Year 8
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Analyse how characteristics and properties of food determine preparation techniques and presentation when creating solutions for healthy eating.

# Welcome to Food Specialisations!

Have you ever wondered why an egg goes from runny and clear to firm and white when you cook it? Or why your toast turns golden brown and smells amazing? Or how food companies decide what goes on those complicated labels?

In this unit, you'll discover the science hiding in your kitchen. You'll learn why foods behave the way they do when you cook them, how to read food labels like a pro, and how to make choices that are good for both your health and the planet.

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to:
- Explain how the properties of food (like proteins and starches) change during cooking
- Choose the right cooking method for different foods
- Read and interpret Australian food labels
- Evaluate foods using sensory evaluation techniques
- Make informed decisions about healthy and sustainable eating

Let's get started!

# Chapter 1: Healthy Eating the Australian Way

## What Are the Australian Dietary Guidelines?

The Australian Dietary Guidelines are the official advice on what Australians should eat to stay healthy. They were developed by nutrition scientists and are updated as new research emerges. The current guidelines were published in 2013.

Here are the five key guidelines:

**Guideline 1:** To achieve and maintain a healthy weight, be physically active and choose amounts of nutritious food and drinks to meet your energy needs.

**Guideline 2:** Enjoy a wide variety of nutritious foods from the five food groups every day.

**Guideline 3:** Limit intake of foods containing saturated fat, added salt, added sugars and alcohol.

**Guideline 4:** Encourage, support and promote breastfeeding.

**Guideline 5:** Care for your food; prepare and store it safely.

---

## The Five Food Groups

The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating organises foods into five groups. Each group provides different nutrients your body needs.

### 1. Vegetables and Legumes/Beans 🥦

This group includes all vegetables—leafy greens, root vegetables, salad vegetables, and legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and kidney beans.

**Why you need them:** Vegetables provide fibre, vitamins (especially A, C, and folate), and minerals. They're low in energy (kilojoules) but high in nutrients—we call this being "nutrient-dense."

**One serve looks like:**
- ½ cup cooked vegetables (like broccoli, carrots, or peas)
- 1 cup raw salad vegetables
- ½ medium potato
- 1 medium tomato
- ½ cup cooked legumes

### 2. Fruit 🍎

Fresh, frozen, canned (in juice, not syrup), and dried fruits all count.

**Why you need them:** Fruit provides natural sugars for energy, plus fibre, vitamin C, and other antioxidants.

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 medium apple, banana, or orange
- 2 small plums or kiwi fruits
- 1 cup diced fresh fruit
- 30g dried fruit (about 4 dried apricots)

**Important:** Fruit juice is NOT the same as whole fruit. When fruit is juiced, the fibre is removed, and the natural sugars become more concentrated. Stick to whole fruit most of the time.

### 3. Grain (Cereal) Foods 🍞

This includes bread, rice, pasta, noodles, oats, breakfast cereals, and flour-based foods.

**Why you need them:** Grains provide carbohydrates (your body's main energy source), fibre, and B vitamins.

**Choose wholegrain:** Wholegrain foods contain the entire grain—the outer bran layer (fibre), the germ (nutrients), and the endosperm (energy). White bread and white rice have had the bran and germ removed, so they have less fibre and fewer nutrients.

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 slice of bread (40g)
- ½ cup cooked rice, pasta, or noodles
- ⅔ cup wheat cereal flakes
- ¼ cup muesli

### 4. Lean Meats, Poultry, Fish, Eggs, Tofu, Nuts, Seeds, and Legumes 🥩

This group provides protein and includes animal and plant sources.

**Why you need them:** Protein is essential for building and repairing muscles, skin, hair, and other tissues. This group also provides iron, zinc, and B12.

**One serve looks like:**
- 65g cooked lean red meat (about the size of your palm)
- 80g cooked chicken
- 100g cooked fish
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup cooked legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans)
- 170g tofu
- 30g nuts or seeds

**Did you notice?** Legumes appear in TWO food groups! They count as both a vegetable AND a protein source because they provide nutrients from both groups.

### 5. Milk, Yoghurt, Cheese and Alternatives 🧀

This includes dairy products and calcium-fortified alternatives like soy milk.

**Why you need them:** These foods are our main source of calcium, which is essential for building strong bones and teeth—especially important while you're still growing!

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 cup (250ml) milk
- 2 slices (40g) hard cheese
- ¾ cup (200g) yoghurt
- 1 cup calcium-fortified soy milk

---

## How Much Do You Need?

The amount of food you need depends on your age, sex, and how active you are. Here's a guide for students your age:

| Food Group | Girls 12-13 | Boys 12-13 | Girls 14-18 | Boys 14-18 |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Vegetables | 5 serves | 5½ serves | 5 serves | 5½ serves |
| Fruit | 2 serves | 2 serves | 2 serves | 2 serves |
| Grains | 5 serves | 6 serves | 7 serves | 7 serves |
| Protein foods | 2½ serves | 2½ serves | 2½ serves | 2½ serves |
| Dairy | 3½ serves | 3½ serves | 3½ serves | 3½ serves |

You also need plenty of water—about **1.4 to 1.9 litres per day**, which is roughly 6-8 glasses.

---

## What About Treats? Understanding Discretionary Foods

Discretionary foods are sometimes called "sometimes foods" or "extras." They're not necessary for good health, but they can add enjoyment to eating.

**What makes a food "discretionary"?**
- High in saturated fat, added sugars, or salt
- High in energy (kilojoules) but low in nutrients
- Not part of the five food groups

**Examples include:**
- Soft drinks and energy drinks
- Chips and savoury snacks
- Chocolate, lollies, and biscuits
- Cakes, pastries, and doughnuts
- Pies, sausage rolls, and hot chips
- Ice cream
- Processed meats like salami

**How much is okay?** The guidelines suggest limiting discretionary foods to a maximum of about **600 kilojoules per day**—that's roughly:
- 2 scoops of ice cream, OR
- ⅓ of a meat pie, OR
- A few squares of chocolate, OR
- 1 small packet of chips (30g), OR
- 2-3 sweet biscuits

That's not much! This is why it's important to fill up on nutritious foods from the five food groups first.

---

## Nutrient Density: Getting More Bang for Your Buck

**Nutrient density** is a way of measuring how many beneficial nutrients a food provides compared to its energy (kilojoule) content.

**High nutrient-dense foods** give you lots of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and protein for relatively few kilojoules. Think vegetables, fruits, lean meats, legumes, and whole grains.

**Low nutrient-dense foods** (sometimes called "empty calories") give you lots of energy but few beneficial nutrients. Think soft drinks, chips, and lollies.

**Here's a comparison:**

Imagine you have 500 kilojoules to "spend." You could choose:
- **An apple** (about 350kJ): gives you fibre, vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants
- **A handful of pretzels** (about 350kJ): gives you... mostly just refined carbohydrates

Both have similar energy, but the apple is much more nutrient-dense. When you're choosing foods, think: "What nutrients am I getting for these kilojoules?"

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. How many serves of vegetables should a 13-year-old girl eat each day?
2. What's the difference between a "use-by" date and "best-before" date on food labels? (We'll cover this in detail later!)
3. Name a food that belongs to TWO different food groups.
4. Why is whole fruit better than fruit juice?
5. What does "nutrient-dense" mean?

# Chapter 2: The Science of Cooking

Have you ever wondered what's actually happening inside your food when you cook it? Cooking isn't just about making food taste better or making it safe to eat—it's chemistry in action! Understanding the science helps you become a better cook and make smarter food choices.

---

## How Heat Changes Proteins: Denaturation and Coagulation

Proteins are found in eggs, meat, fish, dairy, and legumes. They're made up of long chains of amino acids, folded into complex 3D shapes—kind of like a tangled ball of string.

When you apply heat to proteins, two important things happen:

### Denaturation

**Denaturation** is when the protein's folded structure unravels. Think of it like unfolding a paper crane back into a flat sheet—the shape changes permanently.

Heat isn't the only thing that causes denaturation. Acids (like lemon juice or vinegar), salt, and even mechanical action (like whisking) can also denature proteins.

### Coagulation

Once proteins are denatured, they can bond together in new ways. This is called **coagulation**—the proteins join up to form a solid or semi-solid mass.

---

## Eggs: The Perfect Example

Eggs are the best way to see protein changes in action because they're almost pure protein (plus fat in the yolk).

**Raw egg white** is clear and runny because the proteins are dissolved in water, floating around separately.

**When you heat an egg white**, the proteins denature and then coagulate—they bond together into a network that traps water. This is why cooked egg white is:
- Opaque (white) instead of clear
- Firm instead of runny
- Cannot return to its raw state (the change is permanent)

### Key Temperatures for Eggs

| Part of Egg | Coagulation Temperature |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Egg white | 62-65°C |
| Egg yolk | 65-70°C |

This is why you can cook a fried egg with a firm white but a runny yolk—the white sets at a lower temperature than the yolk!

**Try this at home:** Boil three eggs for different times—3 minutes, 6 minutes, and 10 minutes. Cut them in half and observe the differences. The 3-minute egg will have a runny yolk, the 6-minute egg will have a jammy yolk, and the 10-minute egg will be fully set.

---

## What Happens When You Cook Meat?

Meat contains several types of proteins, and they all respond differently to heat.

### Muscle Fibres

At around **60°C**, muscle proteins start to denature and coagulate. The meat becomes firmer and changes colour—this is why raw meat is red but cooked meat turns grey or brown.

The red colour in raw meat comes from a protein called **myoglobin**. When heated, myoglobin denatures and oxidises, changing from red → pink → grey/brown.

### Why Overcooked Meat Is Tough and Dry

When you cook meat at high temperatures or for too long, the protein fibres contract tightly. Imagine wringing out a wet sponge—that's what's happening to the moisture in your meat. The proteins squeeze out the water, leaving you with tough, dry meat.

**The lesson:** Don't overcook your steak!

### Collagen: Turning Tough Cuts Tender

Some cuts of meat have lots of **collagen**—a tough connective tissue that holds muscles together. These are usually cheaper cuts from hard-working parts of the animal, like:
- Beef brisket (chest)
- Lamb shanks (legs)
- Pork shoulder
- Beef cheeks

If you quickly grill these cuts, they'll be impossibly tough and chewy. But here's the magic: when collagen is heated slowly at temperatures between **70-82°C** for a long time (2-4 hours), it transforms into **gelatin**—a soft, silky substance that makes meat "fall off the bone" tender.

This is the science behind slow-cooked stews and braised dishes. Low and slow = tender and delicious!

---

## How Heat Changes Starches: Gelatinisation

Starches are found in foods like flour, rice, pasta, potatoes, and corn. Understanding how starches behave when heated is essential for making sauces, gravies, and baked goods.

### What Is Gelatinisation?

**Gelatinisation** is what happens when you heat starch in liquid. Here's the process:

1. **Starting point:** Starch exists as tiny granules—microscopic packets of starch molecules.

2. **Around 60°C:** The granules start absorbing water and swelling, like tiny sponges.

3. **Around 85°C:** The granules have absorbed about 5 times their weight in water and are fully swollen.

4. **Around 96°C:** The granules burst open, releasing starch molecules into the liquid. These molecules tangle together, thickening the liquid.

5. **On cooling:** The mixture sets into a gel.

### Making a White Sauce (Béchamel)

Making a white sauce is the perfect demonstration of gelatinisation. Here's what's happening:

1. You make a **roux** by cooking butter and flour together. This coats the starch granules in fat.

2. You gradually add milk while stirring constantly.

3. As you heat the sauce, the starch granules absorb the milk and swell.

4. When the sauce reaches near-boiling (about 96°C), the granules burst and release their starch, thickening the sauce.

**Why do we stir constantly?** Stirring serves two purposes:
- It distributes heat evenly so all the starch granules gelatinise at the same rate
- It prevents lumps by separating granules as they swell

**Why do we add liquid gradually?** Adding liquid slowly allows each addition to be fully incorporated before more is added. If you dump all the liquid in at once, the starch granules clump together and you get lumps!

---

## Why Does Bread Go Stale?

Here's something that might surprise you: **bread goes stale faster in the fridge than at room temperature!**

This seems wrong—doesn't refrigeration preserve food? Yes, but staling isn't about spoilage; it's about a process called **retrogradation**.

### What Is Retrogradation?

When bread is baked, the starches gelatinise—they absorb water and swell, giving bread its soft, moist texture.

But over time, those gelatinised starch molecules slowly reorganise and recrystallise. As they do, they push water out. This makes bread firm, dry, and stale.

**The surprising part:** This process happens fastest at refrigerator temperatures (around 4°C)! At room temperature, bread stales more slowly. In the freezer, the process essentially stops.

**Life hack:** If your bread has gone stale, try toasting it! Heat temporarily reverses retrogradation, which is why toast can make stale bread taste fresh again.

**Best bread storage:**
- Eat within a few days: room temperature in a bread bin
- Longer storage: freeze it, then toast slices as needed

---

## The Maillard Reaction: The Science of Delicious Browning

Have you ever noticed that toast, seared steak, roasted coffee, and baked cookies all have something in common? They're all brown, and they all smell amazing. That's the **Maillard reaction** at work!

### What Is the Maillard Reaction?

The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between **amino acids** (from proteins) and **reducing sugars** (like glucose) that occurs when food is heated to high temperatures.

The reaction creates:
- Brown colour
- Hundreds of new flavour compounds
- Appealing aromas

It was named after French chemist Louis-Camille Maillard, who first described it in 1912.

### Key Requirements

The Maillard reaction needs:
- **High temperatures:** Above 140-165°C
- **Dry conditions:** This is important!

Water boils at 100°C. As long as there's water present, the temperature can't get high enough for the Maillard reaction. This is why:
- Boiled potatoes are pale, but roasted potatoes are golden brown
- Steamed chicken is white, but grilled chicken has brown grill marks
- Wet bread won't toast properly

**Try this:** Put a piece of damp bread in the toaster. It won't brown properly until all the water evaporates. Then browning starts rapidly!

### Maillard Reaction vs Caramelisation

These are two different browning reactions that are often confused:

| Feature | Maillard Reaction | Caramelisation |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| What's needed | Amino acids + sugars + heat | Sugars + heat only |
| Temperature | ~140°C and above | ~160-180°C (higher) |
| Flavour result | Complex, savoury, meaty, nutty | Sweet, butterscotch, toffee |
| Examples | Toast, seared meat, roasted coffee | Caramel sauce, crème brûlée |

**Caramelisation** is the browning of sugars alone—no proteins needed. It requires higher temperatures and produces a different (sweeter) flavour profile.

## Common Cooking Myth: "Searing Seals in Juices"

You might have heard that you should sear meat at high heat to "seal in the juices." This is one of the most persistent myths in cooking, but it's completely false!

Scientists have tested this by weighing steaks before and after cooking. They found that seared steaks actually **lose MORE moisture** than steaks cooked at lower temperatures.

So why do we sear meat? For the **Maillard reaction**! Searing creates that delicious brown crust, complex flavours, and appealing aroma. It doesn't seal in anything—it just makes meat taste amazing.

---

## Emulsification: Mixing the Unmixable

Oil and water don't mix—everyone knows that. If you pour oil into water, the oil floats on top in a separate layer. But what about mayonnaise? It's made from oil and vinegar (which is mostly water), yet it's a smooth, creamy mixture. How does that work?

### What Is an Emulsion?

An **emulsion** is a mixture of two liquids that normally don't mix, where one liquid is dispersed as tiny droplets throughout the other.

**Types of emulsions:**
- **Oil-in-water (O/W):** Oil droplets dispersed in water. Examples: mayonnaise, milk, salad dressings
- **Water-in-oil (W/O):** Water droplets dispersed in oil. Examples: butter, margarine

### The Role of Emulsifiers

An **emulsifier** is a substance that helps hold emulsions together. Emulsifiers work because they have two different ends:
- A **hydrophilic** (water-loving) end that bonds with water
- A **hydrophobic** (water-fearing) end that bonds with oil

The emulsifier positions itself at the boundary between oil and water droplets, creating a protective coating around each droplet and preventing them from joining back together.

### Lecithin: Nature's Emulsifier

**Lecithin** is a natural emulsifier found in egg yolks (about 1.2% of the yolk). This is why egg yolks are used to make mayonnaise, hollandaise sauce, and other emulsified sauces.

### Making Mayonnaise: Emulsion in Action

Traditional mayonnaise contains:
- Oil (70-80%)
- Egg yolk (the emulsifier)
- Vinegar or lemon juice (acid)
- Salt and seasonings

**The technique is crucial:**
1. Start with egg yolk and whisk in a small amount of acid
2. Add oil **very slowly**—just drops at first—while whisking vigorously
3. The lecithin in the egg yolk coats each tiny oil droplet before more oil is added
4. Gradually you can add oil faster as the emulsion stabilises

**Why emulsions "split":**
- Adding oil too quickly (droplets don't get coated before more are added)
- Not enough emulsifier (egg yolk)
- Temperature extremes (too cold or too hot)
- Wrong proportions

If your mayonnaise splits (separates into oily and watery layers), you can often rescue it by starting with a fresh egg yolk and slowly whisking the broken mayonnaise into it.

---

## How Acids Affect Food

Acids—like lemon juice, vinegar, lime juice, and wine—are powerful ingredients in cooking. Here's what they do:

### Tenderising Meat with Marinades

Remember how heat denatures proteins? Acids do the same thing! When you marinate meat in an acidic liquid, the acid denatures the proteins on the surface, making the meat more tender.

**But be careful:** If you marinate meat for too long, the acid will denature proteins too much, making the meat mushy and unpleasant. For most meats, **30 minutes to 2 hours** is enough.

### Preventing Browning

When you cut an apple, the cut surface turns brown within minutes. This is called **enzymatic browning**, and here's what's happening:

1. Cutting damages the apple's cells
2. An enzyme called **polyphenol oxidase (PPO)** is released
3. PPO reacts with oxygen in the air
4. Brown pigments are produced

**How lemon juice prevents browning:**
- **The acid denatures the enzyme:** PPO works best at pH 5-7, but lemon juice has a pH of about 2. At this low pH, the enzyme can't function.
- **Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant:** The vitamin C in lemon juice reacts with oxygen before PPO can, using up the oxygen needed for browning.

**Practical application:** When preparing apple slices for a lunch box or fruit platter, toss them in a little lemon juice to keep them looking fresh!

### Acids in Baking

Have you noticed that many recipes call for buttermilk and baking soda together? Here's why:

Buttermilk contains **lactic acid**. Baking soda is a **base** (sodium bicarbonate). When acid and base combine, they react and produce **carbon dioxide gas**.

Those CO₂ bubbles get trapped in the batter and make it rise—creating fluffy pancakes, tender scones, and light cakes.

**Important:** This reaction happens immediately when the ingredients combine, which is why recipes tell you to mix wet and dry ingredients separately, then combine them just before baking. If you let the batter sit too long, the bubbles escape before baking!

# Chapter 3: Cooking Methods

Choosing the right cooking method is one of the most important decisions you'll make in the kitchen. The properties of your ingredients—how much fat they contain, how tough or tender they are, how delicate their texture is—should guide your choice.

---

## Wet (Moist Heat) Cooking Methods

These methods use water or other liquids as the cooking medium. They're generally gentler and can't produce browning (because water limits the temperature to 100°C).

### Boiling (100°C)

**What it looks like:** Large bubbles rapidly breaking the surface—a "rolling boil."

**Best for:** Pasta, rice, potatoes, hard vegetables, eggs

**Advantages:** Fast cooking, kills bacteria effectively

**Disadvantages:** Can break up delicate foods, causes nutrients to leach into the water (especially water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C)

**Tip:** Don't throw out the cooking water from vegetables—use it in soups, gravies, or sauces to recapture some of those nutrients!

### Simmering (85-96°C)

**What it looks like:** Gentle bubbles rising to the surface, but not a full rolling boil.

**Best for:** Soups, stews, stocks, rice, sauces, tough cuts of meat

**Advantages:** Gentler than boiling, tenderises tough cuts, develops flavours over time

**Why not boil meat?** Boiling meat at 100°C causes proteins to contract rapidly, squeezing out moisture and making meat tough. Simmering is gentler.

### Poaching (70-85°C)

**What it looks like:** Very gentle—barely any bubbles at all. The surface just shimmers.

**Best for:** Eggs, fish, chicken breast, delicate fruit (like pears)

**Advantages:** Extremely gentle cooking perfect for delicate foods, no added fat, maintains moisture

**Example:** Poached eggs cook perfectly at this low temperature—the white sets gently while the yolk stays runny.

### Steaming (100°C+)

**What it looks like:** Food sits on a rack or in a basket above boiling water, never touching the water itself.

**Best for:** Vegetables, fish, dumplings, dim sum

**Advantages:** 
- **Retains the most nutrients** of any cooking method (vitamins don't leach into water)
- No added fat
- Preserves bright colours
- Gentle cooking

**Why steaming retains more nutrients:** Water-soluble vitamins (like vitamin C and B vitamins) dissolve into cooking water when you boil vegetables. Since steamed food never touches water, these vitamins stay in the food.

### Braising (135-165°C, combination method)

**What it looks like:** Food is first seared at high heat, then slow-cooked partially covered in liquid in the oven.

**Best for:** Tough cuts of meat (brisket, shanks, osso buco), root vegetables

**How it works:**
1. **Sear** the meat first at high heat (Maillard reaction = flavour!)
2. Add aromatics (onions, garlic, herbs) and liquid (stock, wine, tomatoes)
3. Cover and cook slowly in the oven at 135-165°C for 2-4 hours
4. The long, slow cooking converts **collagen to gelatin**, making tough meat incredibly tender

**Examples:** Beef bourguignon, lamb shanks, osso buco, pulled pork

---

## Dry Heat Cooking Methods

These methods use hot air, hot fat, or direct heat—no water involved. Because there's no water to limit the temperature, these methods can reach the high temperatures needed for browning.

### Baking (150-200°C)

**What it looks like:** Enclosed oven, hot air circulates around the food.

**Best for:** Bread, cakes, pastries, casseroles, fish

**Advantages:** Even cooking, creates golden crusts, hands-off cooking

### Roasting (180-230°C)

**What it looks like:** Similar to baking but typically at higher temperatures.

**Best for:** Large cuts of meat, whole chickens, vegetables

**What's happening:** The high heat creates a caramelised, crispy exterior through Maillard reaction and caramelisation, while the inside cooks through more slowly.

**Tip for roasting vegetables:** Cut them into similar-sized pieces so they cook evenly, toss with oil, spread in a single layer (not crowded), and roast at high heat until caramelised.

### Grilling (Very High Direct Heat)

**What it looks like:** Heat comes from below (barbecue) or above (grill element), cooking by direct radiant heat.

**Best for:** Steaks, chops, burgers, sausages, vegetables, kebabs

**Advantages:** 
- Creates char marks and smoky flavour
- Fat drips away from the food
- Quick cooking
- No added fat needed

**Best for tender cuts:** Grilling is a fast, high-heat method. It works best for tender cuts that don't need long cooking—like sirloin steak, lamb cutlets, or chicken breast.

### Shallow Frying (160-180°C)

**What it looks like:** Oil covers about half the food; you need to turn the food to cook both sides.

**Best for:** Eggs, fish fillets, schnitzel, pancakes, hash browns

**The key:** Oil must be hot enough that food sizzles immediately when added. If the oil isn't hot enough, food absorbs more oil and becomes greasy.

### Deep Frying (160-190°C)

**What it looks like:** Food is completely submerged in hot oil.

**Best for:** Chips, battered fish, doughnuts, spring rolls, fried chicken

**What's happening:** The hot oil rapidly heats the surface of the food, creating a crispy crust through the Maillard reaction. The interior steams from the inside out.

**Safety warning:** Hot oil is extremely dangerous! Never leave a deep fryer unattended, never fill it more than half full, and never add wet food to hot oil (it will splatter violently).

## Matching Cooking Methods to Food Properties

Understanding **why** certain foods suit certain methods is the key to becoming a skilled cook.

### Tender vs Tough Cuts of Meat

| Cut Type | Examples | Properties | Best Methods |
|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Tender** | Fillet steak, sirloin, chicken breast, pork loin | Little connective tissue, naturally tender | Grilling, frying, quick roasting |
| **Tough** | Beef brisket, lamb shank, pork shoulder, chuck | Lots of connective tissue (collagen) | Braising, stewing, slow cooking |

**Why:** Tender cuts are already soft, so quick, high-heat cooking preserves their texture. Tough cuts need long, slow cooking to convert their collagen into gelatin.

**What happens if you get it wrong:**
- Grill a lamb shank → tough, chewy, inedible
- Braise a fillet steak → mushy, overcooked, flavourless

### Delicate Foods

Delicate foods—like fish fillets, eggs, and chicken breast—have properties that require gentle handling:
- **Fish** flakes apart easily and dries out quickly
- **Eggs** have proteins that set rapidly
- **Chicken breast** is low in fat, so it dries out easily

**Best methods for delicate foods:** Poaching, steaming, gentle baking, or quick pan-frying. Avoid high, dry heat that will dry them out.

### Why You Wouldn't...

- **Boil a steak:** It would turn grey (no Maillard browning), become tough (proteins contract rapidly), and lose flavour to the water.

- **Deep-fry custard:** It would fall apart completely and might even explode from the water content turning to steam!

- **Grill a delicate fish on a barbecue without foil:** It would stick to the grates, fall apart, and dry out before it's cooked through.

- **Roast leafy greens:** They would burn and become bitter within minutes.

---

## Nutrient Retention: Which Methods Are Best?

Different cooking methods affect nutrient content in different ways. This matters most for **water-soluble vitamins** (vitamin C and B vitamins) which are sensitive to heat and can dissolve into cooking water.

**Cooking methods ranked for nutrient retention (best to worst):**

1. **Steaming** ⭐ Best—no contact with water, short cooking time
2. **Microwaving**—quick cooking, minimal water needed
3. **Stir-frying**—short cooking time, no water
4. **Roasting/baking**—dry heat preserves fat-soluble vitamins
5. **Boiling** ⚠️ Worst—vitamins leach into water, longer cooking times

**Tips for preserving nutrients:**
- Cook vegetables for the shortest time possible
- Use the smallest amount of water necessary
- Cut vegetables into larger pieces (less surface area = less nutrient loss)
- Don't throw away cooking water—use it in soups or sauces

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

2. Why is steaming the best cooking method for preserving nutrients?
3. Which cooking method would you use for a tough beef brisket? Explain why.
4. Why can't wet cooking methods create browning on food?
5. What's the difference between baking and roasting?

# Chapter 4: Reading Food Labels

Food labels are like a window into what you're really eating. Learning to read them helps you make informed choices about your food. In Australia, food labelling is regulated by **Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ)**, which sets strict rules about what must appear on food packages.

---

## What Must Appear on Australian Food Labels?

Most packaged foods in Australia must display:

1. **Food name/description**
2. **Ingredient list**
3. **Date marking** (use-by or best-before)
4. **Nutrition Information Panel (NIP)**
5. **Allergen declarations**
6. **Name and address** of the manufacturer or supplier
7. **Country of origin**
8. **Lot identification** (for tracing purposes)
9. **Directions for use/storage** (where needed for safety)
10. **Warning statements** (where required)
11. **Net weight or volume**

**What's exempt?** Some foods don't need full labelling, including:
- Foods made and sold on the same premises (like at a bakery or deli counter)
- Unpackaged foods
- Very small packages (under 100cm²)
- Some single-ingredient foods

---

## Understanding the Nutrition Information Panel (NIP)

The Nutrition Information Panel is your most valuable tool for comparing foods. Here's what you'll find:

### Mandatory Information

Every NIP must include:
- **Energy** (in kilojoules, kJ)
- **Protein** (in grams)
- **Fat, total** (in grams)
- **Saturated fat** (in grams)
- **Carbohydrate** (in grams)
- **Sugars** (in grams)
- **Sodium** (in milligrams)

### Per Serve vs Per 100g: Why Both Matter

You'll notice the NIP has two columns: "Per Serve" and "Per 100g" (or per 100ml for liquids).

**Per serve** tells you what you'll consume in one suggested serving. This is useful for tracking your actual intake.

**BUT BEWARE:** Manufacturers decide what a "serving" is, and they often use small serving sizes to make the numbers look better! A packet of chips might list a serving as 25g, but most people eat the whole 50g packet.

**Per 100g** is the standardised measure that allows you to **fairly compare** different products. It's the same amount across all products, so it's the best way to compare which muesli bar is lower in sugar or which bread is higher in fibre.

**Golden rule:** Always use the "per 100g" column when comparing products!

### What Do the Numbers Mean?

Here's a guide to interpreting nutrient levels:

| Nutrient | Low (good) | High (limit) |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Sugar** | ≤5g per 100g | >15g per 100g |
| **Sodium** | <120mg per 100g | >400mg per 100g |
| **Saturated fat** | ≤1.5g per 100g | Higher amounts |
| **Fibre** | ≥3g per 100g is a good source | — |

**Example comparison:**

| Breakfast Cereal | Sugar per 100g | Verdict |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Cereal A | 3.2g | Low sugar ✓ |
| Cereal B | 22g | High sugar ✗ |
| Cereal C | 12g | Medium |

---

## Decoding the Ingredient List

The ingredient list tells you exactly what's in the food, listed in **descending order by weight**. The first ingredient is what the product contains most of, and the last is what it contains least of.

**What to look for:**
- If sugar, fat, or salt appears in the first few ingredients, the product contains a lot of it
- Watch for sugar's many names: sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, agave, rice malt syrup—they're all added sugars!
- Numbers like (102) or (621) refer to food additives

**Example ingredient list:**
> Wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil, cocoa powder (5%), glucose syrup, salt, raising agents (500, 501), emulsifier (soy lecithin), flavour.

This product has sugar as the second ingredient and glucose syrup as the fifth—that's two types of sugar high on the list. The (5%) next to cocoa powder tells you exactly how much is in there.

---

## Understanding Allergen Declarations

Food allergies can be life-threatening, so Australian food law requires allergens to be clearly declared.

### The Mandatory Allergens (as of 2024)

These allergens MUST be declared in Australia:
- Peanuts
- Tree nuts (the specific type must be named, e.g., "almonds," "cashews")
- Milk
- Eggs
- Sesame seeds
- Fish (the type must be named)
- Crustaceans (the type must be named, e.g., "prawns")
- Molluscs (the type must be named, e.g., "oysters")
- Soy/soya
- Cereals containing gluten (wheat, barley, rye, oats)
- Lupin
- Sulphites (if 10mg/kg or more)

### How Allergens Are Displayed

Allergens must be:
1. Highlighted in **bold** within the ingredient list
2. Listed in a separate "**Contains:**" statement in the same area as the ingredients

**Example:**
> Ingredients: Wheat flour, **milk**, sugar, **egg**, vegetable oil, **almonds**, salt.
> 
> **Contains: Wheat (gluten), milk, egg, tree nuts (almonds).**

### "May Contain" Statements

You might see statements like "May contain traces of peanuts." These are **voluntary**—companies use them to warn that a product might have been accidentally contaminated during manufacturing (for example, if peanut products are made on the same equipment).

These statements aren't regulated by law, so different companies use them differently. People with allergies need to decide their own comfort level with "may contain" warnings.

---

## Date Marking: Use-By vs Best-Before

This is one of the most misunderstood parts of food labelling!

### Use-By Date

**"Use by [date]"**

This is about **FOOD SAFETY**. Foods with a use-by date may become unsafe after this date, even if they look and smell fine.

**Important rules:**
- It's **illegal** to sell food after its use-by date
- You should **not eat** food after the use-by date
- Used for foods that might become dangerous, like fresh meat, dairy, and ready-to-eat salads

### Best-Before Date

**"Best before [date]"**

This is about **FOOD QUALITY**. The food is still safe to eat after this date, but it might not be at its best—it could be stale, have less flavour, or changed texture.

**Important rules:**
- It **is legal** to sell food after its best-before date (as long as it's not damaged or deteriorated)
- You **can eat** food after the best-before date if it looks and smells okay
- Used for foods like canned goods, cereals, biscuits, and snack foods

### Special Cases

- **Bread:** Products with a shelf life under 7 days can use "baked on" or "baked for" instead
- **Long-life foods:** Products with a shelf life of 2 years or more (like some canned foods) don't need date marking

**Don't waste food unnecessarily!** Understanding this difference helps reduce food waste. That can of beans two months past its best-before date? Probably still perfectly good. That chicken one day past its use-by date? Not worth the risk.

---

## Health Star Rating System

The **Health Star Rating** is a voluntary front-of-pack label that rates a food's overall nutritional profile from ½ star to 5 stars. More stars = healthier choice.

### How It Works

The rating is calculated by looking at:
- **Risk-increasing nutrients:** Energy, saturated fat, total sugars, sodium (these subtract points)
- **Risk-decreasing nutrients:** Protein, fibre, fruit/vegetable/nut/legume content (these add points)

### How to Use Health Stars

✅ **Do:** Compare similar products (two yoghurts, two breakfast cereals, two pasta sauces)

❌ **Don't:** Compare across categories (chips to bread, biscuits to vegetables)

❌ **Don't:** Assume a higher rating means a food is "healthy"—compare to similar products only

### Limitations

- **It's voluntary:** Only about 35% of eligible products display Health Star Ratings. Companies might only show them on their higher-scoring products.
- **It doesn't consider processing:** A highly processed food could still score reasonably well
- **Fresh produce:** Fresh fruit and vegetables automatically get 5 stars—they don't need the label!

---

## Country of Origin Labelling

Australian food labels must tell you where the food comes from. Look for the kangaroo-in-a-triangle logo and the bar chart.

### Understanding the Claims

| Claim | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Grown in Australia** | All significant ingredients grown in Australia |
| **Product of Australia** | All ingredients AND virtually all processing done in Australia |
| **Made in Australia** | Product underwent its "last substantial transformation" in Australia (but ingredients may be imported) |
| **Packed in Australia** | Only packaged here; ingredients from elsewhere |

### The Bar Chart

The bar chart shows the percentage of Australian ingredients, filled in 10% increments.

For example:
- A full bar (100%) means all ingredients are Australian
- A half-filled bar (50%) means about half the ingredients are Australian
- An empty bar means minimal Australian ingredients

**Note:** Only products that are grown, produced, or made in Australia can use the kangaroo logo.

---

## Nutrition and Health Claims

You'll often see claims on food packaging like "low fat" or "high in fibre." These claims are regulated—they can only be used if the product meets specific criteria.

### Nutrition Content Claims

These describe the nutrient content:

| Claim | What It Must Mean |
|-------|-------------------|
| Low fat | ≤3g per 100g (solid foods) |
| Fat free | ≤0.15g per 100g |
| Reduced fat | ≥25% less fat than the regular version |
| Low sugar | ≤5g per 100g (solid foods) |
| No added sugar | No sugar added (but may contain natural sugars) |
| Low sodium/salt | ≤120mg sodium per 100g |
| Good source of fibre | ≥4g fibre per serve |

### Watch Out For...

**"Reduced fat" doesn't mean "low fat."** A product only needs to have 25% less fat than its regular version. If the original had 40g fat per 100g, the "reduced fat" version could still have 30g—that's still high!

**"No added sugar" doesn't mean "no sugar."** A product can be naturally high in sugar (like fruit juice) and still claim "no added sugar."

**"Light" or "Lite" can mean anything.** These terms might refer to colour, taste, or texture—not necessarily fewer kilojoules. Always check the NIP.

**"Natural" is not a regulated term.** Any product can claim to be "natural"—it doesn't guarantee anything about health or quality.

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. Why should you use "per 100g" rather than "per serve" when comparing products?
2. What's the difference between a use-by date and a best-before date?
3. A product is labelled "Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients." What does this tell you?
4. A breakfast cereal contains 12g of sugar per 100g. Is this low, medium, or high?
5. If peanut oil is used in a product, how must it be displayed on the label?

---

# Chapter 5: Sensory Evaluation

When food scientists develop new products or chefs perfect recipes, they don't just rely on their own opinions. They use systematic **sensory evaluation** methods to objectively assess food. Understanding these techniques will help you evaluate food more critically and communicate about food more effectively.

---

## The Five Basic Tastes

Humans can detect five basic taste sensations. Each one serves an evolutionary purpose—helping our ancestors identify nutritious foods and avoid dangerous ones.

### Sweet

**What causes it:** Sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose) and some artificial sweeteners

**Examples:** Honey, ripe fruit, chocolate, lollies, sweet potato

**Purpose:** Signals energy-rich foods (carbohydrates)

### Sour

**What causes it:** Acids, including citric acid, acetic acid (vinegar), and lactic acid (yoghurt)

**Examples:** Lemons, vinegar, sour cream, green apples, sourdough bread

**Purpose:** Helps detect unripe fruit or potentially spoiled food

### Salty

**What causes it:** Sodium chloride (table salt) and other mineral salts

**Examples:** Chips, soy sauce, cheese, cured meats, seaweed

**Purpose:** Indicates sodium, which is essential for body functions

### Bitter

**What causes it:** Many different compounds (there are about 35 different bitter taste receptors!)

**Examples:** Coffee, dark chocolate, Brussels sprouts, grapefruit pith, some leafy greens

**Purpose:** Originally served as a warning against toxic plants (many poisons taste bitter)

### Umami

**What causes it:** Glutamate (an amino acid) and certain nucleotides

**Examples:** Parmesan cheese, ripe tomatoes, mushrooms, soy sauce, Vegemite, miso, aged meats

**Discovered:** Japanese scientist Dr. Kikunae Ikeda identified umami in 1908. The name means "pleasant savoury taste" or "deliciousness" in Japanese.

**Purpose:** Indicates protein-rich foods

---

## The Tongue Map Myth

You may have seen diagrams showing different parts of the tongue tasting different things—sweet at the tip, bitter at the back, and so on. 

**This is completely wrong!**

The "tongue map" was based on a misinterpretation of research from the 1800s. Scientists have since proven that taste receptors for all five tastes are distributed across the **entire tongue**. You can taste sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami anywhere on your tongue.

**Try it yourself:** Put a little salt on the very tip of your tongue. You'll taste it immediately—proving that saltiness isn't restricted to the sides of your tongue!

---

## Taste Interactions

Tastes don't exist in isolation—they interact with each other in interesting ways:

- **Salt enhances sweetness** (this is why salted caramel works!)
- **Salt reduces bitterness** (try a tiny bit of salt on grapefruit)
- **Sweet and sour balance each other** (sweet and sour sauce, lemonade)
- **Umami can reduce the need for salt** (adding Parmesan to pasta means you need less salt)
- **Sweet masks bitterness** (sugar in coffee)

Understanding these interactions helps cooks balance flavours in dishes.

---

## Beyond Taste: The Multi-Sensory Experience

When we talk about how food "tastes," we're actually talking about much more than just our taste buds. Our perception of food involves all our senses working together.

### Smell (Olfaction)

Here's something surprising: **approximately 80% of what we perceive as "taste" actually comes from smell!**

Think about the last time you had a cold and couldn't smell anything. Food probably seemed bland and flavourless, right? That's because the complex flavours we enjoy come largely from volatile aroma compounds.

There are two ways smell contributes to eating:
- **Orthonasal:** Smelling through your nostrils before you eat (the aroma of fresh bread)
- **Retronasal:** Aromas travelling from your mouth to your nose while you eat (the full flavour experience)

### Sight

"We eat with our eyes first." Before we even taste food, we've already judged it based on how it looks.

Visual cues include:
- **Colour:** Bright, vibrant colours suggest freshness; brown or grey suggests staleness
- **Presentation:** Well-arranged food appears more appetising
- **Portion size:** Affects expectations

**Example:** Studies have shown that people rate orange juice as tasting more "orangey" when it's a deeper orange colour—even if the actual flavour is identical!

### Touch/Texture

Our mouth has very sensitive touch receptors. Texture contributes enormously to food enjoyment—think about the difference between a crispy chip and a soggy one!

Temperature is also detected through touch and dramatically affects our perception of food.

### Sound

The sounds food makes—crunch, crackle, sizzle—contribute to our perception of freshness and quality. A crisp apple that makes a satisfying crunch seems fresher than a soft one that doesn't.

---

## Texture: The Vocabulary

Being able to describe food texture precisely is an important skill. Here are some common texture descriptors:

| Term | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Crispy** | Light, thin, shatters easily with a high-pitched sound | Potato chips, crackers, fried chicken skin |
| **Crunchy** | Firm, requires force to bite through, makes a cracking sound | Raw carrot, apple, granola |
| **Chewy** | Requires prolonged chewing | Toffee, dried fruit, crusty bread |
| **Tender** | Easy to cut or bite through | Well-cooked steak, ripe pear |
| **Tough** | Difficult to bite or chew | Overcooked meat, stale bread |
| **Smooth** | No graininess or lumps | Custard, puréed soup |
| **Creamy** | Rich, smooth, coats the mouth | Ice cream, butter, mayonnaise |
| **Flaky** | Breaks into thin layers | Croissant, baked fish, puff pastry |
| **Crumbly** | Falls apart easily into small pieces | Shortbread, feta cheese |
| **Moist** | Contains noticeable moisture | Fresh cake, ripe watermelon |
| **Dry** | Lacks moisture | Crackers, overcooked chicken |
| **Juicy** | Releases liquid when bitten | Orange segments, medium-rare steak |

### Texture Contrast

Great dishes often include **texture contrast**—combining different textures makes eating more interesting and stimulating. Think about:
- Croutons (crunchy) in smooth soup
- Nuts (crunchy) in creamy ice cream
- Crispy bacon on creamy pasta
- Crunchy granola on smooth yoghurt

## Sensory Evaluation Methods

Food scientists use structured tests to evaluate food objectively. Here are some methods you might use in class:

### Triangle Test (Discrimination Test)

**Purpose:** To determine if people can detect a difference between two products.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive three samples—two identical, one different
2. Samples are labelled with random 3-digit codes (like 472, 815, 293)
3. Tasters must identify the "odd one out"

**The maths:** The chance of guessing correctly by accident is 1 in 3 (33%). If significantly more than 33% of tasters get it right, there's a real detectable difference.

**Example use:** A food company changes their recipe to use less salt. Before launching the new version, they run a triangle test to see if consumers can actually taste the difference.

### Ranking Test

**Purpose:** To order several samples by intensity of a characteristic.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive several samples (usually 3-6)
2. Each sample is coded with random numbers
3. Tasters arrange them in order (e.g., "sweetest to least sweet" or "crunchiest to softest")

**Example use:** Comparing five different apple varieties to rank them from sweetest to sourest.

### Hedonic Test (Preference Test)

**Purpose:** To measure how much people like a product.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive samples
2. They rate each sample on a 9-point scale:
   - 1 = Dislike extremely
   - 5 = Neither like nor dislike
   - 9 = Like extremely
3. Results are averaged to get an overall acceptance score

**Example use:** A café wants to know which of three new smoothie recipes customers prefer.

---

## Setting Up Fair Sensory Tests

For sensory tests to give reliable results, they must be conducted carefully. Here are the key principles:

### Eliminate Bias

- **Use blind testing:** Samples should be coded with random 3-digit numbers, not "Sample A" or "new recipe" vs "old recipe"
- **Randomise order:** Each taster should receive samples in a different random order
- **No talking:** Tasters shouldn't discuss samples during testing—they might influence each other

### Control Variables

- **Same temperature:** Serve all samples at the same temperature
- **Same quantity:** Give the same amount of each sample
- **Same containers:** Use identical serving vessels

### Cleanse the Palate

- **Between samples:** Provide plain water and/or plain crackers
- **Wait time:** Allow 30 seconds between samples
- **No strong flavours beforehand:** Tasters shouldn't have just eaten or drunk strongly flavoured items

### Record Results

- **Record immediately:** Tasters should write down their responses right after tasting each sample
- **Don't change answers:** Once recorded, answers shouldn't be changed

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. What are the five basic taste sensations?
2. What does "umami" mean, and what foods contain it?
3. Why is the "tongue map" a myth?
4. Approximately what percentage of flavour perception comes from smell?
5. What's the difference between a hedonic test and a triangle test?
6. Why do we use random 3-digit codes instead of names for samples in sensory tests?

# Chapter 6: Contemporary Food Issues

Food doesn't just affect our health—it affects the entire planet. In this chapter, we'll explore some of the big issues facing our food system today, with a focus on Australia.

## Ultra-Processed Foods: What Are They?

You've probably heard that you should eat less "processed food," but what does that actually mean? Scientists use a classification system called **NOVA** to categorise foods by how processed they are.

### The NOVA Classification

**Group 1: Unprocessed or Minimally Processed Foods**

These are foods in their natural state or with minimal changes (like cleaning, cutting, or freezing).

*Examples:* Fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, plain milk, raw meat, fish, nuts, plain rice

**Group 2: Processed Culinary Ingredients**

These are substances extracted from Group 1 foods, used for cooking.

*Examples:* Olive oil, butter, sugar, salt, honey, flour

**Group 3: Processed Foods**

These are made by combining Groups 1 and 2 using traditional methods like canning, bottling, or simple cooking.

*Examples:* Canned vegetables, cheese, bread, canned fish, salted nuts

**Group 4: Ultra-Processed Foods**

These are industrial formulations with many ingredients, including additives you wouldn't find in a home kitchen.

*Examples:* Soft drinks, chips, instant noodles, packaged snacks, chicken nuggets, mass-produced cakes, many breakfast cereals

### How to Spot Ultra-Processed Foods

Look at the ingredient list. Ultra-processed foods typically have:
- **Long ingredient lists** (often 5+ ingredients)
- **Ingredients you wouldn't use at home**, like:
  - High-fructose corn syrup
  - Hydrogenated oils
  - Protein isolates
  - Maltodextrin
- **Cosmetic additives** to improve appearance, texture, or flavour:
  - Colours (e.g., 102, 110)
  - Flavours
  - Emulsifiers
  - Thickeners

### Why Does It Matter?

Research links high consumption of ultra-processed foods to increased risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. These foods are designed to be hyper-palatable (extremely tasty and hard to stop eating) and convenient.

**Australian statistics:**
- About **42%** of the total energy in a typical Australian diet comes from ultra-processed foods
- **60%** of packaged foods in Australian supermarkets are classified as ultra-processed

---

## Food Miles and Environmental Impact

**Food miles** measure the distance food travels from where it's produced to where it's consumed. It seems logical that food travelling shorter distances would be better for the environment, but the reality is more complicated.

### The Case FOR Considering Food Miles

- Supports local farmers and local economies
- Food often arrives fresher
- Generally requires less packaging
- Reduces transport emissions

### But It's Not That Simple...

Here's where it gets interesting: **how food is produced often matters more than how far it travels.**

Consider these examples:

**Example 1: Tomatoes**
- Tomatoes grown in heated greenhouses in cold climates produce MORE emissions than tomatoes imported from warmer countries where they grow naturally outdoors—even accounting for transport.

**Example 2: Lamb**
- New Zealand lamb exported to the UK has about **four times LESS** carbon emissions than lamb raised in the UK. Why? New Zealand's climate allows grass-fed farming with minimal inputs.

**Example 3: The full picture**
- Scientists estimate that ending ALL international food transport would only reduce food-system emissions by about 9%
- The biggest impact comes from **what** we eat, not just **where** it comes from

### What Actually Reduces Environmental Impact?

1. **Eat less beef and lamb** (these have the highest environmental footprint)
2. **Eat more plant-based foods** (legumes, vegetables, fruits, grains)
3. **Reduce food waste** (wasted food means wasted resources)
4. **Eat locally AND seasonally** (local tomatoes in summer are a win; local greenhouse tomatoes in winter might not be)

---

## The Environmental Footprint of Different Foods

Not all foods have the same environmental impact. Here's a comparison of greenhouse gas emissions:

| Food | Approximate kg CO₂ per kg food |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Beef | 36-100 |
| Lamb | 24-39 |
| Cheese | 12-24 |
| Pork | 12 |
| Chicken | 10 |
| Eggs | 4.5 |
| Tofu | 3.2 |
| Legumes | Under 2 |
| Vegetables | Under 1 |

**Key takeaway:** Beef produces about **6 times more greenhouse gases** than chicken per 50g of protein, and **up to 100 times more** than plant-based proteins like legumes.

### Water Use

Food production also uses enormous amounts of water:

| Food | Litres of water per kg produced |
|------|--------------------------------|
| Beef | 15,415 |
| Chicken | 4,325 |
| Vegetables | 322 |

This is why environmental organisations encourage "eating lower on the food chain"—choosing more plants and less meat.

---

## Food Waste: Australia's $36 Billion Problem

Australians waste a staggering amount of food:

- **7.6 million tonnes** of food wasted per year in Australia
- **312 kg** per person per year (that's almost 1 kg per day!)
- About **70%** of this could have been eaten
- Cost to the economy: **$36.6 billion per year**
- Cost to the average household: **$2,500-$3,800 per year** (about $50/week!)

### Where Does Food Waste Happen?

Households are actually the **biggest** source of food waste, responsible for about **32%** of all food waste in Australia (2.5 million tonnes per year).

**Most commonly wasted foods:**
1. Vegetables (29%)
2. Fruit (22%)
3. Leftovers and prepared meals
4. Bakery items (21%)
5. Dairy products
6. Meat

### Why Does Food Waste Matter for the Environment?

When food ends up in landfill, it doesn't just disappear. As it breaks down, it releases **methane**—a greenhouse gas that is **28 times more potent** than carbon dioxide.

About **92%** of household food waste in Australia still goes directly to landfill.

### How to Reduce Food Waste

**At home:**
- **Plan meals** and make a shopping list
- **Understand date labels** (remember: best-before = quality, use-by = safety)
- **Store food properly** to extend its life
- **Use leftovers** creatively
- **First in, first out:** Use older items before newer ones
- **Compost** what you can't eat

**Food rescue organisations** also play an important role:
- **Foodbank** delivers 92+ million meals per year
- **OzHarvest** rescues 441,500 meals per month
- **SecondBite** rescued 25.2 million kg of food in 2023

---

## Convenience Foods: The Trade-Offs

**Convenience foods** are commercially prepared foods designed for easy consumption and minimal preparation. They're a big part of modern life—but they come with trade-offs.

### Types of Convenience Foods

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Ready-to-eat | Pre-made sandwiches, sushi, salads |
| Ready-to-heat | Frozen meals, canned soups, microwave rice |
| Ready-to-cook | Meal kits, marinated meats, stir-fry mixes |

### Advantages

- Save time and effort
- Consistent quality and taste
- Extended shelf life
- Built-in portion control
- No cooking skills required
- Wide variety available
- Can be safer (commercially controlled processes)

### Disadvantages

- Often higher in salt, sugar, and saturated fat
- More packaging (environmental impact)
- Generally less nutritious than home-prepared equivalents
- May contain more additives
- Usually more expensive per serve
- May be ultra-processed

### Making Better Convenience Choices

Not all convenience foods are created equal! Some healthier options include:
- **Frozen vegetables and fruits:** Nutrients are preserved by flash-freezing
- **Canned legumes:** Ready-to-use protein, just rinse to reduce sodium
- **Plain Greek yoghurt:** High protein, minimal processing
- **Canned fish:** Convenient protein source
- **Microwavable brown rice:** Quick whole grain option
- **Pre-cut vegetables:** Saves preparation time without compromising nutrition

---

## Food Packaging and the Environment

Food packaging serves important purposes—it protects food, extends shelf life, provides required information, and prevents contamination. But it also creates enormous environmental problems.

### Australian Packaging Statistics

- 86% of all packaging **CAN** be recycled
- But only 56% is actually recycled
- **Plastic packaging recycling rate: only 19-20%**—the worst performer
- 84% of plastic waste goes to landfill
- 130,000 tonnes of plastic enters Australia's oceans each year

### Australia's 2025 National Packaging Targets

1. 100% of packaging to be reusable, recyclable, or compostable
2. 70% of plastic packaging being recycled or composted
3. 50% average recycled content in packaging
4. Phase out problematic single-use plastics

### What Can You Do?

Remember the hierarchy: **Reduce → Reuse → Recycle**

- **Reduce:** Buy products with less packaging; choose concentrated products; avoid single-serve packages
- **Reuse:** Choose reusable containers, bags, and bottles
- **Recycle:** Learn what can be recycled in your area; rinse containers; keep recycling uncontaminated

---

## Eating Seasonally in Australia

Eating **seasonal** produce means choosing fruits and vegetables that are naturally in season in your region. Seasonal produce is typically fresher, tastier, more nutritious, and has a lower environmental footprint.

**Summer (December–February)**
- Fruits: mangoes, berries, stone fruits (peaches, nectarines, plums), watermelon, cherries
- Vegetables: tomatoes, corn, zucchini, capsicum, cucumber, beans

**Autumn (March–May)**
- Fruits: apples, pears, figs, grapes, quinces
- Vegetables: pumpkin, mushrooms, broccoli, eggplant, sweet potato

**Winter (June–August)**
- Fruits: citrus (oranges, mandarins, lemons, grapefruit), kiwifruit
- Vegetables: cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, leafy greens, cabbage, silverbeet

**Spring (September–November)**
- Fruits: strawberries, pineapple, papaya
- Vegetables: asparagus, peas, artichokes, broad beans, spring onions

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. What is the NOVA classification system? Describe the four groups.
2. Why isn't "food miles" always a good indicator of environmental impact?
3. Which foods have the highest environmental footprint? The lowest?
4. How much food does the average Australian household waste per year in dollar terms?
5. What are three ways you could reduce food waste at home?
6. Name three convenience foods that can be healthy choices.

# Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

## Food Properties and Cooking Methods Summary

| Food Property | Recommended Methods | Why |
|---------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Tender meat** (fillet, chicken breast) | Grilling, frying, quick roasting | Doesn't need long cooking; preserves tenderness |
| **Tough meat** (brisket, shanks) | Braising, stewing, slow cooking | Needs time to convert collagen to gelatin |
| **Delicate** (fish, eggs) | Poaching, steaming, gentle baking | Gentle methods prevent overcooking and drying |
| **High starch** (potatoes, rice) | Boiling, steaming | Water needed for gelatinisation |
| **For browning** (anything you want crispy!) | Dry heat: roasting, grilling, frying | High, dry heat needed for Maillard reaction |
| **Nutrient preservation** | Steaming, microwaving, stir-frying | Minimal water contact and short cooking time |

---

## Key Temperatures to Remember

| Temperature | What Happens |
|-------------|--------------|
| 5°C | Top of safe refrigeration temperature |
| 5-60°C | **Danger zone** (bacteria multiply rapidly) |
| 62-65°C | Egg white coagulates |
| 65-70°C | Egg yolk coagulates |
| 70-82°C | Collagen converts to gelatin |
| 85-96°C | Simmering temperature |
| ~96°C | Starch fully gelatinises |
| 100°C | Water boils |
| 140°C+ | Maillard reaction begins |
| 160-180°C | Caramelisation occurs |

---

## Reading Labels: Quick Reference

**Use the per 100g column to compare products!**

| Nutrient | Low (good) | High (limit) |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Sugar | ≤5g per 100g | >15g per 100g |
| Sodium | <120mg per 100g | >400mg per 100g |
| Saturated fat | ≤1.5g per 100g | Higher amounts |
| Fibre | ≥3g per 100g is a good source | — |

**Date marking:**
- **Use-by** = Safety (don't eat after this date)
- **Best-before** = Quality (still safe after, but might not be at its best)

---

## Making Sustainable Food Choices

1. **Eat more plants, less meat** (especially beef and lamb)
2. **Reduce food waste** (plan meals, understand date labels, use leftovers)
3. **Choose seasonal produce** when possible
4. **Be thoughtful about packaging** (reduce, reuse, recycle)
5. **Cook at home more often** (generally healthier and less wasteful than convenience foods)

## Final Review Questions

1. A recipe tells you to "sear the meat to seal in the juices." Is this scientifically accurate? Explain what searing actually does.

2. You're making a cheese sauce and it turns out lumpy. Using your knowledge of gelatinisation, explain what probably went wrong and how to prevent it next time.

3. Compare these two breakfast cereals using only the Nutrition Information Panel:
   - Cereal A: 1,580kJ, 8.2g protein, 3.5g fat, 1.2g saturated fat, 62g carbs, 24g sugars, 380mg sodium per 100g
   - Cereal B: 1,510kJ, 11g protein, 6.2g fat, 0.8g saturated fat, 56g carbs, 3.8g sugars, 12mg sodium per 100g
   
   Which would be the healthier choice? Justify your answer.

4. Your grandmother stores bread in the fridge "to keep it fresh." Using your knowledge of starch retrogradation, explain why this might not be the best approach and suggest a better storage method.

5. You're designing a meal that needs to be both nutritious and environmentally sustainable. What food choices would you make and why?

6. A food label says "Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients" and shows a bar chart that's about 40% filled. What does this tell you about the product?

7. Explain why braising is the best cooking method for lamb shanks, while grilling is best for lamb cutlets. Use your knowledge of protein and collagen to support your answer.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.

TF QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Statement + "True" or "False" as correct answer. One distractor (the opposite).
STATEMENT: Unambiguously true or false. No "trick" wording.
AVOID: Absolutes ("always", "never") unless genuinely absolute. Double negatives. Compound statements.

TITLE: I can describe the scale of food waste in Australia and its environmental impact
CODE: 6.5

WHAT (concept explanation):
Australia wastes 7.6 million tonnes of food per year (312 kg per person). About 70% could have been eaten. Households are the biggest source at 32%. Food waste in landfill releases methane, which is 28 times more potent than CO2.

WHY (importance):
Understanding food waste helps you see why reducing it matters for both your budget and the environment.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
The average Australian household wastes $2,500-$3,800 worth of food per year. The most commonly wasted foods are vegetables (29%), fruit (22%), and bakery items (21%). Understanding date labels alone could significantly reduce this waste.

SUBTOPIC: Contemporary Food Issues
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores current issues in food systems including ultra-processed foods, food miles, environmental impact, food waste, convenience foods, and packaging. You will learn to evaluate food choices for both health and sustainability.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Food choices affect not just personal health but also the environment and society. Understanding contemporary food issues helps you make informed decisions that consider the broader impacts of what you eat.

TOPIC: Food Specialisations
SUBJECT: Food Studies | YEAR LEVEL: Year 8
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Analyse how characteristics and properties of food determine preparation techniques and presentation when creating solutions for healthy eating.

# Chapter 1: Healthy Eating the Australian Way

## What Are the Australian Dietary Guidelines?

The Australian Dietary Guidelines are the official advice on what Australians should eat to stay healthy. They were developed by nutrition scientists and are updated as new research emerges. The current guidelines were published in 2013.

Here are the five key guidelines:

**Guideline 1:** To achieve and maintain a healthy weight, be physically active and choose amounts of nutritious food and drinks to meet your energy needs.

**Guideline 2:** Enjoy a wide variety of nutritious foods from the five food groups every day.

**Guideline 3:** Limit intake of foods containing saturated fat, added salt, added sugars and alcohol.

**Guideline 4:** Encourage, support and promote breastfeeding.

**Guideline 5:** Care for your food; prepare and store it safely.

## The Five Food Groups

The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating organises foods into five groups. Each group provides different nutrients your body needs.

### 1. Vegetables and Legumes/Beans 🥦

This group includes all vegetables—leafy greens, root vegetables, salad vegetables, and legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and kidney beans.

**Why you need them:** Vegetables provide fibre, vitamins (especially A, C, and folate), and minerals. They're low in energy (kilojoules) but high in nutrients—we call this being "nutrient-dense."

**One serve looks like:**
- ½ cup cooked vegetables (like broccoli, carrots, or peas)
- 1 cup raw salad vegetables
- ½ medium potato
- 1 medium tomato
- ½ cup cooked legumes

### 2. Fruit 🍎

Fresh, frozen, canned (in juice, not syrup), and dried fruits all count.

**Why you need them:** Fruit provides natural sugars for energy, plus fibre, vitamin C, and other antioxidants.

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 medium apple, banana, or orange
- 2 small plums or kiwi fruits
- 1 cup diced fresh fruit
- 30g dried fruit (about 4 dried apricots)

**Important:** Fruit juice is NOT the same as whole fruit. When fruit is juiced, the fibre is removed, and the natural sugars become more concentrated. Stick to whole fruit most of the time.

### 3. Grain (Cereal) Foods 🍞

This includes bread, rice, pasta, noodles, oats, breakfast cereals, and flour-based foods.

**Why you need them:** Grains provide carbohydrates (your body's main energy source), fibre, and B vitamins.

**Choose wholegrain:** Wholegrain foods contain the entire grain—the outer bran layer (fibre), the germ (nutrients), and the endosperm (energy). White bread and white rice have had the bran and germ removed, so they have less fibre and fewer nutrients.

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 slice of bread (40g)
- ½ cup cooked rice, pasta, or noodles
- ⅔ cup wheat cereal flakes
- ¼ cup muesli

### 4. Lean Meats, Poultry, Fish, Eggs, Tofu, Nuts, Seeds, and Legumes 🥩

This group provides protein and includes animal and plant sources.

**Why you need them:** Protein is essential for building and repairing muscles, skin, hair, and other tissues. This group also provides iron, zinc, and B12.

**One serve looks like:**
- 65g cooked lean red meat (about the size of your palm)
- 80g cooked chicken
- 100g cooked fish
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup cooked legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans)
- 170g tofu
- 30g nuts or seeds

**Did you notice?** Legumes appear in TWO food groups! They count as both a vegetable AND a protein source because they provide nutrients from both groups.

### 5. Milk, Yoghurt, Cheese and Alternatives 🧀

This includes dairy products and calcium-fortified alternatives like soy milk.

**Why you need them:** These foods are our main source of calcium, which is essential for building strong bones and teeth—especially important while you're still growing!

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 cup (250ml) milk
- 2 slices (40g) hard cheese
- ¾ cup (200g) yoghurt
- 1 cup calcium-fortified soy milk

---

## How Much Do You Need?

The amount of food you need depends on your age, sex, and how active you are. Here's a guide for students your age:

| Food Group | Girls 12-13 | Boys 12-13 | Girls 14-18 | Boys 14-18 |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Vegetables | 5 serves | 5½ serves | 5 serves | 5½ serves |
| Fruit | 2 serves | 2 serves | 2 serves | 2 serves |
| Grains | 5 serves | 6 serves | 7 serves | 7 serves |
| Protein foods | 2½ serves | 2½ serves | 2½ serves | 2½ serves |
| Dairy | 3½ serves | 3½ serves | 3½ serves | 3½ serves |

You also need plenty of water—about **1.4 to 1.9 litres per day**, which is roughly 6-8 glasses.

## What About Treats? Understanding Discretionary Foods

Discretionary foods are sometimes called "sometimes foods" or "extras." They're not necessary for good health, but they can add enjoyment to eating.

**What makes a food "discretionary"?**
- High in saturated fat, added sugars, or salt
- High in energy (kilojoules) but low in nutrients
- Not part of the five food groups

**Examples include:**
- Soft drinks and energy drinks
- Chips and savoury snacks
- Chocolate, lollies, and biscuits
- Cakes, pastries, and doughnuts
- Pies, sausage rolls, and hot chips
- Ice cream
- Processed meats like salami

**How much is okay?** The guidelines suggest limiting discretionary foods to a maximum of about **600 kilojoules per day**—that's roughly:
- 2 scoops of ice cream, OR
- ⅓ of a meat pie, OR
- A few squares of chocolate, OR
- 1 small packet of chips (30g), OR
- 2-3 sweet biscuits

That's not much! This is why it's important to fill up on nutritious foods from the five food groups first.

## Nutrient Density: Getting More Bang for Your Buck

**Nutrient density** is a way of measuring how many beneficial nutrients a food provides compared to its energy (kilojoule) content.

**High nutrient-dense foods** give you lots of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and protein for relatively few kilojoules. Think vegetables, fruits, lean meats, legumes, and whole grains.

**Low nutrient-dense foods** (sometimes called "empty calories") give you lots of energy but few beneficial nutrients. Think soft drinks, chips, and lollies.

**Here's a comparison:**

Imagine you have 500 kilojoules to "spend." You could choose:
- **An apple** (about 350kJ): gives you fibre, vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants
- **A handful of pretzels** (about 350kJ): gives you... mostly just refined carbohydrates

Both have similar energy, but the apple is much more nutrient-dense. When you're choosing foods, think: "What nutrients am I getting for these kilojoules?"

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. How many serves of vegetables should a 13-year-old girl eat each day?
2. What's the difference between a "use-by" date and "best-before" date on food labels? (We'll cover this in detail later!)
3. Name a food that belongs to TWO different food groups.
4. Why is whole fruit better than fruit juice?
5. What does "nutrient-dense" mean?

# Chapter 2: The Science of Cooking

Have you ever wondered what's actually happening inside your food when you cook it? Cooking isn't just about making food taste better or making it safe to eat—it's chemistry in action! Understanding the science helps you become a better cook and make smarter food choices.

---

## How Heat Changes Proteins: Denaturation and Coagulation

Proteins are found in eggs, meat, fish, dairy, and legumes. They're made up of long chains of amino acids, folded into complex 3D shapes—kind of like a tangled ball of string.

When you apply heat to proteins, two important things happen:

### Denaturation

**Denaturation** is when the protein's folded structure unravels. Think of it like unfolding a paper crane back into a flat sheet—the shape changes permanently.

Heat isn't the only thing that causes denaturation. Acids (like lemon juice or vinegar), salt, and even mechanical action (like whisking) can also denature proteins.

### Coagulation

Once proteins are denatured, they can bond together in new ways. This is called **coagulation**—the proteins join up to form a solid or semi-solid mass.

---

## Eggs: The Perfect Example

Eggs are the best way to see protein changes in action because they're almost pure protein (plus fat in the yolk).

**Raw egg white** is clear and runny because the proteins are dissolved in water, floating around separately.

**When you heat an egg white**, the proteins denature and then coagulate—they bond together into a network that traps water. This is why cooked egg white is:
- Opaque (white) instead of clear
- Firm instead of runny
- Cannot return to its raw state (the change is permanent)

### Key Temperatures for Eggs

| Part of Egg | Coagulation Temperature |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Egg white | 62-65°C |
| Egg yolk | 65-70°C |

This is why you can cook a fried egg with a firm white but a runny yolk—the white sets at a lower temperature than the yolk!

**Try this at home:** Boil three eggs for different times—3 minutes, 6 minutes, and 10 minutes. Cut them in half and observe the differences. The 3-minute egg will have a runny yolk, the 6-minute egg will have a jammy yolk, and the 10-minute egg will be fully set.

---

## What Happens When You Cook Meat?

Meat contains several types of proteins, and they all respond differently to heat.

### Muscle Fibres

At around **60°C**, muscle proteins start to denature and coagulate. The meat becomes firmer and changes colour—this is why raw meat is red but cooked meat turns grey or brown.

The red colour in raw meat comes from a protein called **myoglobin**. When heated, myoglobin denatures and oxidises, changing from red → pink → grey/brown.

### Why Overcooked Meat Is Tough and Dry

When you cook meat at high temperatures or for too long, the protein fibres contract tightly. Imagine wringing out a wet sponge—that's what's happening to the moisture in your meat. The proteins squeeze out the water, leaving you with tough, dry meat.

**The lesson:** Don't overcook your steak!

### Collagen: Turning Tough Cuts Tender

Some cuts of meat have lots of **collagen**—a tough connective tissue that holds muscles together. These are usually cheaper cuts from hard-working parts of the animal, like:
- Beef brisket (chest)
- Lamb shanks (legs)
- Pork shoulder
- Beef cheeks

If you quickly grill these cuts, they'll be impossibly tough and chewy. But here's the magic: when collagen is heated slowly at temperatures between **70-82°C** for a long time (2-4 hours), it transforms into **gelatin**—a soft, silky substance that makes meat "fall off the bone" tender.

This is the science behind slow-cooked stews and braised dishes. Low and slow = tender and delicious!

---

## How Heat Changes Starches: Gelatinisation

Starches are found in foods like flour, rice, pasta, potatoes, and corn. Understanding how starches behave when heated is essential for making sauces, gravies, and baked goods.

### What Is Gelatinisation?

**Gelatinisation** is what happens when you heat starch in liquid. Here's the process:

1. **Starting point:** Starch exists as tiny granules—microscopic packets of starch molecules.

2. **Around 60°C:** The granules start absorbing water and swelling, like tiny sponges.

3. **Around 85°C:** The granules have absorbed about 5 times their weight in water and are fully swollen.

4. **Around 96°C:** The granules burst open, releasing starch molecules into the liquid. These molecules tangle together, thickening the liquid.

5. **On cooling:** The mixture sets into a gel.

### Making a White Sauce (Béchamel)

Making a white sauce is the perfect demonstration of gelatinisation. Here's what's happening:

1. You make a **roux** by cooking butter and flour together. This coats the starch granules in fat.

2. You gradually add milk while stirring constantly.

3. As you heat the sauce, the starch granules absorb the milk and swell.

4. When the sauce reaches near-boiling (about 96°C), the granules burst and release their starch, thickening the sauce.

**Why do we stir constantly?** Stirring serves two purposes:
- It distributes heat evenly so all the starch granules gelatinise at the same rate
- It prevents lumps by separating granules as they swell

**Why do we add liquid gradually?** Adding liquid slowly allows each addition to be fully incorporated before more is added. If you dump all the liquid in at once, the starch granules clump together and you get lumps!

---

## Why Does Bread Go Stale?

Here's something that might surprise you: **bread goes stale faster in the fridge than at room temperature!**

This seems wrong—doesn't refrigeration preserve food? Yes, but staling isn't about spoilage; it's about a process called **retrogradation**.

### What Is Retrogradation?

When bread is baked, the starches gelatinise—they absorb water and swell, giving bread its soft, moist texture.

But over time, those gelatinised starch molecules slowly reorganise and recrystallise. As they do, they push water out. This makes bread firm, dry, and stale.

**The surprising part:** This process happens fastest at refrigerator temperatures (around 4°C)! At room temperature, bread stales more slowly. In the freezer, the process essentially stops.

**Life hack:** If your bread has gone stale, try toasting it! Heat temporarily reverses retrogradation, which is why toast can make stale bread taste fresh again.

**Best bread storage:**
- Eat within a few days: room temperature in a bread bin
- Longer storage: freeze it, then toast slices as needed

---

## The Maillard Reaction: The Science of Delicious Browning

Have you ever noticed that toast, seared steak, roasted coffee, and baked cookies all have something in common? They're all brown, and they all smell amazing. That's the **Maillard reaction** at work!

### What Is the Maillard Reaction?

The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between **amino acids** (from proteins) and **reducing sugars** (like glucose) that occurs when food is heated to high temperatures.

The reaction creates:
- Brown colour
- Hundreds of new flavour compounds
- Appealing aromas

It was named after French chemist Louis-Camille Maillard, who first described it in 1912.

### Key Requirements

The Maillard reaction needs:
- **High temperatures:** Above 140-165°C
- **Dry conditions:** This is important!

Water boils at 100°C. As long as there's water present, the temperature can't get high enough for the Maillard reaction. This is why:
- Boiled potatoes are pale, but roasted potatoes are golden brown
- Steamed chicken is white, but grilled chicken has brown grill marks
- Wet bread won't toast properly

**Try this:** Put a piece of damp bread in the toaster. It won't brown properly until all the water evaporates. Then browning starts rapidly!

### Maillard Reaction vs Caramelisation

These are two different browning reactions that are often confused:

| Feature | Maillard Reaction | Caramelisation |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| What's needed | Amino acids + sugars + heat | Sugars + heat only |
| Temperature | ~140°C and above | ~160-180°C (higher) |
| Flavour result | Complex, savoury, meaty, nutty | Sweet, butterscotch, toffee |
| Examples | Toast, seared meat, roasted coffee | Caramel sauce, crème brûlée |

**Caramelisation** is the browning of sugars alone—no proteins needed. It requires higher temperatures and produces a different (sweeter) flavour profile.

## Common Cooking Myth: "Searing Seals in Juices"

You might have heard that you should sear meat at high heat to "seal in the juices." This is one of the most persistent myths in cooking, but it's completely false!

Scientists have tested this by weighing steaks before and after cooking. They found that seared steaks actually **lose MORE moisture** than steaks cooked at lower temperatures.

So why do we sear meat? For the **Maillard reaction**! Searing creates that delicious brown crust, complex flavours, and appealing aroma. It doesn't seal in anything—it just makes meat taste amazing.

---

## Emulsification: Mixing the Unmixable

Oil and water don't mix—everyone knows that. If you pour oil into water, the oil floats on top in a separate layer. But what about mayonnaise? It's made from oil and vinegar (which is mostly water), yet it's a smooth, creamy mixture. How does that work?

### What Is an Emulsion?

An **emulsion** is a mixture of two liquids that normally don't mix, where one liquid is dispersed as tiny droplets throughout the other.

**Types of emulsions:**
- **Oil-in-water (O/W):** Oil droplets dispersed in water. Examples: mayonnaise, milk, salad dressings
- **Water-in-oil (W/O):** Water droplets dispersed in oil. Examples: butter, margarine

### The Role of Emulsifiers

An **emulsifier** is a substance that helps hold emulsions together. Emulsifiers work because they have two different ends:
- A **hydrophilic** (water-loving) end that bonds with water
- A **hydrophobic** (water-fearing) end that bonds with oil

The emulsifier positions itself at the boundary between oil and water droplets, creating a protective coating around each droplet and preventing them from joining back together.

### Lecithin: Nature's Emulsifier

**Lecithin** is a natural emulsifier found in egg yolks (about 1.2% of the yolk). This is why egg yolks are used to make mayonnaise, hollandaise sauce, and other emulsified sauces.

### Making Mayonnaise: Emulsion in Action

Traditional mayonnaise contains:
- Oil (70-80%)
- Egg yolk (the emulsifier)
- Vinegar or lemon juice (acid)
- Salt and seasonings

**The technique is crucial:**
1. Start with egg yolk and whisk in a small amount of acid
2. Add oil **very slowly**—just drops at first—while whisking vigorously
3. The lecithin in the egg yolk coats each tiny oil droplet before more oil is added
4. Gradually you can add oil faster as the emulsion stabilises

**Why emulsions "split":**
- Adding oil too quickly (droplets don't get coated before more are added)
- Not enough emulsifier (egg yolk)
- Temperature extremes (too cold or too hot)
- Wrong proportions

If your mayonnaise splits (separates into oily and watery layers), you can often rescue it by starting with a fresh egg yolk and slowly whisking the broken mayonnaise into it.

---

## How Acids Affect Food

Acids—like lemon juice, vinegar, lime juice, and wine—are powerful ingredients in cooking. Here's what they do:

### Tenderising Meat with Marinades

Remember how heat denatures proteins? Acids do the same thing! When you marinate meat in an acidic liquid, the acid denatures the proteins on the surface, making the meat more tender.

**But be careful:** If you marinate meat for too long, the acid will denature proteins too much, making the meat mushy and unpleasant. For most meats, **30 minutes to 2 hours** is enough.

### Preventing Browning

When you cut an apple, the cut surface turns brown within minutes. This is called **enzymatic browning**, and here's what's happening:

1. Cutting damages the apple's cells
2. An enzyme called **polyphenol oxidase (PPO)** is released
3. PPO reacts with oxygen in the air
4. Brown pigments are produced

**How lemon juice prevents browning:**
- **The acid denatures the enzyme:** PPO works best at pH 5-7, but lemon juice has a pH of about 2. At this low pH, the enzyme can't function.
- **Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant:** The vitamin C in lemon juice reacts with oxygen before PPO can, using up the oxygen needed for browning.

**Practical application:** When preparing apple slices for a lunch box or fruit platter, toss them in a little lemon juice to keep them looking fresh!

### Acids in Baking

Have you noticed that many recipes call for buttermilk and baking soda together? Here's why:

Buttermilk contains **lactic acid**. Baking soda is a **base** (sodium bicarbonate). When acid and base combine, they react and produce **carbon dioxide gas**.

Those CO₂ bubbles get trapped in the batter and make it rise—creating fluffy pancakes, tender scones, and light cakes.

**Important:** This reaction happens immediately when the ingredients combine, which is why recipes tell you to mix wet and dry ingredients separately, then combine them just before baking. If you let the batter sit too long, the bubbles escape before baking!

# Chapter 3: Cooking Methods

Choosing the right cooking method is one of the most important decisions you'll make in the kitchen. The properties of your ingredients—how much fat they contain, how tough or tender they are, how delicate their texture is—should guide your choice.

---

## Wet (Moist Heat) Cooking Methods

These methods use water or other liquids as the cooking medium. They're generally gentler and can't produce browning (because water limits the temperature to 100°C).

### Boiling (100°C)

**What it looks like:** Large bubbles rapidly breaking the surface—a "rolling boil."

**Best for:** Pasta, rice, potatoes, hard vegetables, eggs

**Advantages:** Fast cooking, kills bacteria effectively

**Disadvantages:** Can break up delicate foods, causes nutrients to leach into the water (especially water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C)

**Tip:** Don't throw out the cooking water from vegetables—use it in soups, gravies, or sauces to recapture some of those nutrients!

### Simmering (85-96°C)

**What it looks like:** Gentle bubbles rising to the surface, but not a full rolling boil.

**Best for:** Soups, stews, stocks, rice, sauces, tough cuts of meat

**Advantages:** Gentler than boiling, tenderises tough cuts, develops flavours over time

**Why not boil meat?** Boiling meat at 100°C causes proteins to contract rapidly, squeezing out moisture and making meat tough. Simmering is gentler.

### Poaching (70-85°C)

**What it looks like:** Very gentle—barely any bubbles at all. The surface just shimmers.

**Best for:** Eggs, fish, chicken breast, delicate fruit (like pears)

**Advantages:** Extremely gentle cooking perfect for delicate foods, no added fat, maintains moisture

**Example:** Poached eggs cook perfectly at this low temperature—the white sets gently while the yolk stays runny.

### Steaming (100°C+)

**What it looks like:** Food sits on a rack or in a basket above boiling water, never touching the water itself.

**Best for:** Vegetables, fish, dumplings, dim sum

**Advantages:** 
- **Retains the most nutrients** of any cooking method (vitamins don't leach into water)
- No added fat
- Preserves bright colours
- Gentle cooking

**Why steaming retains more nutrients:** Water-soluble vitamins (like vitamin C and B vitamins) dissolve into cooking water when you boil vegetables. Since steamed food never touches water, these vitamins stay in the food.

### Braising (135-165°C, combination method)

**What it looks like:** Food is first seared at high heat, then slow-cooked partially covered in liquid in the oven.

**Best for:** Tough cuts of meat (brisket, shanks, osso buco), root vegetables

**How it works:**
1. **Sear** the meat first at high heat (Maillard reaction = flavour!)
2. Add aromatics (onions, garlic, herbs) and liquid (stock, wine, tomatoes)
3. Cover and cook slowly in the oven at 135-165°C for 2-4 hours
4. The long, slow cooking converts **collagen to gelatin**, making tough meat incredibly tender

**Examples:** Beef bourguignon, lamb shanks, osso buco, pulled pork

---

## Dry Heat Cooking Methods

These methods use hot air, hot fat, or direct heat—no water involved. Because there's no water to limit the temperature, these methods can reach the high temperatures needed for browning.

### Baking (150-200°C)

**What it looks like:** Enclosed oven, hot air circulates around the food.

**Best for:** Bread, cakes, pastries, casseroles, fish

**Advantages:** Even cooking, creates golden crusts, hands-off cooking

### Roasting (180-230°C)

**What it looks like:** Similar to baking but typically at higher temperatures.

**Best for:** Large cuts of meat, whole chickens, vegetables

**What's happening:** The high heat creates a caramelised, crispy exterior through Maillard reaction and caramelisation, while the inside cooks through more slowly.

**Tip for roasting vegetables:** Cut them into similar-sized pieces so they cook evenly, toss with oil, spread in a single layer (not crowded), and roast at high heat until caramelised.

### Grilling (Very High Direct Heat)

**What it looks like:** Heat comes from below (barbecue) or above (grill element), cooking by direct radiant heat.

**Best for:** Steaks, chops, burgers, sausages, vegetables, kebabs

**Advantages:** 
- Creates char marks and smoky flavour
- Fat drips away from the food
- Quick cooking
- No added fat needed

**Best for tender cuts:** Grilling is a fast, high-heat method. It works best for tender cuts that don't need long cooking—like sirloin steak, lamb cutlets, or chicken breast.

### Shallow Frying (160-180°C)

**What it looks like:** Oil covers about half the food; you need to turn the food to cook both sides.

**Best for:** Eggs, fish fillets, schnitzel, pancakes, hash browns

**The key:** Oil must be hot enough that food sizzles immediately when added. If the oil isn't hot enough, food absorbs more oil and becomes greasy.

### Deep Frying (160-190°C)

**What it looks like:** Food is completely submerged in hot oil.

**Best for:** Chips, battered fish, doughnuts, spring rolls, fried chicken

**What's happening:** The hot oil rapidly heats the surface of the food, creating a crispy crust through the Maillard reaction. The interior steams from the inside out.

**Safety warning:** Hot oil is extremely dangerous! Never leave a deep fryer unattended, never fill it more than half full, and never add wet food to hot oil (it will splatter violently).

---

## Matching Cooking Methods to Food Properties

Understanding **why** certain foods suit certain methods is the key to becoming a skilled cook.

### Tender vs Tough Cuts of Meat

| Cut Type | Examples | Properties | Best Methods |
|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Tender** | Fillet steak, sirloin, chicken breast, pork loin | Little connective tissue, naturally tender | Grilling, frying, quick roasting |
| **Tough** | Beef brisket, lamb shank, pork shoulder, chuck | Lots of connective tissue (collagen) | Braising, stewing, slow cooking |

**Why:** Tender cuts are already soft, so quick, high-heat cooking preserves their texture. Tough cuts need long, slow cooking to convert their collagen into gelatin.

**What happens if you get it wrong:**
- Grill a lamb shank → tough, chewy, inedible
- Braise a fillet steak → mushy, overcooked, flavourless

### Delicate Foods

Delicate foods—like fish fillets, eggs, and chicken breast—have properties that require gentle handling:
- **Fish** flakes apart easily and dries out quickly
- **Eggs** have proteins that set rapidly
- **Chicken breast** is low in fat, so it dries out easily

**Best methods for delicate foods:** Poaching, steaming, gentle baking, or quick pan-frying. Avoid high, dry heat that will dry them out.

### Why You Wouldn't...

- **Boil a steak:** It would turn grey (no Maillard browning), become tough (proteins contract rapidly), and lose flavour to the water.

- **Deep-fry custard:** It would fall apart completely and might even explode from the water content turning to steam!

- **Grill a delicate fish on a barbecue without foil:** It would stick to the grates, fall apart, and dry out before it's cooked through.

- **Roast leafy greens:** They would burn and become bitter within minutes.

---

## Nutrient Retention: Which Methods Are Best?

Different cooking methods affect nutrient content in different ways. This matters most for **water-soluble vitamins** (vitamin C and B vitamins) which are sensitive to heat and can dissolve into cooking water.

**Cooking methods ranked for nutrient retention (best to worst):**

1. **Steaming** ⭐ Best—no contact with water, short cooking time
2. **Microwaving**—quick cooking, minimal water needed
3. **Stir-frying**—short cooking time, no water
4. **Roasting/baking**—dry heat preserves fat-soluble vitamins
5. **Boiling** ⚠️ Worst—vitamins leach into water, longer cooking times

**Tips for preserving nutrients:**
- Cook vegetables for the shortest time possible
- Use the smallest amount of water necessary
- Cut vegetables into larger pieces (less surface area = less nutrient loss)
- Don't throw away cooking water—use it in soups or sauces

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. What's the difference between simmering and boiling?
2. Why is steaming the best cooking method for preserving nutrients?
3. Which cooking method would you use for a tough beef brisket? Explain why.
4. Why can't wet cooking methods create browning on food?
5. What's the difference between baking and roasting?

# Chapter 4: Reading Food Labels

Food labels are like a window into what you're really eating. Learning to read them helps you make informed choices about your food. In Australia, food labelling is regulated by **Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ)**, which sets strict rules about what must appear on food packages.

---

## What Must Appear on Australian Food Labels?

Most packaged foods in Australia must display:

1. **Food name/description**
2. **Ingredient list**
3. **Date marking** (use-by or best-before)
4. **Nutrition Information Panel (NIP)**
5. **Allergen declarations**
6. **Name and address** of the manufacturer or supplier
7. **Country of origin**
8. **Lot identification** (for tracing purposes)
9. **Directions for use/storage** (where needed for safety)
10. **Warning statements** (where required)
11. **Net weight or volume**

**What's exempt?** Some foods don't need full labelling, including:
- Foods made and sold on the same premises (like at a bakery or deli counter)
- Unpackaged foods
- Very small packages (under 100cm²)
- Some single-ingredient foods

---

## Understanding the Nutrition Information Panel (NIP)

The Nutrition Information Panel is your most valuable tool for comparing foods. Here's what you'll find:

### Mandatory Information

Every NIP must include:
- **Energy** (in kilojoules, kJ)
- **Protein** (in grams)
- **Fat, total** (in grams)
- **Saturated fat** (in grams)
- **Carbohydrate** (in grams)
- **Sugars** (in grams)
- **Sodium** (in milligrams)

### Per Serve vs Per 100g: Why Both Matter

You'll notice the NIP has two columns: "Per Serve" and "Per 100g" (or per 100ml for liquids).

**Per serve** tells you what you'll consume in one suggested serving. This is useful for tracking your actual intake.

**BUT BEWARE:** Manufacturers decide what a "serving" is, and they often use small serving sizes to make the numbers look better! A packet of chips might list a serving as 25g, but most people eat the whole 50g packet.

**Per 100g** is the standardised measure that allows you to **fairly compare** different products. It's the same amount across all products, so it's the best way to compare which muesli bar is lower in sugar or which bread is higher in fibre.

**Golden rule:** Always use the "per 100g" column when comparing products!

### What Do the Numbers Mean?

Here's a guide to interpreting nutrient levels:

| Nutrient | Low (good) | High (limit) |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Sugar** | ≤5g per 100g | >15g per 100g |
| **Sodium** | <120mg per 100g | >400mg per 100g |
| **Saturated fat** | ≤1.5g per 100g | Higher amounts |
| **Fibre** | ≥3g per 100g is a good source | — |

**Example comparison:**

| Breakfast Cereal | Sugar per 100g | Verdict |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Cereal A | 3.2g | Low sugar ✓ |
| Cereal B | 22g | High sugar ✗ |
| Cereal C | 12g | Medium |

## Decoding the Ingredient List

The ingredient list tells you exactly what's in the food, listed in **descending order by weight**. The first ingredient is what the product contains most of, and the last is what it contains least of.

**What to look for:**
- If sugar, fat, or salt appears in the first few ingredients, the product contains a lot of it
- Watch for sugar's many names: sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, agave, rice malt syrup—they're all added sugars!
- Numbers like (102) or (621) refer to food additives

**Example ingredient list:**
> Wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil, cocoa powder (5%), glucose syrup, salt, raising agents (500, 501), emulsifier (soy lecithin), flavour.

This product has sugar as the second ingredient and glucose syrup as the fifth—that's two types of sugar high on the list. The (5%) next to cocoa powder tells you exactly how much is in there.

## Understanding Allergen Declarations

Food allergies can be life-threatening, so Australian food law requires allergens to be clearly declared.

### The Mandatory Allergens (as of 2024)

These allergens MUST be declared in Australia:
- Peanuts
- Tree nuts (the specific type must be named, e.g., "almonds," "cashews")
- Milk
- Eggs
- Sesame seeds
- Fish (the type must be named)
- Crustaceans (the type must be named, e.g., "prawns")
- Molluscs (the type must be named, e.g., "oysters")
- Soy/soya
- Cereals containing gluten (wheat, barley, rye, oats)
- Lupin
- Sulphites (if 10mg/kg or more)

### How Allergens Are Displayed

Allergens must be:
1. Highlighted in **bold** within the ingredient list
2. Listed in a separate "**Contains:**" statement in the same area as the ingredients

**Example:**
> Ingredients: Wheat flour, **milk**, sugar, **egg**, vegetable oil, **almonds**, salt.
> 
> **Contains: Wheat (gluten), milk, egg, tree nuts (almonds).**

### "May Contain" Statements

You might see statements like "May contain traces of peanuts." These are **voluntary**—companies use them to warn that a product might have been accidentally contaminated during manufacturing (for example, if peanut products are made on the same equipment).

These statements aren't regulated by law, so different companies use them differently. People with allergies need to decide their own comfort level with "may contain" warnings.

---

## Date Marking: Use-By vs Best-Before

This is one of the most misunderstood parts of food labelling!

### Use-By Date

**"Use by [date]"**

This is about **FOOD SAFETY**. Foods with a use-by date may become unsafe after this date, even if they look and smell fine.

**Important rules:**
- It's **illegal** to sell food after its use-by date
- You should **not eat** food after the use-by date
- Used for foods that might become dangerous, like fresh meat, dairy, and ready-to-eat salads

### Best-Before Date

**"Best before [date]"**

This is about **FOOD QUALITY**. The food is still safe to eat after this date, but it might not be at its best—it could be stale, have less flavour, or changed texture.

**Important rules:**
- It **is legal** to sell food after its best-before date (as long as it's not damaged or deteriorated)
- You **can eat** food after the best-before date if it looks and smells okay
- Used for foods like canned goods, cereals, biscuits, and snack foods

### Special Cases

- **Bread:** Products with a shelf life under 7 days can use "baked on" or "baked for" instead
- **Long-life foods:** Products with a shelf life of 2 years or more (like some canned foods) don't need date marking

**Don't waste food unnecessarily!** Understanding this difference helps reduce food waste. That can of beans two months past its best-before date? Probably still perfectly good. That chicken one day past its use-by date? Not worth the risk.

---

## Health Star Rating System

The **Health Star Rating** is a voluntary front-of-pack label that rates a food's overall nutritional profile from ½ star to 5 stars. More stars = healthier choice.

### How It Works

The rating is calculated by looking at:
- **Risk-increasing nutrients:** Energy, saturated fat, total sugars, sodium (these subtract points)
- **Risk-decreasing nutrients:** Protein, fibre, fruit/vegetable/nut/legume content (these add points)

### How to Use Health Stars

✅ **Do:** Compare similar products (two yoghurts, two breakfast cereals, two pasta sauces)

❌ **Don't:** Compare across categories (chips to bread, biscuits to vegetables)

❌ **Don't:** Assume a higher rating means a food is "healthy"—compare to similar products only

### Limitations

- **It's voluntary:** Only about 35% of eligible products display Health Star Ratings. Companies might only show them on their higher-scoring products.
- **It doesn't consider processing:** A highly processed food could still score reasonably well
- **Fresh produce:** Fresh fruit and vegetables automatically get 5 stars—they don't need the label!

---

## Country of Origin Labelling

Australian food labels must tell you where the food comes from. Look for the kangaroo-in-a-triangle logo and the bar chart.

### Understanding the Claims

| Claim | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Grown in Australia** | All significant ingredients grown in Australia |
| **Product of Australia** | All ingredients AND virtually all processing done in Australia |
| **Made in Australia** | Product underwent its "last substantial transformation" in Australia (but ingredients may be imported) |
| **Packed in Australia** | Only packaged here; ingredients from elsewhere |

### The Bar Chart

The bar chart shows the percentage of Australian ingredients, filled in 10% increments.

For example:
- A full bar (100%) means all ingredients are Australian
- A half-filled bar (50%) means about half the ingredients are Australian
- An empty bar means minimal Australian ingredients

**Note:** Only products that are grown, produced, or made in Australia can use the kangaroo logo.

---

## Nutrition and Health Claims

You'll often see claims on food packaging like "low fat" or "high in fibre." These claims are regulated—they can only be used if the product meets specific criteria.

### Nutrition Content Claims

These describe the nutrient content:

| Claim | What It Must Mean |
|-------|-------------------|
| Low fat | ≤3g per 100g (solid foods) |
| Fat free | ≤0.15g per 100g |
| Reduced fat | ≥25% less fat than the regular version |
| Low sugar | ≤5g per 100g (solid foods) |
| No added sugar | No sugar added (but may contain natural sugars) |
| Low sodium/salt | ≤120mg sodium per 100g |
| Good source of fibre | ≥4g fibre per serve |

### Watch Out For...

**"Reduced fat" doesn't mean "low fat."** A product only needs to have 25% less fat than its regular version. If the original had 40g fat per 100g, the "reduced fat" version could still have 30g—that's still high!

**"No added sugar" doesn't mean "no sugar."** A product can be naturally high in sugar (like fruit juice) and still claim "no added sugar."

**"Light" or "Lite" can mean anything.** These terms might refer to colour, taste, or texture—not necessarily fewer kilojoules. Always check the NIP.

**"Natural" is not a regulated term.** Any product can claim to be "natural"—it doesn't guarantee anything about health or quality.

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. Why should you use "per 100g" rather than "per serve" when comparing products?
2. What's the difference between a use-by date and a best-before date?
3. A product is labelled "Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients." What does this tell you?
4. A breakfast cereal contains 12g of sugar per 100g. Is this low, medium, or high?
5. If peanut oil is used in a product, how must it be displayed on the label?

---

# Chapter 5: Sensory Evaluation

When food scientists develop new products or chefs perfect recipes, they don't just rely on their own opinions. They use systematic **sensory evaluation** methods to objectively assess food. Understanding these techniques will help you evaluate food more critically and communicate about food more effectively.

---

## The Five Basic Tastes

Humans can detect five basic taste sensations. Each one serves an evolutionary purpose—helping our ancestors identify nutritious foods and avoid dangerous ones.

### Sweet

**What causes it:** Sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose) and some artificial sweeteners

**Examples:** Honey, ripe fruit, chocolate, lollies, sweet potato

**Purpose:** Signals energy-rich foods (carbohydrates)

### Sour

**What causes it:** Acids, including citric acid, acetic acid (vinegar), and lactic acid (yoghurt)

**Examples:** Lemons, vinegar, sour cream, green apples, sourdough bread

**Purpose:** Helps detect unripe fruit or potentially spoiled food

### Salty

**What causes it:** Sodium chloride (table salt) and other mineral salts

**Examples:** Chips, soy sauce, cheese, cured meats, seaweed

**Purpose:** Indicates sodium, which is essential for body functions

### Bitter

**What causes it:** Many different compounds (there are about 35 different bitter taste receptors!)

**Examples:** Coffee, dark chocolate, Brussels sprouts, grapefruit pith, some leafy greens

**Purpose:** Originally served as a warning against toxic plants (many poisons taste bitter)

### Umami

**What causes it:** Glutamate (an amino acid) and certain nucleotides

**Examples:** Parmesan cheese, ripe tomatoes, mushrooms, soy sauce, Vegemite, miso, aged meats

**Discovered:** Japanese scientist Dr. Kikunae Ikeda identified umami in 1908. The name means "pleasant savoury taste" or "deliciousness" in Japanese.

**Purpose:** Indicates protein-rich foods

---

## The Tongue Map Myth

You may have seen diagrams showing different parts of the tongue tasting different things—sweet at the tip, bitter at the back, and so on. 

**This is completely wrong!**

The "tongue map" was based on a misinterpretation of research from the 1800s. Scientists have since proven that taste receptors for all five tastes are distributed across the **entire tongue**. You can taste sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami anywhere on your tongue.

**Try it yourself:** Put a little salt on the very tip of your tongue. You'll taste it immediately—proving that saltiness isn't restricted to the sides of your tongue!

---

## Taste Interactions

Tastes don't exist in isolation—they interact with each other in interesting ways:

- **Salt enhances sweetness** (this is why salted caramel works!)
- **Salt reduces bitterness** (try a tiny bit of salt on grapefruit)
- **Sweet and sour balance each other** (sweet and sour sauce, lemonade)
- **Umami can reduce the need for salt** (adding Parmesan to pasta means you need less salt)
- **Sweet masks bitterness** (sugar in coffee)

Understanding these interactions helps cooks balance flavours in dishes.

---

## Beyond Taste: The Multi-Sensory Experience

When we talk about how food "tastes," we're actually talking about much more than just our taste buds. Our perception of food involves all our senses working together.

### Smell (Olfaction)

Here's something surprising: **approximately 80% of what we perceive as "taste" actually comes from smell!**

Think about the last time you had a cold and couldn't smell anything. Food probably seemed bland and flavourless, right? That's because the complex flavours we enjoy come largely from volatile aroma compounds.

There are two ways smell contributes to eating:
- **Orthonasal:** Smelling through your nostrils before you eat (the aroma of fresh bread)
- **Retronasal:** Aromas travelling from your mouth to your nose while you eat (the full flavour experience)

### Sight

"We eat with our eyes first." Before we even taste food, we've already judged it based on how it looks.

Visual cues include:
- **Colour:** Bright, vibrant colours suggest freshness; brown or grey suggests staleness
- **Presentation:** Well-arranged food appears more appetising
- **Portion size:** Affects expectations

**Example:** Studies have shown that people rate orange juice as tasting more "orangey" when it's a deeper orange colour—even if the actual flavour is identical!

### Touch/Texture

Our mouth has very sensitive touch receptors. Texture contributes enormously to food enjoyment—think about the difference between a crispy chip and a soggy one!

Temperature is also detected through touch and dramatically affects our perception of food.

### Sound

The sounds food makes—crunch, crackle, sizzle—contribute to our perception of freshness and quality. A crisp apple that makes a satisfying crunch seems fresher than a soft one that doesn't.

---

## Texture: The Vocabulary

Being able to describe food texture precisely is an important skill. Here are some common texture descriptors:

| Term | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Crispy** | Light, thin, shatters easily with a high-pitched sound | Potato chips, crackers, fried chicken skin |
| **Crunchy** | Firm, requires force to bite through, makes a cracking sound | Raw carrot, apple, granola |
| **Chewy** | Requires prolonged chewing | Toffee, dried fruit, crusty bread |
| **Tender** | Easy to cut or bite through | Well-cooked steak, ripe pear |
| **Tough** | Difficult to bite or chew | Overcooked meat, stale bread |
| **Smooth** | No graininess or lumps | Custard, puréed soup |
| **Creamy** | Rich, smooth, coats the mouth | Ice cream, butter, mayonnaise |
| **Flaky** | Breaks into thin layers | Croissant, baked fish, puff pastry |
| **Crumbly** | Falls apart easily into small pieces | Shortbread, feta cheese |
| **Moist** | Contains noticeable moisture | Fresh cake, ripe watermelon |
| **Dry** | Lacks moisture | Crackers, overcooked chicken |
| **Juicy** | Releases liquid when bitten | Orange segments, medium-rare steak |

### Texture Contrast

Great dishes often include **texture contrast**—combining different textures makes eating more interesting and stimulating. Think about:
- Croutons (crunchy) in smooth soup
- Nuts (crunchy) in creamy ice cream
- Crispy bacon on creamy pasta
- Crunchy granola on smooth yoghurt

---

## Sensory Evaluation Methods

Food scientists use structured tests to evaluate food objectively. Here are some methods you might use in class:

### Triangle Test (Discrimination Test)

**Purpose:** To determine if people can detect a difference between two products.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive three samples—two identical, one different
2. Samples are labelled with random 3-digit codes (like 472, 815, 293)
3. Tasters must identify the "odd one out"

**The maths:** The chance of guessing correctly by accident is 1 in 3 (33%). If significantly more than 33% of tasters get it right, there's a real detectable difference.

**Example use:** A food company changes their recipe to use less salt. Before launching the new version, they run a triangle test to see if consumers can actually taste the difference.

### Ranking Test

**Purpose:** To order several samples by intensity of a characteristic.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive several samples (usually 3-6)
2. Each sample is coded with random numbers
3. Tasters arrange them in order (e.g., "sweetest to least sweet" or "crunchiest to softest")

**Example use:** Comparing five different apple varieties to rank them from sweetest to sourest.

### Hedonic Test (Preference Test)

**Purpose:** To measure how much people like a product.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive samples
2. They rate each sample on a 9-point scale:
   - 1 = Dislike extremely
   - 5 = Neither like nor dislike
   - 9 = Like extremely
3. Results are averaged to get an overall acceptance score

**Example use:** A café wants to know which of three new smoothie recipes customers prefer.

---

## Setting Up Fair Sensory Tests

For sensory tests to give reliable results, they must be conducted carefully. Here are the key principles:

### Eliminate Bias

- **Use blind testing:** Samples should be coded with random 3-digit numbers, not "Sample A" or "new recipe" vs "old recipe"
- **Randomise order:** Each taster should receive samples in a different random order
- **No talking:** Tasters shouldn't discuss samples during testing—they might influence each other

### Control Variables

- **Same temperature:** Serve all samples at the same temperature
- **Same quantity:** Give the same amount of each sample
- **Same containers:** Use identical serving vessels

### Cleanse the Palate

- **Between samples:** Provide plain water and/or plain crackers
- **Wait time:** Allow 30 seconds between samples
- **No strong flavours beforehand:** Tasters shouldn't have just eaten or drunk strongly flavoured items

### Record Results

- **Record immediately:** Tasters should write down their responses right after tasting each sample
- **Don't change answers:** Once recorded, answers shouldn't be changed

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. What are the five basic taste sensations?
2. What does "umami" mean, and what foods contain it?
3. Why is the "tongue map" a myth?
4. Approximately what percentage of flavour perception comes from smell?
5. What's the difference between a hedonic test and a triangle test?
6. Why do we use random 3-digit codes instead of names for samples in sensory tests?

# Chapter 6: Contemporary Food Issues

Food doesn't just affect our health—it affects the entire planet. In this chapter, we'll explore some of the big issues facing our food system today, with a focus on Australia.

## Ultra-Processed Foods: What Are They?

You've probably heard that you should eat less "processed food," but what does that actually mean? Scientists use a classification system called **NOVA** to categorise foods by how processed they are.

### The NOVA Classification

**Group 1: Unprocessed or Minimally Processed Foods**

These are foods in their natural state or with minimal changes (like cleaning, cutting, or freezing).

*Examples:* Fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, plain milk, raw meat, fish, nuts, plain rice

**Group 2: Processed Culinary Ingredients**

These are substances extracted from Group 1 foods, used for cooking.

*Examples:* Olive oil, butter, sugar, salt, honey, flour

**Group 3: Processed Foods**

These are made by combining Groups 1 and 2 using traditional methods like canning, bottling, or simple cooking.

*Examples:* Canned vegetables, cheese, bread, canned fish, salted nuts

**Group 4: Ultra-Processed Foods**

These are industrial formulations with many ingredients, including additives you wouldn't find in a home kitchen.

*Examples:* Soft drinks, chips, instant noodles, packaged snacks, chicken nuggets, mass-produced cakes, many breakfast cereals

### How to Spot Ultra-Processed Foods

Look at the ingredient list. Ultra-processed foods typically have:
- **Long ingredient lists** (often 5+ ingredients)
- **Ingredients you wouldn't use at home**, like:
  - High-fructose corn syrup
  - Hydrogenated oils
  - Protein isolates
  - Maltodextrin
- **Cosmetic additives** to improve appearance, texture, or flavour:
  - Colours (e.g., 102, 110)
  - Flavours
  - Emulsifiers
  - Thickeners

### Why Does It Matter?

Research links high consumption of ultra-processed foods to increased risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. These foods are designed to be hyper-palatable (extremely tasty and hard to stop eating) and convenient.

**Australian statistics:**
- About **42%** of the total energy in a typical Australian diet comes from ultra-processed foods
- **60%** of packaged foods in Australian supermarkets are classified as ultra-processed

---

## Food Miles and Environmental Impact

**Food miles** measure the distance food travels from where it's produced to where it's consumed. It seems logical that food travelling shorter distances would be better for the environment, but the reality is more complicated.

### The Case FOR Considering Food Miles

- Supports local farmers and local economies
- Food often arrives fresher
- Generally requires less packaging
- Reduces transport emissions

### But It's Not That Simple...

Here's where it gets interesting: **how food is produced often matters more than how far it travels.**

Consider these examples:

**Example 1: Tomatoes**
- Tomatoes grown in heated greenhouses in cold climates produce MORE emissions than tomatoes imported from warmer countries where they grow naturally outdoors—even accounting for transport.

**Example 2: Lamb**
- New Zealand lamb exported to the UK has about **four times LESS** carbon emissions than lamb raised in the UK. Why? New Zealand's climate allows grass-fed farming with minimal inputs.

**Example 3: The full picture**
- Scientists estimate that ending ALL international food transport would only reduce food-system emissions by about 9%
- The biggest impact comes from **what** we eat, not just **where** it comes from

### What Actually Reduces Environmental Impact?

1. **Eat less beef and lamb** (these have the highest environmental footprint)
2. **Eat more plant-based foods** (legumes, vegetables, fruits, grains)
3. **Reduce food waste** (wasted food means wasted resources)
4. **Eat locally AND seasonally** (local tomatoes in summer are a win; local greenhouse tomatoes in winter might not be)

---

## The Environmental Footprint of Different Foods

Not all foods have the same environmental impact. Here's a comparison of greenhouse gas emissions:

| Food | Approximate kg CO₂ per kg food |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Beef | 36-100 |
| Lamb | 24-39 |
| Cheese | 12-24 |
| Pork | 12 |
| Chicken | 10 |
| Eggs | 4.5 |
| Tofu | 3.2 |
| Legumes | Under 2 |
| Vegetables | Under 1 |

**Key takeaway:** Beef produces about **6 times more greenhouse gases** than chicken per 50g of protein, and **up to 100 times more** than plant-based proteins like legumes.

### Water Use

Food production also uses enormous amounts of water:

| Food | Litres of water per kg produced |
|------|--------------------------------|
| Beef | 15,415 |
| Chicken | 4,325 |
| Vegetables | 322 |

This is why environmental organisations encourage "eating lower on the food chain"—choosing more plants and less meat.

---

## Food Waste: Australia's $36 Billion Problem

Australians waste a staggering amount of food:

- **7.6 million tonnes** of food wasted per year in Australia
- **312 kg** per person per year (that's almost 1 kg per day!)
- About **70%** of this could have been eaten
- Cost to the economy: **$36.6 billion per year**
- Cost to the average household: **$2,500-$3,800 per year** (about $50/week!)

### Where Does Food Waste Happen?

Households are actually the **biggest** source of food waste, responsible for about **32%** of all food waste in Australia (2.5 million tonnes per year).

**Most commonly wasted foods:**
1. Vegetables (29%)
2. Fruit (22%)
3. Leftovers and prepared meals
4. Bakery items (21%)
5. Dairy products
6. Meat

### Why Does Food Waste Matter for the Environment?

When food ends up in landfill, it doesn't just disappear. As it breaks down, it releases **methane**—a greenhouse gas that is **28 times more potent** than carbon dioxide.

About **92%** of household food waste in Australia still goes directly to landfill.

### How to Reduce Food Waste

**At home:**
- **Plan meals** and make a shopping list
- **Understand date labels** (remember: best-before = quality, use-by = safety)
- **Store food properly** to extend its life
- **Use leftovers** creatively
- **First in, first out:** Use older items before newer ones
- **Compost** what you can't eat

**Food rescue organisations** also play an important role:
- **Foodbank** delivers 92+ million meals per year
- **OzHarvest** rescues 441,500 meals per month
- **SecondBite** rescued 25.2 million kg of food in 2023

---

## Convenience Foods: The Trade-Offs

**Convenience foods** are commercially prepared foods designed for easy consumption and minimal preparation. They're a big part of modern life—but they come with trade-offs.

### Types of Convenience Foods

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Ready-to-eat | Pre-made sandwiches, sushi, salads |
| Ready-to-heat | Frozen meals, canned soups, microwave rice |
| Ready-to-cook | Meal kits, marinated meats, stir-fry mixes |

### Advantages

- Save time and effort
- Consistent quality and taste
- Extended shelf life
- Built-in portion control
- No cooking skills required
- Wide variety available
- Can be safer (commercially controlled processes)

### Disadvantages

- Often higher in salt, sugar, and saturated fat
- More packaging (environmental impact)
- Generally less nutritious than home-prepared equivalents
- May contain more additives
- Usually more expensive per serve
- May be ultra-processed

### Making Better Convenience Choices

Not all convenience foods are created equal! Some healthier options include:
- **Frozen vegetables and fruits:** Nutrients are preserved by flash-freezing
- **Canned legumes:** Ready-to-use protein, just rinse to reduce sodium
- **Plain Greek yoghurt:** High protein, minimal processing
- **Canned fish:** Convenient protein source
- **Microwavable brown rice:** Quick whole grain option
- **Pre-cut vegetables:** Saves preparation time without compromising nutrition

---

## Food Packaging and the Environment

Food packaging serves important purposes—it protects food, extends shelf life, provides required information, and prevents contamination. But it also creates enormous environmental problems.

### Australian Packaging Statistics

- 86% of all packaging **CAN** be recycled
- But only 56% is actually recycled
- **Plastic packaging recycling rate: only 19-20%**—the worst performer
- 84% of plastic waste goes to landfill
- 130,000 tonnes of plastic enters Australia's oceans each year

### Australia's 2025 National Packaging Targets

1. 100% of packaging to be reusable, recyclable, or compostable
2. 70% of plastic packaging being recycled or composted
3. 50% average recycled content in packaging
4. Phase out problematic single-use plastics

### What Can You Do?

Remember the hierarchy: **Reduce → Reuse → Recycle**

- **Reduce:** Buy products with less packaging; choose concentrated products; avoid single-serve packages
- **Reuse:** Choose reusable containers, bags, and bottles
- **Recycle:** Learn what can be recycled in your area; rinse containers; keep recycling uncontaminated

---

## Eating Seasonally in Australia

Eating **seasonal** produce means choosing fruits and vegetables that are naturally in season in your region. Seasonal produce is typically fresher, tastier, more nutritious, and has a lower environmental footprint.

**Summer (December–February)**
- Fruits: mangoes, berries, stone fruits (peaches, nectarines, plums), watermelon, cherries
- Vegetables: tomatoes, corn, zucchini, capsicum, cucumber, beans

**Autumn (March–May)**
- Fruits: apples, pears, figs, grapes, quinces
- Vegetables: pumpkin, mushrooms, broccoli, eggplant, sweet potato

**Winter (June–August)**
- Fruits: citrus (oranges, mandarins, lemons, grapefruit), kiwifruit
- Vegetables: cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, leafy greens, cabbage, silverbeet

**Spring (September–November)**
- Fruits: strawberries, pineapple, papaya
- Vegetables: asparagus, peas, artichokes, broad beans, spring onions

# Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

## Food Properties and Cooking Methods Summary

| Food Property | Recommended Methods | Why |
|---------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Tender meat** (fillet, chicken breast) | Grilling, frying, quick roasting | Doesn't need long cooking; preserves tenderness |
| **Tough meat** (brisket, shanks) | Braising, stewing, slow cooking | Needs time to convert collagen to gelatin |
| **Delicate** (fish, eggs) | Poaching, steaming, gentle baking | Gentle methods prevent overcooking and drying |
| **High starch** (potatoes, rice) | Boiling, steaming | Water needed for gelatinisation |
| **For browning** (anything you want crispy!) | Dry heat: roasting, grilling, frying | High, dry heat needed for Maillard reaction |
| **Nutrient preservation** | Steaming, microwaving, stir-frying | Minimal water contact and short cooking time |

---

## Key Temperatures to Remember

| Temperature | What Happens |
|-------------|--------------|
| 5°C | Top of safe refrigeration temperature |
| 5-60°C | **Danger zone** (bacteria multiply rapidly) |
| 62-65°C | Egg white coagulates |
| 65-70°C | Egg yolk coagulates |
| 70-82°C | Collagen converts to gelatin |
| 85-96°C | Simmering temperature |
| ~96°C | Starch fully gelatinises |
| 100°C | Water boils |
| 140°C+ | Maillard reaction begins |
| 160-180°C | Caramelisation occurs |

---

## Reading Labels: Quick Reference

**Use the per 100g column to compare products!**

| Nutrient | Low (good) | High (limit) |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Sugar | ≤5g per 100g | >15g per 100g |
| Sodium | <120mg per 100g | >400mg per 100g |
| Saturated fat | ≤1.5g per 100g | Higher amounts |
| Fibre | ≥3g per 100g is a good source | — |

**Date marking:**
- **Use-by** = Safety (don't eat after this date)
- **Best-before** = Quality (still safe after, but might not be at its best)

---

## Making Sustainable Food Choices

1. **Eat more plants, less meat** (especially beef and lamb)
2. **Reduce food waste** (plan meals, understand date labels, use leftovers)
3. **Choose seasonal produce** when possible
4. **Be thoughtful about packaging** (reduce, reuse, recycle)
5. **Cook at home more often** (generally healthier and less wasteful than convenience foods)

---

## Glossary of Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|

## Final Review Questions

1. A recipe tells you to "sear the meat to seal in the juices." Is this scientifically accurate? Explain what searing actually does.

2. You're making a cheese sauce and it turns out lumpy. Using your knowledge of gelatinisation, explain what probably went wrong and how to prevent it next time.

3. Compare these two breakfast cereals using only the Nutrition Information Panel:
   - Cereal A: 1,580kJ, 8.2g protein, 3.5g fat, 1.2g saturated fat, 62g carbs, 24g sugars, 380mg sodium per 100g
   - Cereal B: 1,510kJ, 11g protein, 6.2g fat, 0.8g saturated fat, 56g carbs, 3.8g sugars, 12mg sodium per 100g
   
   Which would be the healthier choice? Justify your answer.

4. Your grandmother stores bread in the fridge "to keep it fresh." Using your knowledge of starch retrogradation, explain why this might not be the best approach and suggest a better storage method.

5. You're designing a meal that needs to be both nutritious and environmentally sustainable. What food choices would you make and why?

6. A food label says "Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients" and shows a bar chart that's about 40% filled. What does this tell you about the product?

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:

BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.

TITLE: I can describe the scale of food waste in Australia and its environmental impact
CODE: 6.5

WHAT (concept explanation):
Australia wastes 7.6 million tonnes of food per year (312 kg per person). About 70% could have been eaten. Households are the biggest source at 32%. Food waste in landfill releases methane, which is 28 times more potent than CO2.

WHY (importance):
Understanding food waste helps you see why reducing it matters for both your budget and the environment.

EXAMPLE (concrete illustration):
The average Australian household wastes $2,500-$3,800 worth of food per year. The most commonly wasted foods are vegetables (29%), fruit (22%), and bakery items (21%). Understanding date labels alone could significantly reduce this waste.

SUBTOPIC: Contemporary Food Issues
SUBTOPIC CONTEXT: This subtopic explores current issues in food systems including ultra-processed foods, food miles, environmental impact, food waste, convenience foods, and packaging. You will learn to evaluate food choices for both health and sustainability.
SUBTOPIC RELEVANCE: Food choices affect not just personal health but also the environment and society. Understanding contemporary food issues helps you make informed decisions that consider the broader impacts of what you eat.

TOPIC: Food Specialisations
SUBJECT: Food Studies | YEAR LEVEL: Year 8
TOPIC DESCRIPTION: Analyse how characteristics and properties of food determine preparation techniques and presentation when creating solutions for healthy eating.

In this unit, you'll discover the science hiding in your kitchen. You'll learn why foods behave the way they do when you cook them, how to read food labels like a pro, and how to make choices that are good for both your health and the planet.

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to:
- Explain how the properties of food (like proteins and starches) change during cooking
- Choose the right cooking method for different foods
- Read and interpret Australian food labels
- Evaluate foods using sensory evaluation techniques
- Make informed decisions about healthy and sustainable eating

Let's get started!

# Chapter 1: Healthy Eating the Australian Way

## What Are the Australian Dietary Guidelines?

The Australian Dietary Guidelines are the official advice on what Australians should eat to stay healthy. They were developed by nutrition scientists and are updated as new research emerges. The current guidelines were published in 2013.

Here are the five key guidelines:

**Guideline 1:** To achieve and maintain a healthy weight, be physically active and choose amounts of nutritious food and drinks to meet your energy needs.

**Guideline 2:** Enjoy a wide variety of nutritious foods from the five food groups every day.

**Guideline 3:** Limit intake of foods containing saturated fat, added salt, added sugars and alcohol.

**Guideline 4:** Encourage, support and promote breastfeeding.

**Guideline 5:** Care for your food; prepare and store it safely.

---

## The Five Food Groups

The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating organises foods into five groups. Each group provides different nutrients your body needs.

### 1. Vegetables and Legumes/Beans 🥦

This group includes all vegetables—leafy greens, root vegetables, salad vegetables, and legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and kidney beans.

**Why you need them:** Vegetables provide fibre, vitamins (especially A, C, and folate), and minerals. They're low in energy (kilojoules) but high in nutrients—we call this being "nutrient-dense."

**One serve looks like:**
- ½ cup cooked vegetables (like broccoli, carrots, or peas)
- 1 cup raw salad vegetables
- ½ medium potato
- 1 medium tomato
- ½ cup cooked legumes

### 2. Fruit 🍎

Fresh, frozen, canned (in juice, not syrup), and dried fruits all count.

**Why you need them:** Fruit provides natural sugars for energy, plus fibre, vitamin C, and other antioxidants.

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 medium apple, banana, or orange
- 2 small plums or kiwi fruits
- 1 cup diced fresh fruit
- 30g dried fruit (about 4 dried apricots)

**Important:** Fruit juice is NOT the same as whole fruit. When fruit is juiced, the fibre is removed, and the natural sugars become more concentrated. Stick to whole fruit most of the time.

### 3. Grain (Cereal) Foods 🍞

This includes bread, rice, pasta, noodles, oats, breakfast cereals, and flour-based foods.

**Why you need them:** Grains provide carbohydrates (your body's main energy source), fibre, and B vitamins.

**Choose wholegrain:** Wholegrain foods contain the entire grain—the outer bran layer (fibre), the germ (nutrients), and the endosperm (energy). White bread and white rice have had the bran and germ removed, so they have less fibre and fewer nutrients.

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 slice of bread (40g)
- ½ cup cooked rice, pasta, or noodles
- ⅔ cup wheat cereal flakes
- ¼ cup muesli

### 4. Lean Meats, Poultry, Fish, Eggs, Tofu, Nuts, Seeds, and Legumes 🥩

This group provides protein and includes animal and plant sources.

**Why you need them:** Protein is essential for building and repairing muscles, skin, hair, and other tissues. This group also provides iron, zinc, and B12.

**One serve looks like:**
- 65g cooked lean red meat (about the size of your palm)
- 80g cooked chicken
- 100g cooked fish
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup cooked legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans)
- 170g tofu
- 30g nuts or seeds

**Did you notice?** Legumes appear in TWO food groups! They count as both a vegetable AND a protein source because they provide nutrients from both groups.

### 5. Milk, Yoghurt, Cheese and Alternatives 🧀

This includes dairy products and calcium-fortified alternatives like soy milk.

**Why you need them:** These foods are our main source of calcium, which is essential for building strong bones and teeth—especially important while you're still growing!

**One serve looks like:**
- 1 cup (250ml) milk
- 2 slices (40g) hard cheese
- ¾ cup (200g) yoghurt
- 1 cup calcium-fortified soy milk

## How Much Do You Need?

The amount of food you need depends on your age, sex, and how active you are. Here's a guide for students your age:

| Food Group | Girls 12-13 | Boys 12-13 | Girls 14-18 | Boys 14-18 |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Vegetables | 5 serves | 5½ serves | 5 serves | 5½ serves |
| Fruit | 2 serves | 2 serves | 2 serves | 2 serves |
| Grains | 5 serves | 6 serves | 7 serves | 7 serves |
| Protein foods | 2½ serves | 2½ serves | 2½ serves | 2½ serves |
| Dairy | 3½ serves | 3½ serves | 3½ serves | 3½ serves |

You also need plenty of water—about **1.4 to 1.9 litres per day**, which is roughly 6-8 glasses.

---

## What About Treats? Understanding Discretionary Foods

Discretionary foods are sometimes called "sometimes foods" or "extras." They're not necessary for good health, but they can add enjoyment to eating.

**What makes a food "discretionary"?**
- High in saturated fat, added sugars, or salt
- High in energy (kilojoules) but low in nutrients
- Not part of the five food groups

**Examples include:**
- Soft drinks and energy drinks
- Chips and savoury snacks
- Chocolate, lollies, and biscuits
- Cakes, pastries, and doughnuts
- Pies, sausage rolls, and hot chips
- Ice cream
- Processed meats like salami

**How much is okay?** The guidelines suggest limiting discretionary foods to a maximum of about **600 kilojoules per day**—that's roughly:
- 2 scoops of ice cream, OR
- ⅓ of a meat pie, OR
- A few squares of chocolate, OR
- 1 small packet of chips (30g), OR
- 2-3 sweet biscuits

That's not much! This is why it's important to fill up on nutritious foods from the five food groups first.

---

## Nutrient Density: Getting More Bang for Your Buck

**Nutrient density** is a way of measuring how many beneficial nutrients a food provides compared to its energy (kilojoule) content.

**High nutrient-dense foods** give you lots of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and protein for relatively few kilojoules. Think vegetables, fruits, lean meats, legumes, and whole grains.

**Low nutrient-dense foods** (sometimes called "empty calories") give you lots of energy but few beneficial nutrients. Think soft drinks, chips, and lollies.

**Here's a comparison:**

Imagine you have 500 kilojoules to "spend." You could choose:
- **An apple** (about 350kJ): gives you fibre, vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants
- **A handful of pretzels** (about 350kJ): gives you... mostly just refined carbohydrates

Both have similar energy, but the apple is much more nutrient-dense. When you're choosing foods, think: "What nutrients am I getting for these kilojoules?"

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. How many serves of vegetables should a 13-year-old girl eat each day?
2. What's the difference between a "use-by" date and "best-before" date on food labels? (We'll cover this in detail later!)
3. Name a food that belongs to TWO different food groups.
4. Why is whole fruit better than fruit juice?
5. What does "nutrient-dense" mean?

# Chapter 2: The Science of Cooking

Have you ever wondered what's actually happening inside your food when you cook it? Cooking isn't just about making food taste better or making it safe to eat—it's chemistry in action! Understanding the science helps you become a better cook and make smarter food choices.

---

## How Heat Changes Proteins: Denaturation and Coagulation

Proteins are found in eggs, meat, fish, dairy, and legumes. They're made up of long chains of amino acids, folded into complex 3D shapes—kind of like a tangled ball of string.

When you apply heat to proteins, two important things happen:

### Denaturation

**Denaturation** is when the protein's folded structure unravels. Think of it like unfolding a paper crane back into a flat sheet—the shape changes permanently.

Heat isn't the only thing that causes denaturation. Acids (like lemon juice or vinegar), salt, and even mechanical action (like whisking) can also denature proteins.

### Coagulation

Once proteins are denatured, they can bond together in new ways. This is called **coagulation**—the proteins join up to form a solid or semi-solid mass.

---

## Eggs: The Perfect Example

Eggs are the best way to see protein changes in action because they're almost pure protein (plus fat in the yolk).

**Raw egg white** is clear and runny because the proteins are dissolved in water, floating around separately.

**When you heat an egg white**, the proteins denature and then coagulate—they bond together into a network that traps water. This is why cooked egg white is:
- Opaque (white) instead of clear
- Firm instead of runny
- Cannot return to its raw state (the change is permanent)

### Key Temperatures for Eggs

| Part of Egg | Coagulation Temperature |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Egg white | 62-65°C |
| Egg yolk | 65-70°C |

This is why you can cook a fried egg with a firm white but a runny yolk—the white sets at a lower temperature than the yolk!

**Try this at home:** Boil three eggs for different times—3 minutes, 6 minutes, and 10 minutes. Cut them in half and observe the differences. The 3-minute egg will have a runny yolk, the 6-minute egg will have a jammy yolk, and the 10-minute egg will be fully set.

---

## What Happens When You Cook Meat?

Meat contains several types of proteins, and they all respond differently to heat.

### Muscle Fibres

At around **60°C**, muscle proteins start to denature and coagulate. The meat becomes firmer and changes colour—this is why raw meat is red but cooked meat turns grey or brown.

The red colour in raw meat comes from a protein called **myoglobin**. When heated, myoglobin denatures and oxidises, changing from red → pink → grey/brown.

### Why Overcooked Meat Is Tough and Dry

When you cook meat at high temperatures or for too long, the protein fibres contract tightly. Imagine wringing out a wet sponge—that's what's happening to the moisture in your meat. The proteins squeeze out the water, leaving you with tough, dry meat.

**The lesson:** Don't overcook your steak!

### Collagen: Turning Tough Cuts Tender

Some cuts of meat have lots of **collagen**—a tough connective tissue that holds muscles together. These are usually cheaper cuts from hard-working parts of the animal, like:
- Beef brisket (chest)
- Lamb shanks (legs)
- Pork shoulder
- Beef cheeks

If you quickly grill these cuts, they'll be impossibly tough and chewy. But here's the magic: when collagen is heated slowly at temperatures between **70-82°C** for a long time (2-4 hours), it transforms into **gelatin**—a soft, silky substance that makes meat "fall off the bone" tender.

This is the science behind slow-cooked stews and braised dishes. Low and slow = tender and delicious!

---

## How Heat Changes Starches: Gelatinisation

Starches are found in foods like flour, rice, pasta, potatoes, and corn. Understanding how starches behave when heated is essential for making sauces, gravies, and baked goods.

### What Is Gelatinisation?

**Gelatinisation** is what happens when you heat starch in liquid. Here's the process:

1. **Starting point:** Starch exists as tiny granules—microscopic packets of starch molecules.

2. **Around 60°C:** The granules start absorbing water and swelling, like tiny sponges.

3. **Around 85°C:** The granules have absorbed about 5 times their weight in water and are fully swollen.

4. **Around 96°C:** The granules burst open, releasing starch molecules into the liquid. These molecules tangle together, thickening the liquid.

5. **On cooling:** The mixture sets into a gel.

### Making a White Sauce (Béchamel)

Making a white sauce is the perfect demonstration of gelatinisation. Here's what's happening:

1. You make a **roux** by cooking butter and flour together. This coats the starch granules in fat.

2. You gradually add milk while stirring constantly.

3. As you heat the sauce, the starch granules absorb the milk and swell.

4. When the sauce reaches near-boiling (about 96°C), the granules burst and release their starch, thickening the sauce.

**Why do we stir constantly?** Stirring serves two purposes:
- It distributes heat evenly so all the starch granules gelatinise at the same rate
- It prevents lumps by separating granules as they swell

**Why do we add liquid gradually?** Adding liquid slowly allows each addition to be fully incorporated before more is added. If you dump all the liquid in at once, the starch granules clump together and you get lumps!

---

## Why Does Bread Go Stale?

Here's something that might surprise you: **bread goes stale faster in the fridge than at room temperature!**

This seems wrong—doesn't refrigeration preserve food? Yes, but staling isn't about spoilage; it's about a process called **retrogradation**.

### What Is Retrogradation?

When bread is baked, the starches gelatinise—they absorb water and swell, giving bread its soft, moist texture.

But over time, those gelatinised starch molecules slowly reorganise and recrystallise. As they do, they push water out. This makes bread firm, dry, and stale.

**The surprising part:** This process happens fastest at refrigerator temperatures (around 4°C)! At room temperature, bread stales more slowly. In the freezer, the process essentially stops.

**Life hack:** If your bread has gone stale, try toasting it! Heat temporarily reverses retrogradation, which is why toast can make stale bread taste fresh again.

**Best bread storage:**
- Eat within a few days: room temperature in a bread bin
- Longer storage: freeze it, then toast slices as needed

---

## The Maillard Reaction: The Science of Delicious Browning

Have you ever noticed that toast, seared steak, roasted coffee, and baked cookies all have something in common? They're all brown, and they all smell amazing. That's the **Maillard reaction** at work!

### What Is the Maillard Reaction?

The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between **amino acids** (from proteins) and **reducing sugars** (like glucose) that occurs when food is heated to high temperatures.

The reaction creates:
- Brown colour
- Hundreds of new flavour compounds
- Appealing aromas

It was named after French chemist Louis-Camille Maillard, who first described it in 1912.

### Key Requirements

The Maillard reaction needs:
- **High temperatures:** Above 140-165°C
- **Dry conditions:** This is important!

Water boils at 100°C. As long as there's water present, the temperature can't get high enough for the Maillard reaction. This is why:
- Boiled potatoes are pale, but roasted potatoes are golden brown
- Steamed chicken is white, but grilled chicken has brown grill marks
- Wet bread won't toast properly

**Try this:** Put a piece of damp bread in the toaster. It won't brown properly until all the water evaporates. Then browning starts rapidly!

### Maillard Reaction vs Caramelisation

These are two different browning reactions that are often confused:

| Feature | Maillard Reaction | Caramelisation |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| What's needed | Amino acids + sugars + heat | Sugars + heat only |
| Temperature | ~140°C and above | ~160-180°C (higher) |
| Flavour result | Complex, savoury, meaty, nutty | Sweet, butterscotch, toffee |
| Examples | Toast, seared meat, roasted coffee | Caramel sauce, crème brûlée |

**Caramelisation** is the browning of sugars alone—no proteins needed. It requires higher temperatures and produces a different (sweeter) flavour profile.

---

## Common Cooking Myth: "Searing Seals in Juices"

You might have heard that you should sear meat at high heat to "seal in the juices." This is one of the most persistent myths in cooking, but it's completely false!

Scientists have tested this by weighing steaks before and after cooking. They found that seared steaks actually **lose MORE moisture** than steaks cooked at lower temperatures.

So why do we sear meat? For the **Maillard reaction**! Searing creates that delicious brown crust, complex flavours, and appealing aroma. It doesn't seal in anything—it just makes meat taste amazing.

---

## Emulsification: Mixing the Unmixable

Oil and water don't mix—everyone knows that. If you pour oil into water, the oil floats on top in a separate layer. But what about mayonnaise? It's made from oil and vinegar (which is mostly water), yet it's a smooth, creamy mixture. How does that work?

### What Is an Emulsion?

An **emulsion** is a mixture of two liquids that normally don't mix, where one liquid is dispersed as tiny droplets throughout the other.

**Types of emulsions:**
- **Oil-in-water (O/W):** Oil droplets dispersed in water. Examples: mayonnaise, milk, salad dressings
- **Water-in-oil (W/O):** Water droplets dispersed in oil. Examples: butter, margarine

### The Role of Emulsifiers

An **emulsifier** is a substance that helps hold emulsions together. Emulsifiers work because they have two different ends:
- A **hydrophilic** (water-loving) end that bonds with water
- A **hydrophobic** (water-fearing) end that bonds with oil

The emulsifier positions itself at the boundary between oil and water droplets, creating a protective coating around each droplet and preventing them from joining back together.

### Lecithin: Nature's Emulsifier

**Lecithin** is a natural emulsifier found in egg yolks (about 1.2% of the yolk). This is why egg yolks are used to make mayonnaise, hollandaise sauce, and other emulsified sauces.

### Making Mayonnaise: Emulsion in Action

Traditional mayonnaise contains:
- Oil (70-80%)
- Egg yolk (the emulsifier)
- Vinegar or lemon juice (acid)
- Salt and seasonings

**The technique is crucial:**
1. Start with egg yolk and whisk in a small amount of acid
2. Add oil **very slowly**—just drops at first—while whisking vigorously
3. The lecithin in the egg yolk coats each tiny oil droplet before more oil is added
4. Gradually you can add oil faster as the emulsion stabilises

**Why emulsions "split":**
- Adding oil too quickly (droplets don't get coated before more are added)
- Not enough emulsifier (egg yolk)
- Temperature extremes (too cold or too hot)
- Wrong proportions

If your mayonnaise splits (separates into oily and watery layers), you can often rescue it by starting with a fresh egg yolk and slowly whisking the broken mayonnaise into it.

## How Acids Affect Food

Acids—like lemon juice, vinegar, lime juice, and wine—are powerful ingredients in cooking. Here's what they do:

### Tenderising Meat with Marinades

Remember how heat denatures proteins? Acids do the same thing! When you marinate meat in an acidic liquid, the acid denatures the proteins on the surface, making the meat more tender.

**But be careful:** If you marinate meat for too long, the acid will denature proteins too much, making the meat mushy and unpleasant. For most meats, **30 minutes to 2 hours** is enough.

### Preventing Browning

When you cut an apple, the cut surface turns brown within minutes. This is called **enzymatic browning**, and here's what's happening:

1. Cutting damages the apple's cells
2. An enzyme called **polyphenol oxidase (PPO)** is released
3. PPO reacts with oxygen in the air
4. Brown pigments are produced

**How lemon juice prevents browning:**
- **The acid denatures the enzyme:** PPO works best at pH 5-7, but lemon juice has a pH of about 2. At this low pH, the enzyme can't function.
- **Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant:** The vitamin C in lemon juice reacts with oxygen before PPO can, using up the oxygen needed for browning.

**Practical application:** When preparing apple slices for a lunch box or fruit platter, toss them in a little lemon juice to keep them looking fresh!

### Acids in Baking

Have you noticed that many recipes call for buttermilk and baking soda together? Here's why:

Buttermilk contains **lactic acid**. Baking soda is a **base** (sodium bicarbonate). When acid and base combine, they react and produce **carbon dioxide gas**.

Those CO₂ bubbles get trapped in the batter and make it rise—creating fluffy pancakes, tender scones, and light cakes.

**Important:** This reaction happens immediately when the ingredients combine, which is why recipes tell you to mix wet and dry ingredients separately, then combine them just before baking. If you let the batter sit too long, the bubbles escape before baking!

# Chapter 3: Cooking Methods

Choosing the right cooking method is one of the most important decisions you'll make in the kitchen. The properties of your ingredients—how much fat they contain, how tough or tender they are, how delicate their texture is—should guide your choice.

---

## Wet (Moist Heat) Cooking Methods

These methods use water or other liquids as the cooking medium. They're generally gentler and can't produce browning (because water limits the temperature to 100°C).

### Boiling (100°C)

**What it looks like:** Large bubbles rapidly breaking the surface—a "rolling boil."

**Best for:** Pasta, rice, potatoes, hard vegetables, eggs

**Advantages:** Fast cooking, kills bacteria effectively

**Disadvantages:** Can break up delicate foods, causes nutrients to leach into the water (especially water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C)

**Tip:** Don't throw out the cooking water from vegetables—use it in soups, gravies, or sauces to recapture some of those nutrients!

### Simmering (85-96°C)

**What it looks like:** Gentle bubbles rising to the surface, but not a full rolling boil.

**Best for:** Soups, stews, stocks, rice, sauces, tough cuts of meat

**Advantages:** Gentler than boiling, tenderises tough cuts, develops flavours over time

**Why not boil meat?** Boiling meat at 100°C causes proteins to contract rapidly, squeezing out moisture and making meat tough. Simmering is gentler.

### Poaching (70-85°C)

**What it looks like:** Very gentle—barely any bubbles at all. The surface just shimmers.

**Best for:** Eggs, fish, chicken breast, delicate fruit (like pears)

**Advantages:** Extremely gentle cooking perfect for delicate foods, no added fat, maintains moisture

**Example:** Poached eggs cook perfectly at this low temperature—the white sets gently while the yolk stays runny.

### Steaming (100°C+)

**What it looks like:** Food sits on a rack or in a basket above boiling water, never touching the water itself.

**Best for:** Vegetables, fish, dumplings, dim sum

**Advantages:** 
- **Retains the most nutrients** of any cooking method (vitamins don't leach into water)
- No added fat
- Preserves bright colours
- Gentle cooking

**Why steaming retains more nutrients:** Water-soluble vitamins (like vitamin C and B vitamins) dissolve into cooking water when you boil vegetables. Since steamed food never touches water, these vitamins stay in the food.

### Braising (135-165°C, combination method)

**What it looks like:** Food is first seared at high heat, then slow-cooked partially covered in liquid in the oven.

**Best for:** Tough cuts of meat (brisket, shanks, osso buco), root vegetables

**How it works:**
1. **Sear** the meat first at high heat (Maillard reaction = flavour!)
2. Add aromatics (onions, garlic, herbs) and liquid (stock, wine, tomatoes)
3. Cover and cook slowly in the oven at 135-165°C for 2-4 hours
4. The long, slow cooking converts **collagen to gelatin**, making tough meat incredibly tender

**Examples:** Beef bourguignon, lamb shanks, osso buco, pulled pork

---

## Dry Heat Cooking Methods

These methods use hot air, hot fat, or direct heat—no water involved. Because there's no water to limit the temperature, these methods can reach the high temperatures needed for browning.

### Baking (150-200°C)

**What it looks like:** Enclosed oven, hot air circulates around the food.

**Best for:** Bread, cakes, pastries, casseroles, fish

**Advantages:** Even cooking, creates golden crusts, hands-off cooking

### Roasting (180-230°C)

**What it looks like:** Similar to baking but typically at higher temperatures.

**Best for:** Large cuts of meat, whole chickens, vegetables

**What's happening:** The high heat creates a caramelised, crispy exterior through Maillard reaction and caramelisation, while the inside cooks through more slowly.

**Tip for roasting vegetables:** Cut them into similar-sized pieces so they cook evenly, toss with oil, spread in a single layer (not crowded), and roast at high heat until caramelised.

### Grilling (Very High Direct Heat)

**What it looks like:** Heat comes from below (barbecue) or above (grill element), cooking by direct radiant heat.

**Best for:** Steaks, chops, burgers, sausages, vegetables, kebabs

**Advantages:** 
- Creates char marks and smoky flavour
- Fat drips away from the food
- Quick cooking
- No added fat needed

**Best for tender cuts:** Grilling is a fast, high-heat method. It works best for tender cuts that don't need long cooking—like sirloin steak, lamb cutlets, or chicken breast.

### Shallow Frying (160-180°C)

**What it looks like:** Oil covers about half the food; you need to turn the food to cook both sides.

**Best for:** Eggs, fish fillets, schnitzel, pancakes, hash browns

**The key:** Oil must be hot enough that food sizzles immediately when added. If the oil isn't hot enough, food absorbs more oil and becomes greasy.

### Deep Frying (160-190°C)

**What it looks like:** Food is completely submerged in hot oil.

**Best for:** Chips, battered fish, doughnuts, spring rolls, fried chicken

**What's happening:** The hot oil rapidly heats the surface of the food, creating a crispy crust through the Maillard reaction. The interior steams from the inside out.

**Safety warning:** Hot oil is extremely dangerous! Never leave a deep fryer unattended, never fill it more than half full, and never add wet food to hot oil (it will splatter violently).

---

## Matching Cooking Methods to Food Properties

Understanding **why** certain foods suit certain methods is the key to becoming a skilled cook.

### Tender vs Tough Cuts of Meat

| Cut Type | Examples | Properties | Best Methods |
|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Tender** | Fillet steak, sirloin, chicken breast, pork loin | Little connective tissue, naturally tender | Grilling, frying, quick roasting |
| **Tough** | Beef brisket, lamb shank, pork shoulder, chuck | Lots of connective tissue (collagen) | Braising, stewing, slow cooking |

**Why:** Tender cuts are already soft, so quick, high-heat cooking preserves their texture. Tough cuts need long, slow cooking to convert their collagen into gelatin.

**What happens if you get it wrong:**
- Grill a lamb shank → tough, chewy, inedible
- Braise a fillet steak → mushy, overcooked, flavourless

### Delicate Foods

Delicate foods—like fish fillets, eggs, and chicken breast—have properties that require gentle handling:
- **Fish** flakes apart easily and dries out quickly
- **Eggs** have proteins that set rapidly
- **Chicken breast** is low in fat, so it dries out easily

**Best methods for delicate foods:** Poaching, steaming, gentle baking, or quick pan-frying. Avoid high, dry heat that will dry them out.

### Why You Wouldn't...

- **Boil a steak:** It would turn grey (no Maillard browning), become tough (proteins contract rapidly), and lose flavour to the water.

- **Deep-fry custard:** It would fall apart completely and might even explode from the water content turning to steam!

- **Grill a delicate fish on a barbecue without foil:** It would stick to the grates, fall apart, and dry out before it's cooked through.

- **Roast leafy greens:** They would burn and become bitter within minutes.

---

## Nutrient Retention: Which Methods Are Best?

Different cooking methods affect nutrient content in different ways. This matters most for **water-soluble vitamins** (vitamin C and B vitamins) which are sensitive to heat and can dissolve into cooking water.

**Cooking methods ranked for nutrient retention (best to worst):**

1. **Steaming** ⭐ Best—no contact with water, short cooking time
2. **Microwaving**—quick cooking, minimal water needed
3. **Stir-frying**—short cooking time, no water
4. **Roasting/baking**—dry heat preserves fat-soluble vitamins
5. **Boiling** ⚠️ Worst—vitamins leach into water, longer cooking times

**Tips for preserving nutrients:**
- Cook vegetables for the shortest time possible
- Use the smallest amount of water necessary
- Cut vegetables into larger pieces (less surface area = less nutrient loss)
- Don't throw away cooking water—use it in soups or sauces

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. What's the difference between simmering and boiling?
2. Why is steaming the best cooking method for preserving nutrients?
3. Which cooking method would you use for a tough beef brisket? Explain why.
4. Why can't wet cooking methods create browning on food?
5. What's the difference between baking and roasting?

# Chapter 4: Reading Food Labels

Food labels are like a window into what you're really eating. Learning to read them helps you make informed choices about your food. In Australia, food labelling is regulated by **Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ)**, which sets strict rules about what must appear on food packages.

---

## What Must Appear on Australian Food Labels?

Most packaged foods in Australia must display:

1. **Food name/description**
2. **Ingredient list**
3. **Date marking** (use-by or best-before)
4. **Nutrition Information Panel (NIP)**
5. **Allergen declarations**
6. **Name and address** of the manufacturer or supplier
7. **Country of origin**
8. **Lot identification** (for tracing purposes)
9. **Directions for use/storage** (where needed for safety)
10. **Warning statements** (where required)
11. **Net weight or volume**

**What's exempt?** Some foods don't need full labelling, including:
- Foods made and sold on the same premises (like at a bakery or deli counter)
- Unpackaged foods
- Very small packages (under 100cm²)
- Some single-ingredient foods

---

## Understanding the Nutrition Information Panel (NIP)

The Nutrition Information Panel is your most valuable tool for comparing foods. Here's what you'll find:

### Mandatory Information

Every NIP must include:
- **Energy** (in kilojoules, kJ)
- **Protein** (in grams)
- **Fat, total** (in grams)
- **Saturated fat** (in grams)
- **Carbohydrate** (in grams)
- **Sugars** (in grams)
- **Sodium** (in milligrams)

### Per Serve vs Per 100g: Why Both Matter

You'll notice the NIP has two columns: "Per Serve" and "Per 100g" (or per 100ml for liquids).

**Per serve** tells you what you'll consume in one suggested serving. This is useful for tracking your actual intake.

**BUT BEWARE:** Manufacturers decide what a "serving" is, and they often use small serving sizes to make the numbers look better! A packet of chips might list a serving as 25g, but most people eat the whole 50g packet.

**Per 100g** is the standardised measure that allows you to **fairly compare** different products. It's the same amount across all products, so it's the best way to compare which muesli bar is lower in sugar or which bread is higher in fibre.

**Golden rule:** Always use the "per 100g" column when comparing products!

### What Do the Numbers Mean?

Here's a guide to interpreting nutrient levels:

| Nutrient | Low (good) | High (limit) |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Sugar** | ≤5g per 100g | >15g per 100g |
| **Sodium** | <120mg per 100g | >400mg per 100g |
| **Saturated fat** | ≤1.5g per 100g | Higher amounts |
| **Fibre** | ≥3g per 100g is a good source | — |

**Example comparison:**

| Breakfast Cereal | Sugar per 100g | Verdict |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Cereal A | 3.2g | Low sugar ✓ |
| Cereal B | 22g | High sugar ✗ |
| Cereal C | 12g | Medium |

---

## Decoding the Ingredient List

The ingredient list tells you exactly what's in the food, listed in **descending order by weight**. The first ingredient is what the product contains most of, and the last is what it contains least of.

**What to look for:**
- If sugar, fat, or salt appears in the first few ingredients, the product contains a lot of it
- Watch for sugar's many names: sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, agave, rice malt syrup—they're all added sugars!
- Numbers like (102) or (621) refer to food additives

**Example ingredient list:**
> Wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil, cocoa powder (5%), glucose syrup, salt, raising agents (500, 501), emulsifier (soy lecithin), flavour.

This product has sugar as the second ingredient and glucose syrup as the fifth—that's two types of sugar high on the list. The (5%) next to cocoa powder tells you exactly how much is in there.

---

## Understanding Allergen Declarations

Food allergies can be life-threatening, so Australian food law requires allergens to be clearly declared.

### The Mandatory Allergens (as of 2024)

These allergens MUST be declared in Australia:
- Peanuts
- Tree nuts (the specific type must be named, e.g., "almonds," "cashews")
- Milk
- Eggs
- Sesame seeds
- Fish (the type must be named)
- Crustaceans (the type must be named, e.g., "prawns")
- Molluscs (the type must be named, e.g., "oysters")
- Soy/soya
- Cereals containing gluten (wheat, barley, rye, oats)
- Lupin
- Sulphites (if 10mg/kg or more)

### How Allergens Are Displayed

Allergens must be:
1. Highlighted in **bold** within the ingredient list
2. Listed in a separate "**Contains:**" statement in the same area as the ingredients

**Example:**
> Ingredients: Wheat flour, **milk**, sugar, **egg**, vegetable oil, **almonds**, salt.
> 
> **Contains: Wheat (gluten), milk, egg, tree nuts (almonds).**

### "May Contain" Statements

You might see statements like "May contain traces of peanuts." These are **voluntary**—companies use them to warn that a product might have been accidentally contaminated during manufacturing (for example, if peanut products are made on the same equipment).

These statements aren't regulated by law, so different companies use them differently. People with allergies need to decide their own comfort level with "may contain" warnings.

---

## Date Marking: Use-By vs Best-Before

This is one of the most misunderstood parts of food labelling!

### Use-By Date

**"Use by [date]"**

This is about **FOOD SAFETY**. Foods with a use-by date may become unsafe after this date, even if they look and smell fine.

**Important rules:**
- It's **illegal** to sell food after its use-by date
- You should **not eat** food after the use-by date
- Used for foods that might become dangerous, like fresh meat, dairy, and ready-to-eat salads

### Best-Before Date

**"Best before [date]"**

This is about **FOOD QUALITY**. The food is still safe to eat after this date, but it might not be at its best—it could be stale, have less flavour, or changed texture.

**Important rules:**
- It **is legal** to sell food after its best-before date (as long as it's not damaged or deteriorated)
- You **can eat** food after the best-before date if it looks and smells okay
- Used for foods like canned goods, cereals, biscuits, and snack foods

### Special Cases

- **Bread:** Products with a shelf life under 7 days can use "baked on" or "baked for" instead
- **Long-life foods:** Products with a shelf life of 2 years or more (like some canned foods) don't need date marking

**Don't waste food unnecessarily!** Understanding this difference helps reduce food waste. That can of beans two months past its best-before date? Probably still perfectly good. That chicken one day past its use-by date? Not worth the risk.

---

## Health Star Rating System

The **Health Star Rating** is a voluntary front-of-pack label that rates a food's overall nutritional profile from ½ star to 5 stars. More stars = healthier choice.

### How It Works

The rating is calculated by looking at:
- **Risk-increasing nutrients:** Energy, saturated fat, total sugars, sodium (these subtract points)
- **Risk-decreasing nutrients:** Protein, fibre, fruit/vegetable/nut/legume content (these add points)

### How to Use Health Stars

✅ **Do:** Compare similar products (two yoghurts, two breakfast cereals, two pasta sauces)

❌ **Don't:** Compare across categories (chips to bread, biscuits to vegetables)

❌ **Don't:** Assume a higher rating means a food is "healthy"—compare to similar products only

### Limitations

- **It's voluntary:** Only about 35% of eligible products display Health Star Ratings. Companies might only show them on their higher-scoring products.
- **It doesn't consider processing:** A highly processed food could still score reasonably well
- **Fresh produce:** Fresh fruit and vegetables automatically get 5 stars—they don't need the label!

---

## Country of Origin Labelling

Australian food labels must tell you where the food comes from. Look for the kangaroo-in-a-triangle logo and the bar chart.

### Understanding the Claims

| Claim | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Grown in Australia** | All significant ingredients grown in Australia |
| **Product of Australia** | All ingredients AND virtually all processing done in Australia |
| **Made in Australia** | Product underwent its "last substantial transformation" in Australia (but ingredients may be imported) |
| **Packed in Australia** | Only packaged here; ingredients from elsewhere |

### The Bar Chart

The bar chart shows the percentage of Australian ingredients, filled in 10% increments.

For example:
- A full bar (100%) means all ingredients are Australian
- A half-filled bar (50%) means about half the ingredients are Australian
- An empty bar means minimal Australian ingredients

**Note:** Only products that are grown, produced, or made in Australia can use the kangaroo logo.

---

## Nutrition and Health Claims

You'll often see claims on food packaging like "low fat" or "high in fibre." These claims are regulated—they can only be used if the product meets specific criteria.

### Nutrition Content Claims

These describe the nutrient content:

| Claim | What It Must Mean |
|-------|-------------------|
| Low fat | ≤3g per 100g (solid foods) |
| Fat free | ≤0.15g per 100g |
| Reduced fat | ≥25% less fat than the regular version |
| Low sugar | ≤5g per 100g (solid foods) |
| No added sugar | No sugar added (but may contain natural sugars) |
| Low sodium/salt | ≤120mg sodium per 100g |
| Good source of fibre | ≥4g fibre per serve |

### Watch Out For...

**"Reduced fat" doesn't mean "low fat."** A product only needs to have 25% less fat than its regular version. If the original had 40g fat per 100g, the "reduced fat" version could still have 30g—that's still high!

**"No added sugar" doesn't mean "no sugar."** A product can be naturally high in sugar (like fruit juice) and still claim "no added sugar."

**"Light" or "Lite" can mean anything.** These terms might refer to colour, taste, or texture—not necessarily fewer kilojoules. Always check the NIP.

**"Natural" is not a regulated term.** Any product can claim to be "natural"—it doesn't guarantee anything about health or quality.

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. Why should you use "per 100g" rather than "per serve" when comparing products?
2. What's the difference between a use-by date and a best-before date?
3. A product is labelled "Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients." What does this tell you?
4. A breakfast cereal contains 12g of sugar per 100g. Is this low, medium, or high?
5. If peanut oil is used in a product, how must it be displayed on the label?

---

# Chapter 5: Sensory Evaluation

When food scientists develop new products or chefs perfect recipes, they don't just rely on their own opinions. They use systematic **sensory evaluation** methods to objectively assess food. Understanding these techniques will help you evaluate food more critically and communicate about food more effectively.

---

## The Five Basic Tastes

Humans can detect five basic taste sensations. Each one serves an evolutionary purpose—helping our ancestors identify nutritious foods and avoid dangerous ones.

### Sweet

**What causes it:** Sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose) and some artificial sweeteners

**Examples:** Honey, ripe fruit, chocolate, lollies, sweet potato

**Purpose:** Signals energy-rich foods (carbohydrates)

### Sour

**What causes it:** Acids, including citric acid, acetic acid (vinegar), and lactic acid (yoghurt)

**Examples:** Lemons, vinegar, sour cream, green apples, sourdough bread

**Purpose:** Helps detect unripe fruit or potentially spoiled food

### Salty

**What causes it:** Sodium chloride (table salt) and other mineral salts

**Examples:** Chips, soy sauce, cheese, cured meats, seaweed

**Purpose:** Indicates sodium, which is essential for body functions

### Bitter

**What causes it:** Many different compounds (there are about 35 different bitter taste receptors!)

**Examples:** Coffee, dark chocolate, Brussels sprouts, grapefruit pith, some leafy greens

**Purpose:** Originally served as a warning against toxic plants (many poisons taste bitter)

### Umami

**What causes it:** Glutamate (an amino acid) and certain nucleotides

**Examples:** Parmesan cheese, ripe tomatoes, mushrooms, soy sauce, Vegemite, miso, aged meats

**Discovered:** Japanese scientist Dr. Kikunae Ikeda identified umami in 1908. The name means "pleasant savoury taste" or "deliciousness" in Japanese.

**Purpose:** Indicates protein-rich foods

---

## The Tongue Map Myth

You may have seen diagrams showing different parts of the tongue tasting different things—sweet at the tip, bitter at the back, and so on. 

**This is completely wrong!**

The "tongue map" was based on a misinterpretation of research from the 1800s. Scientists have since proven that taste receptors for all five tastes are distributed across the **entire tongue**. You can taste sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami anywhere on your tongue.

**Try it yourself:** Put a little salt on the very tip of your tongue. You'll taste it immediately—proving that saltiness isn't restricted to the sides of your tongue!

---

## Taste Interactions

Tastes don't exist in isolation—they interact with each other in interesting ways:

- **Salt enhances sweetness** (this is why salted caramel works!)
- **Salt reduces bitterness** (try a tiny bit of salt on grapefruit)
- **Sweet and sour balance each other** (sweet and sour sauce, lemonade)
- **Umami can reduce the need for salt** (adding Parmesan to pasta means you need less salt)
- **Sweet masks bitterness** (sugar in coffee)

Understanding these interactions helps cooks balance flavours in dishes.

---

## Beyond Taste: The Multi-Sensory Experience

When we talk about how food "tastes," we're actually talking about much more than just our taste buds. Our perception of food involves all our senses working together.

### Smell (Olfaction)

Here's something surprising: **approximately 80% of what we perceive as "taste" actually comes from smell!**

Think about the last time you had a cold and couldn't smell anything. Food probably seemed bland and flavourless, right? That's because the complex flavours we enjoy come largely from volatile aroma compounds.

There are two ways smell contributes to eating:
- **Orthonasal:** Smelling through your nostrils before you eat (the aroma of fresh bread)
- **Retronasal:** Aromas travelling from your mouth to your nose while you eat (the full flavour experience)

### Sight

"We eat with our eyes first." Before we even taste food, we've already judged it based on how it looks.

Visual cues include:
- **Colour:** Bright, vibrant colours suggest freshness; brown or grey suggests staleness
- **Presentation:** Well-arranged food appears more appetising
- **Portion size:** Affects expectations

**Example:** Studies have shown that people rate orange juice as tasting more "orangey" when it's a deeper orange colour—even if the actual flavour is identical!

### Touch/Texture

Our mouth has very sensitive touch receptors. Texture contributes enormously to food enjoyment—think about the difference between a crispy chip and a soggy one!

Temperature is also detected through touch and dramatically affects our perception of food.

### Sound

The sounds food makes—crunch, crackle, sizzle—contribute to our perception of freshness and quality. A crisp apple that makes a satisfying crunch seems fresher than a soft one that doesn't.

---

## Texture: The Vocabulary

Being able to describe food texture precisely is an important skill. Here are some common texture descriptors:

| Term | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Crispy** | Light, thin, shatters easily with a high-pitched sound | Potato chips, crackers, fried chicken skin |
| **Crunchy** | Firm, requires force to bite through, makes a cracking sound | Raw carrot, apple, granola |
| **Chewy** | Requires prolonged chewing | Toffee, dried fruit, crusty bread |
| **Tender** | Easy to cut or bite through | Well-cooked steak, ripe pear |
| **Tough** | Difficult to bite or chew | Overcooked meat, stale bread |
| **Smooth** | No graininess or lumps | Custard, puréed soup |
| **Creamy** | Rich, smooth, coats the mouth | Ice cream, butter, mayonnaise |
| **Flaky** | Breaks into thin layers | Croissant, baked fish, puff pastry |
| **Crumbly** | Falls apart easily into small pieces | Shortbread, feta cheese |
| **Moist** | Contains noticeable moisture | Fresh cake, ripe watermelon |
| **Dry** | Lacks moisture | Crackers, overcooked chicken |
| **Juicy** | Releases liquid when bitten | Orange segments, medium-rare steak |

### Texture Contrast

Great dishes often include **texture contrast**—combining different textures makes eating more interesting and stimulating. Think about:
- Croutons (crunchy) in smooth soup
- Nuts (crunchy) in creamy ice cream
- Crispy bacon on creamy pasta
- Crunchy granola on smooth yoghurt

---

## Sensory Evaluation Methods

Food scientists use structured tests to evaluate food objectively. Here are some methods you might use in class:

### Triangle Test (Discrimination Test)

**Purpose:** To determine if people can detect a difference between two products.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive three samples—two identical, one different
2. Samples are labelled with random 3-digit codes (like 472, 815, 293)
3. Tasters must identify the "odd one out"

**The maths:** The chance of guessing correctly by accident is 1 in 3 (33%). If significantly more than 33% of tasters get it right, there's a real detectable difference.

**Example use:** A food company changes their recipe to use less salt. Before launching the new version, they run a triangle test to see if consumers can actually taste the difference.

### Ranking Test

**Purpose:** To order several samples by intensity of a characteristic.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive several samples (usually 3-6)
2. Each sample is coded with random numbers
3. Tasters arrange them in order (e.g., "sweetest to least sweet" or "crunchiest to softest")

**Example use:** Comparing five different apple varieties to rank them from sweetest to sourest.

### Hedonic Test (Preference Test)

**Purpose:** To measure how much people like a product.

**How it works:**
1. Tasters receive samples
2. They rate each sample on a 9-point scale:
   - 1 = Dislike extremely
   - 5 = Neither like nor dislike
   - 9 = Like extremely
3. Results are averaged to get an overall acceptance score

**Example use:** A café wants to know which of three new smoothie recipes customers prefer.

---

## Setting Up Fair Sensory Tests

For sensory tests to give reliable results, they must be conducted carefully. Here are the key principles:

### Eliminate Bias

- **Use blind testing:** Samples should be coded with random 3-digit numbers, not "Sample A" or "new recipe" vs "old recipe"
- **Randomise order:** Each taster should receive samples in a different random order
- **No talking:** Tasters shouldn't discuss samples during testing—they might influence each other

### Control Variables

- **Same temperature:** Serve all samples at the same temperature
- **Same quantity:** Give the same amount of each sample
- **Same containers:** Use identical serving vessels

### Cleanse the Palate

- **Between samples:** Provide plain water and/or plain crackers
- **Wait time:** Allow 30 seconds between samples
- **No strong flavours beforehand:** Tasters shouldn't have just eaten or drunk strongly flavoured items

### Record Results

- **Record immediately:** Tasters should write down their responses right after tasting each sample
- **Don't change answers:** Once recorded, answers shouldn't be changed

---

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

1. What are the five basic taste sensations?
2. What does "umami" mean, and what foods contain it?
3. Why is the "tongue map" a myth?
4. Approximately what percentage of flavour perception comes from smell?

## Ultra-Processed Foods: What Are They?

You've probably heard that you should eat less "processed food," but what does that actually mean? Scientists use a classification system called **NOVA** to categorise foods by how processed they are.

### The NOVA Classification

**Group 1: Unprocessed or Minimally Processed Foods**

These are foods in their natural state or with minimal changes (like cleaning, cutting, or freezing).

*Examples:* Fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, plain milk, raw meat, fish, nuts, plain rice

**Group 2: Processed Culinary Ingredients**

These are substances extracted from Group 1 foods, used for cooking.

*Examples:* Olive oil, butter, sugar, salt, honey, flour

**Group 3: Processed Foods**

These are made by combining Groups 1 and 2 using traditional methods like canning, bottling, or simple cooking.

*Examples:* Canned vegetables, cheese, bread, canned fish, salted nuts

**Group 4: Ultra-Processed Foods**

These are industrial formulations with many ingredients, including additives you wouldn't find in a home kitchen.

*Examples:* Soft drinks, chips, instant noodles, packaged snacks, chicken nuggets, mass-produced cakes, many breakfast cereals

### How to Spot Ultra-Processed Foods

Look at the ingredient list. Ultra-processed foods typically have:
- **Long ingredient lists** (often 5+ ingredients)
- **Ingredients you wouldn't use at home**, like:
  - High-fructose corn syrup
  - Hydrogenated oils
  - Protein isolates
  - Maltodextrin
- **Cosmetic additives** to improve appearance, texture, or flavour:
  - Colours (e.g., 102, 110)
  - Flavours
  - Emulsifiers
  - Thickeners

### Why Does It Matter?

Research links high consumption of ultra-processed foods to increased risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. These foods are designed to be hyper-palatable (extremely tasty and hard to stop eating) and convenient.

**Australian statistics:**
- About **42%** of the total energy in a typical Australian diet comes from ultra-processed foods
- **60%** of packaged foods in Australian supermarkets are classified as ultra-processed

## Food Miles and Environmental Impact

**Food miles** measure the distance food travels from where it's produced to where it's consumed. It seems logical that food travelling shorter distances would be better for the environment, but the reality is more complicated.

### The Case FOR Considering Food Miles

- Supports local farmers and local economies
- Food often arrives fresher
- Generally requires less packaging
- Reduces transport emissions

### But It's Not That Simple...

Here's where it gets interesting: **how food is produced often matters more than how far it travels.**

Consider these examples:

**Example 1: Tomatoes**
- Tomatoes grown in heated greenhouses in cold climates produce MORE emissions than tomatoes imported from warmer countries where they grow naturally outdoors—even accounting for transport.

**Example 2: Lamb**
- New Zealand lamb exported to the UK has about **four times LESS** carbon emissions than lamb raised in the UK. Why? New Zealand's climate allows grass-fed farming with minimal inputs.

**Example 3: The full picture**
- Scientists estimate that ending ALL international food transport would only reduce food-system emissions by about 9%
- The biggest impact comes from **what** we eat, not just **where** it comes from

### What Actually Reduces Environmental Impact?

1. **Eat less beef and lamb** (these have the highest environmental footprint)
2. **Eat more plant-based foods** (legumes, vegetables, fruits, grains)
3. **Reduce food waste** (wasted food means wasted resources)
4. **Eat locally AND seasonally** (local tomatoes in summer are a win; local greenhouse tomatoes in winter might not be)

---

## The Environmental Footprint of Different Foods

Not all foods have the same environmental impact. Here's a comparison of greenhouse gas emissions:

| Food | Approximate kg CO₂ per kg food |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Beef | 36-100 |
| Lamb | 24-39 |
| Cheese | 12-24 |
| Pork | 12 |
| Chicken | 10 |
| Eggs | 4.5 |
| Tofu | 3.2 |
| Legumes | Under 2 |
| Vegetables | Under 1 |

**Key takeaway:** Beef produces about **6 times more greenhouse gases** than chicken per 50g of protein, and **up to 100 times more** than plant-based proteins like legumes.

### Water Use

Food production also uses enormous amounts of water:

| Food | Litres of water per kg produced |
|------|--------------------------------|
| Beef | 15,415 |
| Chicken | 4,325 |
| Vegetables | 322 |

This is why environmental organisations encourage "eating lower on the food chain"—choosing more plants and less meat.

## Food Waste: Australia's $36 Billion Problem

Australians waste a staggering amount of food:

- **7.6 million tonnes** of food wasted per year in Australia
- **312 kg** per person per year (that's almost 1 kg per day!)
- About **70%** of this could have been eaten
- Cost to the economy: **$36.6 billion per year**
- Cost to the average household: **$2,500-$3,800 per year** (about $50/week!)

### Where Does Food Waste Happen?

Households are actually the **biggest** source of food waste, responsible for about **32%** of all food waste in Australia (2.5 million tonnes per year).

**Most commonly wasted foods:**
1. Vegetables (29%)
2. Fruit (22%)
3. Leftovers and prepared meals
4. Bakery items (21%)
5. Dairy products
6. Meat

### Why Does Food Waste Matter for the Environment?

When food ends up in landfill, it doesn't just disappear. As it breaks down, it releases **methane**—a greenhouse gas that is **28 times more potent** than carbon dioxide.

About **92%** of household food waste in Australia still goes directly to landfill.

### How to Reduce Food Waste

**At home:**
- **Plan meals** and make a shopping list
- **Understand date labels** (remember: best-before = quality, use-by = safety)
- **Store food properly** to extend its life
- **Use leftovers** creatively
- **First in, first out:** Use older items before newer ones
- **Compost** what you can't eat

**Food rescue organisations** also play an important role:
- **Foodbank** delivers 92+ million meals per year
- **OzHarvest** rescues 441,500 meals per month
- **SecondBite** rescued 25.2 million kg of food in 2023

## Convenience Foods: The Trade-Offs

**Convenience foods** are commercially prepared foods designed for easy consumption and minimal preparation. They're a big part of modern life—but they come with trade-offs.

### Types of Convenience Foods

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Ready-to-eat | Pre-made sandwiches, sushi, salads |
| Ready-to-heat | Frozen meals, canned soups, microwave rice |
| Ready-to-cook | Meal kits, marinated meats, stir-fry mixes |

### Advantages

- Save time and effort
- Consistent quality and taste
- Extended shelf life
- Built-in portion control
- No cooking skills required
- Wide variety available
- Can be safer (commercially controlled processes)

### Disadvantages

- Often higher in salt, sugar, and saturated fat
- More packaging (environmental impact)
- Generally less nutritious than home-prepared equivalents
- May contain more additives
- Usually more expensive per serve
- May be ultra-processed

### Making Better Convenience Choices

Not all convenience foods are created equal! Some healthier options include:
- **Frozen vegetables and fruits:** Nutrients are preserved by flash-freezing
- **Canned legumes:** Ready-to-use protein, just rinse to reduce sodium
- **Plain Greek yoghurt:** High protein, minimal processing
- **Canned fish:** Convenient protein source
- **Microwavable brown rice:** Quick whole grain option
- **Pre-cut vegetables:** Saves preparation time without compromising nutrition

## Food Packaging and the Environment

Food packaging serves important purposes—it protects food, extends shelf life, provides required information, and prevents contamination. But it also creates enormous environmental problems.

### Australian Packaging Statistics

- 86% of all packaging **CAN** be recycled
- But only 56% is actually recycled
- **Plastic packaging recycling rate: only 19-20%**—the worst performer
- 84% of plastic waste goes to landfill
- 130,000 tonnes of plastic enters Australia's oceans each year

### Australia's 2025 National Packaging Targets

1. 100% of packaging to be reusable, recyclable, or compostable
2. 70% of plastic packaging being recycled or composted
3. 50% average recycled content in packaging
4. Phase out problematic single-use plastics

### What Can You Do?

Remember the hierarchy: **Reduce → Reuse → Recycle**

- **Reduce:** Buy products with less packaging; choose concentrated products; avoid single-serve packages
- **Reuse:** Choose reusable containers, bags, and bottles
- **Recycle:** Learn what can be recycled in your area; rinse containers; keep recycling uncontaminated

---

## Eating Seasonally in Australia

Eating **seasonal** produce means choosing fruits and vegetables that are naturally in season in your region. Seasonal produce is typically fresher, tastier, more nutritious, and has a lower environmental footprint.

**Summer (December–February)**
- Fruits: mangoes, berries, stone fruits (peaches, nectarines, plums), watermelon, cherries
- Vegetables: tomatoes, corn, zucchini, capsicum, cucumber, beans

**Autumn (March–May)**
- Fruits: apples, pears, figs, grapes, quinces
- Vegetables: pumpkin, mushrooms, broccoli, eggplant, sweet potato

**Winter (June–August)**
- Fruits: citrus (oranges, mandarins, lemons, grapefruit), kiwifruit
- Vegetables: cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, leafy greens, cabbage, silverbeet

**Spring (September–November)**
- Fruits: strawberries, pineapple, papaya
- Vegetables: asparagus, peas, artichokes, broad beans, spring onions

# Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

## Food Properties and Cooking Methods Summary

| Food Property | Recommended Methods | Why |
|---------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Tender meat** (fillet, chicken breast) | Grilling, frying, quick roasting | Doesn't need long cooking; preserves tenderness |
| **Tough meat** (brisket, shanks) | Braising, stewing, slow cooking | Needs time to convert collagen to gelatin |
| **Delicate** (fish, eggs) | Poaching, steaming, gentle baking | Gentle methods prevent overcooking and drying |
| **High starch** (potatoes, rice) | Boiling, steaming | Water needed for gelatinisation |
| **For browning** (anything you want crispy!) | Dry heat: roasting, grilling, frying | High, dry heat needed for Maillard reaction |
| **Nutrient preservation** | Steaming, microwaving, stir-frying | Minimal water contact and short cooking time |

---

## Key Temperatures to Remember

| Temperature | What Happens |
|-------------|--------------|
| 5°C | Top of safe refrigeration temperature |
| 5-60°C | **Danger zone** (bacteria multiply rapidly) |
| 62-65°C | Egg white coagulates |
| 65-70°C | Egg yolk coagulates |
| 70-82°C | Collagen converts to gelatin |
| 85-96°C | Simmering temperature |
| ~96°C | Starch fully gelatinises |
| 100°C | Water boils |
| 140°C+ | Maillard reaction begins |
| 160-180°C | Caramelisation occurs |

---

## Reading Labels: Quick Reference

**Use the per 100g column to compare products!**

| Nutrient | Low (good) | High (limit) |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Sugar | ≤5g per 100g | >15g per 100g |
| Sodium | <120mg per 100g | >400mg per 100g |
| Saturated fat | ≤1.5g per 100g | Higher amounts |
| Fibre | ≥3g per 100g is a good source | — |

**Date marking:**
- **Use-by** = Safety (don't eat after this date)
- **Best-before** = Quality (still safe after, but might not be at its best)

---

## Making Sustainable Food Choices

1. **Eat more plants, less meat** (especially beef and lamb)
2. **Reduce food waste** (plan meals, understand date labels, use leftovers)
3. **Choose seasonal produce** when possible
4. **Be thoughtful about packaging** (reduce, reuse, recycle)
5. **Cook at home more often** (generally healthier and less wasteful than convenience foods)

## Final Review Questions

1. A recipe tells you to "sear the meat to seal in the juices." Is this scientifically accurate? Explain what searing actually does.

2. You're making a cheese sauce and it turns out lumpy. Using your knowledge of gelatinisation, explain what probably went wrong and how to prevent it next time.

3. Compare these two breakfast cereals using only the Nutrition Information Panel:
   - Cereal A: 1,580kJ, 8.2g protein, 3.5g fat, 1.2g saturated fat, 62g carbs, 24g sugars, 380mg sodium per 100g
   - Cereal B: 1,510kJ, 11g protein, 6.2g fat, 0.8g saturated fat, 56g carbs, 3.8g sugars, 12mg sodium per 100g
   
   Which would be the healthier choice? Justify your answer.

4. Your grandmother stores bread in the fridge "to keep it fresh." Using your knowledge of starch retrogradation, explain why this might not be the best approach and suggest a better storage method.

5. You're designing a meal that needs to be both nutritious and environmentally sustainable. What food choices would you make and why?

6. A food label says "Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients" and shows a bar chart that's about 40% filled. What does this tell you about the product?

7. Explain why braising is the best cooking method for lamb shanks, while grilling is best for lamb cutlets. Use your knowledge of protein and collagen to support your answer.

MC QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: 4 options (A-D). One unambiguous correct answer.
STEM: Clear, focused, no ambiguity. Novel scenarios preferred over verbatim recall.

LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL - common AI failure):
- Correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors. This is a major test-taking giveaway.
- Students learn "longest answer = correct" — do not reinforce this pattern.
- EITHER keep correct answer pithy and concise (preferred)
- OR extend ALL distractors to match correct answer's length/detail
- All options within ±20% character count. Measure and verify.
- If correct answer needs qualification, add similar qualifiers to distractors.
- Example BAD: Correct="The mitochondria converts glucose into ATP through cellular respiration" vs Distractor="The nucleus"
- Example GOOD: Correct="Mitochondria" / Distractors="Nucleus", "Ribosome", "Chloroplast" (all single words)
- Example GOOD: All options are full sentences of similar length with similar detail level.

OPTIONS: Grammatically parallel with stem. Same semantic category. Shuffleable without grammatical tells.
DISTRACTORS: Must represent real student misconceptions. Each should attract 5-25% of uninformed test-takers. Plausible in context/scope/magnitude. Match complexity and detail level of correct answer.
PROHIBITED: "All of the above", "None of the above", joke answers, obviously wrong options, trick wording.
CORRECT ANSWER: Position varies across questions (don't cluster on one letter).
EXPLANATIONS: Required for correct answer AND each distractor. Address specific misconception.

CLOZE QUESTION SPEC:
FORMAT: Sentence(s) with {{blank:N}} placeholders. Exactly 3 options per blank (1 correct + 2 distractors).
BLANK SELECTION - MUST blank: Key terminology, central concepts, cause-effect words, process steps, relationship indicators.
BLANK SELECTION - NEVER blank: Articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), conjunctions (and/but/or), pronouns (it/they), high-frequency verbs (is/are/has).
TEST: "Can student answer using ONLY grammar/syntax?" → YES = bad blank. "Does answering require content knowledge?" → YES = good blank.
GRAMMATICAL PARALLELISM - ALL options must match: Part of speech. Verb tense/person/number. Article agreement. Singular/plural.
LENGTH PARITY (CRITICAL): All options must be similar length (within 20%). The correct answer must NOT be longer than distractors—this is a common flaw that makes the answer obvious. Solutions: (1) Keep correct answer pithy/concise, OR (2) Extend distractors to match correct answer length by adding plausible detail. Example of FAILURE: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "ribosomes", "DNA" — length disparity reveals the answer. Example of SUCCESS: correct="membrane-bound organelles" vs distractors "free-floating ribosomes", "circular DNA molecules".
DISTRACTORS: Same rules as MC—real misconceptions, plausible, same semantic category. Pad distractors with plausible qualifiers if needed for length parity.
DENSITY: Max 1-2 blanks per sentence. Never blank first or last sentence of passage.
PROHIBITED: Blanking function words, absurd options, multiple defensible answers, correct answer noticeably longer than distractors.
