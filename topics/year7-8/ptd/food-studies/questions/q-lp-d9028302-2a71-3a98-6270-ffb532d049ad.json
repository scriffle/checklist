      "distractors": [

      "correct": "Without mandatory requirements, manufacturers could omit unfavourable information like high sugar, allergens, or additives, leaving consumers unable to make safe and informed choices",

      "correctExplanation": "While practical reasons justify some exemptions (small label space, unpackaged products), they do create gaps in allergen visibility. Some jurisdictions require allergen information to be available on request.",
      "distractors": [

      "correctExplanation": "Currently, the NIP shows total sugars without distinguishing natural from added. A separate added sugar line would reveal how much sugar was added during manufacturing, empowering healthier choices.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This change would have no impact because consumers already know exactly how much sugar is added to every product", "explanation": "Most consumers cannot determine added versus natural sugar from the current NIP. This change would significantly improve transparency." },

      "distractors": [
