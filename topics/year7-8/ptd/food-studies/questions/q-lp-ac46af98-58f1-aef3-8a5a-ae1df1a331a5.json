    { "type": "mc", "question": "Why does steaming preserve more nutrients than boiling?", "correct": "Food never touches the water so water-soluble vitamins cannot leach out", "correctExplanation": "In steaming, food sits above the water and is cooked by steam. Since it never contacts the water, water-soluble vitamins stay in the food.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Steaming uses higher temperatures which lock vitamins inside the food cells", "explanation": "Steam is at 100°C, similar to boiling water. The benefit is no direct water contact, not higher temperature." }, { "answer": "Steaming adds extra vitamins from the minerals dissolved in the boiling water below", "explanation": "Steam does not add vitamins. The benefit is preventing vitamin loss through water contact." }, { "answer": "Steaming takes longer than boiling which gives vitamins more time to be absorbed", "explanation": "Steaming is about preventing leaching, not about absorption time." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "Which vitamins are most likely to be lost when vegetables are boiled?", "correct": "Vitamin C and B vitamins", "correctExplanation": "Vitamin C and B vitamins are water-soluble, meaning they dissolve in water and leach into the cooking water during boiling.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Vitamin A and vitamin D", "explanation": "Vitamins A and D are fat-soluble, not water-soluble, so they are not easily lost in boiling water." }, { "answer": "Vitamin K and vitamin E", "explanation": "Vitamins K and E are fat-soluble and do not readily dissolve in water." }, { "answer": "Calcium and iron", "explanation": "Calcium and iron are minerals, not vitamins. Water-soluble vitamins C and B are most affected by boiling." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "How much vitamin C can boiled broccoli lose to the cooking water?", "correct": "25-50%", "correctExplanation": "Boiled broccoli can lose 25-50% of its vitamin C to the cooking water, which is often discarded.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Less than 5%", "explanation": "Boiling causes significant vitamin C loss, far more than 5%. Up to 25-50% can be lost." }, { "answer": "100%", "explanation": "While significant, boiling does not remove all vitamin C. Loss is typically 25-50%." }, { "answer": "No loss occurs", "explanation": "Vitamin C does leach into boiling water. Losses of 25-50% are typical." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "What is the heat transfer medium used in steaming?", "correct": "Steam at 100°C", "correctExplanation": "Steam (water vapour at 100°C) surrounds the food and transfers heat without the food touching liquid water.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Hot oil at 180°C", "explanation": "Oil is used in frying, not steaming. Steaming uses steam at 100°C." }, { "answer": "Dry hot air at 200°C", "explanation": "Dry hot air is used in baking or roasting. Steaming uses moist steam." }, { "answer": "Direct flame contact", "explanation": "Direct flame is used in grilling. Steaming uses steam as the heat transfer medium." } ] },

They dissolve into the liquid water." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "Besides preserving nutrients, what other benefits does steaming offer compared to boiling?", "correct": "Steaming better preserves the colour, texture, and shape of vegetables", "correctExplanation": "Without direct water contact and turbulent agitation, steamed vegetables maintain their bright colour, firm texture, and original shape better than boiled vegetables.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Steaming makes vegetables taste sweeter because steam adds natural sugars to the food surface", "explanation": "Steam does not add sugars. The benefits are better colour, texture, and shape retention." }, { "answer": "Steaming is the only method that can cook vegetables because boiling cannot reach the required temperature", "explanation": "Both methods cook at similar temperatures. Steaming better preserves physical qualities of vegetables." }, { "answer": "Steaming is faster than boiling which saves time but does not affect the physical properties of food", "explanation": "Steaming does affect physical properties positively, preserving colour, texture, and shape." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "If you boil vegetables but drink the cooking water as soup, does the vitamin loss still matter?", "correct": "No, because the vitamins remain in the liquid that you consume rather than being discarded", "correctExplanation": "If the cooking water is consumed (as in soup), the dissolved vitamins are still ingested. The loss only matters when the cooking water is discarded.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Yes, because boiling permanently destroys all vitamins regardless of whether you consume the water", "explanation": "While some heat degradation occurs, most dissolved vitamins remain intact in the cooking water and can be consumed." }, { "answer": "Yes, because vitamins in water cannot be absorbed by the human body under any circumstances", "explanation": "Dissolved vitamins are absorbed effectively by the body. Consuming the cooking water recovers the leached vitamins." }, { "answer": "No, but only if you add vitamin supplements to the soup to replace what was lost during the boiling", "explanation": "Supplements are unnecessary. The dissolved vitamins in the cooking water are already present and consumable." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "Compare the nutrient retention of steaming versus microwaving vegetables.", "correct": "Both methods preserve nutrients well because both use minimal water contact, though steaming uses more water overall", "correctExplanation": "Microwaving with minimal water and steaming both limit vitamin leaching. Both are superior to boiling for nutrient retention.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Microwaving destroys all nutrients because radiation breaks down vitamin molecules completely", "explanation": "Microwaving actually preserves nutrients well because of short cooking times and minimal water use." }, { "answer": "Steaming is far superior to microwaving because steam adds nutrients that microwave radiation removes", "explanation": "Neither method adds nutrients. Both preserve nutrients well by minimising water contact." }, { "answer": "Boiling is superior to both because water helps preserve nutrients that heat would otherwise destroy", "explanation": "Boiling causes the most nutrient loss because vitamins dissolve into the water which is typically discarded." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "Why are fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) less affected by boiling than water-soluble vitamins?", "correct": "Fat-soluble vitamins do not dissolve readily in water, so they cannot leach into the cooking water", "correctExplanation": "Fat-soluble vitamins dissolve in fat, not water. Since boiling uses water, these vitamins remain in the food rather than dissolving into the cooking liquid.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Fat-soluble vitamins are physically larger molecules that cannot pass through plant cell walls into water", "explanation": "Molecular size is not the primary factor. Fat-soluble vitamins simply do not dissolve in water." }, { "answer": "Fat-soluble vitamins are stronger than water-soluble vitamins and resist being broken down by heat", "explanation": "Heat resistance varies among vitamins. The key factor is their inability to dissolve in water." }, { "answer": "Fat-soluble vitamins are only found in meat products which are never boiled during cooking at home", "explanation": "Fat-soluble vitamins are found in many foods including vegetables. They are unaffected by boiling because they do not dissolve in water." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "A student argues that blanching (briefly boiling then ice-bathing vegetables) loses fewer nutrients than extended boiling. Evaluate this claim.", "correct": "The claim is correct because shorter boiling time reduces the duration of vitamin leaching into the water", "correctExplanation": "Brief blanching limits the time vitamins have to dissolve into the water. Less time in boiling water means less nutrient loss compared to prolonged boiling.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "The claim is incorrect because any contact with boiling water destroys all vitamins instantly", "explanation": "Vitamin leaching is gradual. Brief contact causes less loss than extended boiling." }, { "answer": "The claim is incorrect because ice-bathing destroys any vitamins that survived the boiling process", "explanation": "Ice-bathing stops cooking and preserves remaining nutrients. It does not destroy vitamins." }, { "answer": "The claim is irrelevant because blanching and boiling cause identical nutrient loss regardless of time", "explanation": "Time in water directly affects the amount of leaching. Shorter exposure means less vitamin loss." } ] },

Rank these methods from best to worst: boiling for 10 minutes, steaming for 5 minutes, microwaving with 1 tablespoon of water.", "correct": "Microwaving, then steaming, then boiling — all minimise water contact but boiling causes the most leaching", "correctExplanation": "Microwaving uses minimal water and short time. Steaming avoids water contact. Boiling submerges food in water, causing the most vitamin C leaching.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Boiling, then steaming, then microwaving — because more water preserves more vitamins", "explanation": "More water causes more leaching, not less. Boiling is the worst method for vitamin C retention." }, { "answer": "All three methods produce identical vitamin C retention regardless of water contact", "explanation": "Water contact significantly affects vitamin C loss. Less water contact means better retention." }, { "answer": "Steaming, then boiling, then microwaving — because steam is the gentlest form of heat", "explanation": "Microwaving with minimal water often matches or exceeds steaming for nutrient retention." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "A restaurant serves boiled vegetables with the cooking water discarded. A customer complains that the vegetables are less nutritious than steamed vegetables. Is the customer correct?", "correct": "Yes, because water-soluble vitamins leached into the discarded cooking water, reducing the nutritional content of the served vegetables", "correctExplanation": "Boiling and discarding the water removes dissolved vitamins C and B. Steamed vegetables retain more of these nutrients because they never contact water.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "No, because all cooking methods destroy the same amount of vitamins regardless of water use", "explanation": "Water contact significantly increases vitamin loss. Steaming preserves more water-soluble vitamins." }, { "answer": "No, because restaurants use special water that prevents any vitamin loss during the boiling process", "explanation": "No special water prevents vitamin leaching. Standard boiling causes significant nutrient loss." }, { "answer": "Yes, but only because the customer ordered more expensive vegetables that should have been steamed", "explanation": "The nutritional difference is due to cooking method, not price or customer order." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "A school canteen switches from boiling all vegetables to steaming them. Explain the nutritional impact of this change for students.", "correct": "Students will receive more water-soluble vitamins from their vegetables because steaming prevents leaching into discarded water", "correctExplanation": "Switching to steaming means less vitamin C and B vitamin loss, improving the nutritional value of vegetables served to students.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Students will receive fewer nutrients because steaming cooks vegetables less thoroughly than boiling", "explanation": "Steaming cooks vegetables thoroughly while preserving more nutrients. Cooking completeness is not the issue." }, { "answer": "The change will have no nutritional impact because school canteen vegetables have no vitamins regardless", "explanation": "Fresh vegetables contain significant vitamins. The cooking method affects how many are retained." }, { "answer": "Students will receive more fat-soluble vitamins because steaming preserves these better than boiling", "explanation": "Fat-soluble vitamins are not significantly lost in boiling either. The improvement is in water-soluble vitamins." } ] },

Steaming is preferred for vegetables due to quality preservation." } ] },
    { "type": "mc", "question": "A food blogger claims that steaming vegetables for too long can still cause significant nutrient loss. Evaluate this claim.", "correct": "The claim has merit because extended steaming can cause some heat-degradation of heat-sensitive vitamins like vitamin C, though less than boiling", "correctExplanation": "While steaming prevents leaching, prolonged high heat can still degrade heat-sensitive vitamins like vitamin C through thermal breakdown, though losses are less than boiling.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "The claim is completely false because steaming can never cause any nutrient loss regardless of duration", "explanation": "Heat itself can degrade some vitamins over time. Steaming prevents leaching but not heat degradation." }, { "answer": "The claim is completely true because steaming for any length causes identical losses to boiling for same duration", "explanation": "Steaming causes less nutrient loss than boiling because it prevents water leaching. But over-steaming can cause some heat degradation." }, { "answer": "The claim is irrelevant because cooking time has no effect on nutrient content under any cooking method", "explanation": "Cooking time does affect nutrient content. Longer heat exposure can degrade heat-sensitive vitamins." } ] },

    { "type": "mc", "question": "Evaluate the overall importance of cooking method choice for nutrient intake, considering the full context of a person's diet.", "correct": "Cooking method matters but eating a variety of vegetables is more important than the cooking method used; any cooked vegetable is more nutritious than no vegetable at all", "correctExplanation": "While steaming preserves more vitamins, the most important factor is eating vegetables regularly. A person who enjoys roasted vegetables and eats them daily is better off than someone who avoids vegetables because they dislike steaming.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "Cooking method is the single most important factor in nutrition and only steamed vegetables should ever be consumed", "explanation": "Overall vegetable consumption matters more than cooking method. Enjoying vegetables in any form is most important." }, { "answer": "Cooking method is completely irrelevant because the body absorbs identical nutrients regardless of how food is prepared", "explanation": "Cooking method does affect nutrient content, but eating vegetables in any form is the priority." }, { "answer": "Only raw vegetables have any nutritional value and all cooked vegetables should be avoided entirely for health", "explanation": "Cooked vegetables retain significant nutrition. Some nutrients become more available when cooked." } ] },

It creates caramelised, complex flavours through high-heat reactions." }, { "answer": "steamed", "explanation": "Steamed flavours are mild. Roasting produces distinct caramelised flavours." }, { "answer": "frozen", "explanation": "Frozen is not a flavour type. Roasting creates caramelised flavours." } ] } } },

The cooking method is secondary to actually consuming vegetables regularly.", "distractors": [ { "answer": "minimum", "explanation": "A minimum would imply eating as few as possible. Eating a variety ensures a broad nutrient intake." }, { "answer": "absence", "explanation": "An absence of vegetables would be nutritionally poor. Eating a variety is the priority." }, { "answer": "surplus", "explanation": "Surplus implies excess. Eating a variety of vegetables is the recommended approach." } ] } } }
