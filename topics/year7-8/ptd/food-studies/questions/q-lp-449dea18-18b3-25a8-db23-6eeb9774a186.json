      "correct": "This is incorrect because essential nutrients like calcium, vitamin C, and many vitamins would be missing",

      "distractors": [

      "correctExplanation": "The nutrient-based approach helps people understand which foods can substitute for each other and ensures all nutritional needs are met.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because all plant foods contain exactly the same nutrients as all animal foods", "explanation": "Plant and animal foods have different nutrient profiles. The grouping helps match foods that provide similar key nutrients." },
