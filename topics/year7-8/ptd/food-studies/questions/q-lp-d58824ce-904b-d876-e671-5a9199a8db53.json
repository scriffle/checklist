      "correctExplanation": "Percentage labelling and ingredient order show that Brand A is predominantly tomato (80%), while Brand B is mainly water and sugar with minimal tomato (15%).",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Brand B has more tomato because tomato paste is more concentrated than whole tomatoes", "explanation": "Even accounting for concentration, 15% paste provides far less tomato than 80% whole tomatoes." },
