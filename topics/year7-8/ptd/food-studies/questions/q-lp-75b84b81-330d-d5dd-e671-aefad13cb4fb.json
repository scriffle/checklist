    {"type":"mc","question":"Why is food waste in landfill particularly harmful to the environment?","correct":"Because anaerobic decomposition produces methane, which is 25 times more potent than CO2","correctExplanation":"In landfill, food decomposes without oxygen (anaerobically), producing methane — a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because food in landfill attracts animals that spread disease to humans","explanation":"While pests can be an issue, the primary environmental concern is methane production."},{"answer":"Because food waste takes up the most physical space in all landfills","explanation":"While food waste does take space, the main environmental impact is greenhouse gas production."},{"answer":"Because food waste in landfill contaminates all drinking water supplies","explanation":"While leachate can be an issue, the primary environmental impact is methane emissions."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"How does confusion between use-by and best-before dates contribute to food waste?","correct":"People throw away safe food past its best-before date thinking it is unsafe","correctExplanation":"Best-before dates indicate quality, not safety. Food past its best-before date is still safe to eat but many people confuse it with use-by dates and throw it away unnecessarily.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because use-by and best-before dates mean exactly the same thing","explanation":"They have different meanings: use-by is about safety, best-before is about quality."},{"answer":"Because best-before dates are always set too early by manufacturers","explanation":"While dates may be conservative, the main issue is consumer confusion about what they mean."},{"answer":"Because all food becomes poisonous immediately after any date on the label","explanation":"Only food past its use-by date may be unsafe; best-before food is safe but may lose quality."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why does food waste account for approximately 3% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions?","correct":"Because millions of tonnes of wasted food decompose anaerobically, releasing methane","correctExplanation":"With 7.6 million tonnes of food waste, much of which ends up in landfill, the anaerobic decomposition produces significant amounts of methane, contributing about 3% of total emissions.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because growing food uses 3% of all electricity generated in Australia","explanation":"While farming uses energy, the 3% figure specifically relates to emissions from decomposing waste."},{"answer":"Because food transport trucks produce 3% of all vehicle emissions in the country","explanation":"Transport emissions are separate; the 3% relates to decomposing food waste in landfill."},{"answer":"Because 3% of all factories in Australia are food processing facilities","explanation":"The 3% relates to emissions from food waste decomposition, not the number of food factories."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Why is reducing food waste considered both an environmental and economic issue?","correct":"It reduces greenhouse gas emissions AND saves households and businesses significant money","correctExplanation":"Less food waste means less methane in landfill (environmental) and significant savings — $2,000-2,500 per household annually (economic). It addresses both issues simultaneously.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because food waste only affects the environment and has no economic consequences","explanation":"Food waste has massive economic impacts — $36.6 billion annually in Australia alone."},{"answer":"Because food waste only costs money and has no environmental consequences at all","explanation":"Food waste produces methane in landfill, contributing to climate change."},{"answer":"Because reducing food waste would increase food prices for all Australian consumers","explanation":"Reducing waste would help lower costs, not increase prices."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"What are the most commonly wasted foods in Australian households?","correct":"Vegetables, bread, leftovers, fruit, and drinks","correctExplanation":"Research shows vegetables are the most wasted food group, followed by bread, leftovers, fruit, and drinks in Australian households.","distractors":[{"answer":"Meat, cheese, eggs, and dairy products primarily","explanation":"While some dairy and meat is wasted, vegetables and bread top the list."},{"answer":"Only packaged and processed snack food products","explanation":"Fresh foods like vegetables and bread are wasted more than packaged snacks."},{"answer":"Canned goods, frozen meals, and dried pasta only","explanation":"These shelf-stable items are wasted less; fresh produce and bread are wasted most."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Explain why meal planning helps reduce food waste.","correct":"It ensures you buy only what you need and use ingredients before they expire","correctExplanation":"Planning meals in advance helps you create shopping lists with only needed items, reducing impulse purchases and ensuring ingredients are used before they spoil.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because meal planning eliminates the need to refrigerate any food items","explanation":"Meal planning still requires refrigeration; it reduces waste by ensuring food is used in time."},{"answer":"Because planned meals always take less time to cook than unplanned meals","explanation":"Cooking time isn't the benefit; reducing waste through intentional purchasing is the benefit."},{"answer":"Because meal planning means you never need to go grocery shopping at all","explanation":"You still shop, but you buy what you need rather than items that may go to waste."}]},
    {"type":"tf","question":"If food waste were a country, it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.","correct":"True","correctExplanation":"Global food waste produces such enormous methane emissions that if it were a country, it would rank as the third largest greenhouse gas emitter after China and the USA.","distractors":[{"answer":"False","explanation":"This surprising statistic is accurate and highlights the enormous scale of global food waste emissions."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about date labels.","sentence":"A {{blank:1}} date indicates food safety, while a best-before date indicates food quality.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"use-by","correctExplanation":"Use-by dates are about safety — food should not be consumed after this date. Best-before dates indicate quality — food is safe but may decline in taste or texture.","distractors":[{"answer":"sell-by","explanation":"Sell-by dates are for retailer stock management, not a regulated consumer safety date."},{"answer":"made-on","explanation":"Made-on dates show when the product was manufactured, not when it becomes unsafe."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about food waste sources.","sentence":"{{blank:1}} are the largest single contributor to food waste in Australia, accounting for about 34% of total food waste.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"Households","correctExplanation":"Australian households generate approximately 34% of total food waste, making them the largest single contributor to the problem.","distractors":[{"answer":"Restaurants","explanation":"While restaurants contribute to food waste, households are the largest single contributor."},{"answer":"Supermarkets","explanation":"Supermarkets generate food waste but are not the largest contributor."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about waste reduction.","sentence":"Proper food {{blank:1}} helps food last longer, reducing the amount that goes to waste before it can be eaten.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"storage","correctExplanation":"Storing food correctly (appropriate temperature, sealed containers, correct location) extends its life and reduces waste.","distractors":[{"answer":"colouring","explanation":"Food colouring has no impact on food waste or shelf life."},{"answer":"advertising","explanation":"Food advertising doesn't help reduce waste; proper storage does."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"You find a tin of baked beans in your cupboard that is 3 months past its best-before date. What should you do?","correct":"Check the tin is intact and not damaged, then it is likely still safe to eat","correctExplanation":"Best-before dates indicate quality, not safety. Canned food in an undamaged tin is safe well past its best-before date, though quality may have slightly declined.","distractors":[{"answer":"Throw it away immediately because it is past its date and unsafe to eat","explanation":"Best-before dates are about quality, not safety. This common misunderstanding contributes to food waste."},{"answer":"Open it and check if it smells bad before discarding the entire tin","explanation":"While checking is reasonable, the tin is very likely safe; no need to assume it must be discarded."},{"answer":"Return it to the supermarket for a refund because it is expired now","explanation":"Best-before dates don't make products expired or eligible for return; the food is still safe."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Your family bought too many bananas and they are turning brown. Instead of throwing them away, what could you do?","correct":"Make banana bread, smoothies, or freeze them for later use","correctExplanation":"Brown bananas are perfectly safe and actually sweeter, making them ideal for banana bread or smoothies. Freezing preserves them for future use.","distractors":[{"answer":"Throw them away because brown bananas are unsafe to eat","explanation":"Brown bananas are safe and naturally sweeter; they are excellent for baking."},{"answer":"Put them in the refrigerator to reverse the browning process","explanation":"Refrigeration can slow further ripening but won't reverse browning. Using them in recipes is better."},{"answer":"Compost them because there is nothing else you can do with them","explanation":"Composting is a last resort; brown bananas have many culinary uses before composting."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A school is trying to reduce food waste from its canteen. Which strategy would be most effective?","correct":"Survey students about food preferences and adjust portion sizes and menu options","correctExplanation":"Understanding what students actually eat helps the canteen prepare appropriate quantities and offer popular choices, reducing plate waste and over-preparation.","distractors":[{"answer":"Ban all food from the canteen so no food can be wasted at all","explanation":"Closing the canteen doesn't solve food waste; it just moves the problem elsewhere."},{"answer":"Make students pay double for food to discourage buying food they won't eat","explanation":"Increasing prices is punitive and doesn't address the root cause of waste."},{"answer":"Serve only one meal option each day with no choices for students","explanation":"Limited choice may increase waste if students don't like the option and leave food uneaten."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Your neighbour says 'food waste isn't a big deal — it's natural and just goes back into the soil.' How would you respond?","correct":"In landfill, food waste produces methane which is 25 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas","correctExplanation":"Food waste in landfill decomposes anaerobically (without oxygen), producing methane — unlike composting, which is aerobic and produces CO2. Landfill decomposition is far more harmful.","distractors":[{"answer":"Your neighbour is correct because food waste is completely harmless to the environment","explanation":"Food waste in landfill produces significant methane emissions contributing to climate change."},{"answer":"Food waste is only harmful if it contains plastic packaging mixed in with it","explanation":"Food waste itself produces methane in landfill, regardless of packaging."},{"answer":"Food waste is harmful because it attracts rats, which is the only environmental problem","explanation":"While pests are an issue, the methane emissions are the primary environmental concern."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"You notice your family regularly throws away leftover dinner. What practical change could reduce this waste?","correct":"Cook smaller portions or plan to use leftovers for lunch the next day","correctExplanation":"Reducing portion sizes or planning to repurpose leftovers (e.g., dinner rice becomes fried rice for lunch) prevents food from being thrown away.","distractors":[{"answer":"Stop cooking dinner and eat takeaway instead to avoid all waste","explanation":"Takeaway food also generates waste; cooking appropriate portions is more effective."},{"answer":"Cook extra food and throw away only the amount that doesn't fit in the bin","explanation":"This doesn't reduce waste at all; it just accepts waste as inevitable."},{"answer":"Skip meals entirely on days when leftovers are expected to reduce waste","explanation":"Skipping meals is unhealthy; better to plan portions or use leftovers creatively."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A supermarket is about to throw away fresh produce that is slightly blemished but perfectly safe. What could they do instead?","correct":"Donate it to a food bank or sell it at a reduced price to reduce waste","correctExplanation":"Blemished but safe produce can be donated to food banks, sold at discount, or used in prepared foods. This reduces waste while helping those in need.","distractors":[{"answer":"They must throw it away because selling imperfect produce is illegal in Australia","explanation":"Selling blemished produce is legal; it's edible and safe, just less visually appealing."},{"answer":"They should stop stocking fresh produce to avoid waste completely","explanation":"Removing fresh produce would harm nutrition; better to manage imperfect produce creatively."},{"answer":"They should raise prices on all produce to cover the cost of the wasted items","explanation":"Price increases don't reduce waste; donation and discounting address the actual problem."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Composting food scraps at home instead of putting them in landfill reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Why?","correct":"Composting is aerobic, producing CO2 instead of the much more potent methane from landfill","correctExplanation":"Composting decomposes food with oxygen (aerobic), producing CO2. Landfill decomposes without oxygen (anaerobic), producing methane — 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because compost bins are always located outdoors where gases disperse more quickly","explanation":"The location doesn't matter; the chemical process (aerobic vs anaerobic) determines which gas is produced."},{"answer":"Because composting destroys all carbon in food so no greenhouse gas is produced","explanation":"Composting does produce CO2, but CO2 is 25 times less potent than the methane from landfill."},{"answer":"Because composting only works with plant-based food and excludes all other waste","explanation":"Composting works with most food scraps; the key point is the aerobic process produces less harmful gas."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about food dates.","sentence":"Best-before dates indicate food {{blank:1}}, not safety, so food past this date may still be perfectly safe to eat.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"quality","correctExplanation":"Best-before dates tell you when the food will be at its best quality. After this date, the food may lose some taste or texture but is generally still safe.","distractors":[{"answer":"danger","explanation":"Best-before dates are not about danger or safety; they indicate quality decline."},{"answer":"price","explanation":"Best-before dates indicate quality, not pricing information."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about reducing waste.","sentence":"Meal {{blank:1}} helps reduce food waste by ensuring you buy only what you need and use ingredients before they spoil.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"planning","correctExplanation":"Meal planning involves deciding what to cook in advance and creating shopping lists, which prevents over-purchasing and ensures food is used before spoiling.","distractors":[{"answer":"skipping","explanation":"Skipping meals is unhealthy and doesn't address the root cause of food waste."},{"answer":"ordering","explanation":"While ordering food may reduce cooking waste, meal planning specifically addresses household food purchase and use."}]}}},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about composting.","sentence":"Composting decomposes food {{blank:1}}, producing CO2 instead of the much more potent methane from landfill.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"aerobically","correctExplanation":"Aerobic composting (with oxygen) breaks down food into CO2, which is 25 times less potent as a greenhouse gas compared to the methane produced by anaerobic landfill decomposition.","distractors":[{"answer":"anaerobically","explanation":"Anaerobic decomposition (without oxygen) occurs in landfill and produces methane; composting is aerobic."},{"answer":"chemically","explanation":"While decomposition involves chemical processes, the key distinction is aerobic (with oxygen) vs anaerobic (without oxygen)."}]}}}

    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the claim: 'Individual household changes to reduce food waste can't make a meaningful difference to the national problem.'","correct":"This is false because households are the largest contributor, so collective small changes have significant impact","correctExplanation":"Households generate 34% of food waste. If each household reduced waste by even a small amount, the collective impact on the 7.6 million tonnes would be substantial.","distractors":[{"answer":"This is true because only government and industry can solve the food waste crisis","explanation":"While policy helps, household behaviour change is essential given households are the largest contributor."},{"answer":"This is true because household waste is too small to affect greenhouse emissions","explanation":"Household waste collectively produces significant methane; individual changes do add up."},{"answer":"This is false but only because individual households create all food waste in Australia","explanation":"Households create 34%, not all food waste; commercial and industrial sources also contribute."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse the environmental argument for food rescue organisations like OzHarvest that redistribute surplus food to people in need.","correct":"They simultaneously address food waste, greenhouse emissions, and food insecurity","correctExplanation":"Food rescue diverts edible food from landfill (reducing methane), provides meals to vulnerable people (addressing food insecurity), and reduces the resources wasted in producing that food.","distractors":[{"answer":"They only help hungry people and have no effect on environmental outcomes","explanation":"By diverting food from landfill, they also reduce methane emissions and resource waste."},{"answer":"They are counterproductive because they encourage businesses to overproduce food","explanation":"Food rescue works with surplus that already exists; it doesn't incentivise overproduction."},{"answer":"They are unnecessary because all surplus food in Australia is already composted","explanation":"Most surplus food goes to landfill, not composting, which is why food rescue is valuable."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare the environmental impact of composting food scraps versus sending them to landfill.","correct":"Composting produces CO2 aerobically while landfill produces methane anaerobically, which is 25 times worse","correctExplanation":"Aerobic composting produces CO2 and creates useful soil amendment. Anaerobic landfill decomposition produces methane (25x more potent). Composting is significantly better environmentally.","distractors":[{"answer":"Both methods produce identical greenhouse gas emissions in the same amounts","explanation":"The gases produced are different: CO2 from composting vs methane from landfill, with vastly different potency."},{"answer":"Landfill is better because it permanently seals food waste underground safely","explanation":"Landfill decomposition releases methane into the atmosphere; it's not safely sealed."},{"answer":"Composting is worse because it spreads food waste over a larger area of land","explanation":"While composting uses space, the environmental benefit of avoiding methane far outweighs this."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate whether 'best-before' date labelling should be reformed to reduce food waste.","correct":"Clearer labelling and education could prevent people from unnecessarily discarding safe food","correctExplanation":"Many consumers confuse best-before with use-by, discarding safe food. Clearer labels, public education, or even removing best-before dates from long-life products could reduce waste significantly.","distractors":[{"answer":"Best-before dates should be removed from all products without any replacement","explanation":"Removing all dates could create safety issues for perishable foods; targeted reform is more appropriate."},{"answer":"Best-before dates are already perfectly understood and no changes are needed at all","explanation":"Research shows widespread consumer confusion between best-before and use-by dates."},{"answer":"Best-before dates should be replaced with use-by dates on all products","explanation":"Use-by dates on shelf-stable products would be misleading since they imply a safety risk that doesn't exist."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse why food waste is described as a 'triple bottom line' issue affecting environmental, economic, and social outcomes.","correct":"It produces greenhouse gases (environmental), costs billions (economic), and occurs while people go hungry (social)","correctExplanation":"Food waste harms the environment through methane, costs $36.6 billion nationally, and is morally problematic when millions of Australians experience food insecurity simultaneously.","distractors":[{"answer":"Because it affects three different types of food: fresh, frozen, and canned products","explanation":"Triple bottom line refers to environmental, economic, and social impacts, not food categories."},{"answer":"Because food waste takes three years to decompose fully in Australian landfill sites","explanation":"Triple bottom line is an impact framework, not a decomposition timeline."},{"answer":"Because three government departments are responsible for managing food waste in Australia","explanation":"Triple bottom line refers to three dimensions of impact, not three government departments."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A policy maker proposes banning supermarkets from discarding edible food. Evaluate the potential benefits and challenges.","correct":"It would reduce waste and benefit food banks, but implementation and enforcement would be complex","correctExplanation":"Such laws (like France's 2016 ban) reduce waste and increase donations. Challenges include defining 'edible', managing logistics, ensuring food safety, and enforcement costs.","distractors":[{"answer":"This would solve food waste completely with no implementation challenges whatsoever","explanation":"While beneficial, implementation involves food safety, logistics, and enforcement challenges."},{"answer":"This would be harmful because supermarkets would stop stocking fresh produce entirely","explanation":"France's experience shows supermarkets adapt by improving forecasting and donating surplus."},{"answer":"This is impossible because there is no precedent for such legislation anywhere globally","explanation":"France implemented similar legislation in 2016, providing a real-world precedent."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Evaluate the relative effectiveness of these household food waste strategies: meal planning, proper storage, and composting.","correct":"Meal planning prevents waste at the source; storage extends life; composting manages unavoidable waste","correctExplanation":"Prevention (planning) is most effective as it stops waste before it occurs. Storage extends food life. Composting is a last resort that reduces landfill impact but doesn't prevent waste.","distractors":[{"answer":"All three strategies are equally effective at reducing the environmental impact of waste","explanation":"Prevention is more effective than management; composting still represents wasted food and resources."},{"answer":"Composting is the most effective because it turns all food waste into useful compost","explanation":"Composting manages waste but doesn't prevent it; meal planning prevents waste entirely."},{"answer":"Only meal planning matters and the other strategies have no meaningful impact","explanation":"All three contribute, though prevention is most effective. Proper storage and composting add value."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Analyse the paradox that Australia wastes 7.6 million tonnes of food annually while also having significant food insecurity.","correct":"The surplus and insecurity coexist because food waste is a distribution and behaviour problem, not a supply problem","correctExplanation":"Australia produces enough food but wastes enormous amounts while some communities lack access. The issue is distribution, affordability, and behaviour, not total food production.","distractors":[{"answer":"There is no paradox because food waste and food insecurity are completely unrelated issues","explanation":"They are deeply connected: wasted food could address insecurity if redistributed effectively."},{"answer":"This paradox proves that Australia does not produce enough food for its population","explanation":"Australia produces more than enough; the problem is waste and distribution, not production."},{"answer":"This paradox only exists in theory and has no real-world implications for food policy","explanation":"This paradox has significant policy implications and drives food rescue and waste reduction programs."}]},
    {"type":"cloze","prompt":"Complete the sentence about food waste policy.","sentence":"France banned supermarkets from discarding edible food in 2016, requiring them to {{blank:1}} surplus food instead.","blanks":{"1":{"correct":"donate","correctExplanation":"France's 2016 law requires supermarkets to donate edible surplus food to charities rather than discarding it, setting a precedent for other countries.","distractors":[{"answer":"compost","explanation":"While composting is better than landfill, the French law specifically requires donation of edible food."},{"answer":"export","explanation":"The law requires domestic donation to charities, not export of surplus food."}]}}},
