      "type": "mc",
      "question": "What makes a cut of meat 'tough'?",
      "correct": "It contains a lot of connective tissue and collagen",
      "correctExplanation": "Tough cuts come from muscles that work hard (like legs and shoulders), which develop lots of connective tissue and collagen.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It has been stored in the refrigerator for too long", "explanation": "Storage does not make meat tough. High connective tissue content from hard-working muscles is what makes cuts tough." },

        { "answer": "It weighs more than one kilogram per piece", "explanation": "Weight does not determine toughness. Tough cuts have more connective tissue from being hard-working muscles." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Slow cooking in liquid for four or more hours", "explanation": "Slow cooking is suited to tough cuts. Tender cuts become dry and overcooked with prolonged cooking." },

      "question": "Which cooking method is best for tough cuts of meat?",
      "correct": "Slow cooking at low temperatures, such as braising or stewing",
      "correctExplanation": "Slow cooking at low temperatures gives connective tissue and collagen time to break down, converting them into gelatin and making the meat tender.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Quick grilling at very high heat for a few minutes", "explanation": "Quick grilling does not give connective tissue time to break down. Tough cuts need slow, low-heat cooking." },

      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Explain why a fillet steak becomes tough and dry if cooked for too long.",
      "correct": "Fillet has very little connective tissue, so prolonged cooking causes excessive protein coagulation without any collagen-to-gelatin conversion to compensate, resulting in dry, tough meat",
      "correctExplanation": "Unlike tough cuts, tender cuts lack collagen that would convert to gelatin during long cooking. Without this moisture source, prolonged cooking only tightens proteins and squeezes out moisture.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Fillet has too much fat that melts away completely, leaving only dry meat behind", "explanation": "Fillet is lean but the dryness comes from excessive protein coagulation, not fat loss." },

      "question": "How does collagen convert to gelatin during slow cooking?",
      "correct": "Sustained low heat over 2–4 hours gradually breaks down collagen fibres into soft, moist gelatin",
      "correctExplanation": "Collagen requires extended time at low temperatures (around 70–80°C) to hydrolyse into gelatin, which adds moisture and a silky texture to the meat.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Collagen instantly converts to gelatin the moment heat is applied", "explanation": "Collagen conversion takes 2–4 hours at low temperatures. It is not an instant process." },

        { "answer": "Collagen is removed by washing the meat before cooking, not by heat", "explanation": "Collagen is embedded in the meat's connective tissue and cannot be washed away. It converts to gelatin through slow cooking." }

      "correct": "Shanks are from a hard-working leg muscle with abundant collagen that converts to gelatin during long, slow cooking in liquid",
      "correctExplanation": "Leg muscles do a lot of work, developing strong connective tissue rich in collagen. Braising provides the sustained low heat and moisture needed to convert this collagen to gelatin.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Shanks are very small, so they cook quickly in any method", "explanation": "Shanks are not small, and their high collagen content requires slow cooking regardless of size." },
        { "answer": "Shanks contain no connective tissue, which makes them naturally tender for braising", "explanation": "The opposite is true. Shanks are rich in connective tissue, and braising breaks it down to create tenderness." },
        { "answer": "Shanks are always pre-cooked at the butcher before being sold", "explanation": "Shanks are sold raw. Their suitability for braising comes from their high collagen content." }

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "What is the relationship between the amount of work a muscle does and the tenderness of the cut?",
      "correct": "Muscles that do more work develop more connective tissue and collagen, making them tougher and requiring slower cooking",
      "correctExplanation": "Hard-working muscles (legs, shoulders) build up connective tissue for strength, while less active muscles (back, loin) remain tender with less connective tissue.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Muscles that work more are always more tender because exercise makes them softer", "explanation": "The opposite is true. Working muscles develop more connective tissue, making them tougher." },

      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Describe why slow-cooked tough cuts often have a rich, silky sauce.",
      "correct": "Collagen from the meat converts to gelatin during slow cooking, which dissolves into the cooking liquid and gives it a rich, silky texture",
      "correctExplanation": "As collagen converts to gelatin, some of it dissolves into the surrounding liquid, creating a naturally thickened, silky sauce without needing added thickeners.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The sauce is silky because the cook adds cornflour at the end of the cooking process", "explanation": "While thickeners can be added, the natural silkiness comes from gelatin dissolving from the meat into the liquid." },
        { "answer": "The sauce is silky because the meat releases all of its fat during cooking", "explanation": "While fat contributes to richness, the silky texture specifically comes from collagen converting to gelatin in the liquid." },
        { "answer": "The sauce is silky because slow cooking caramelises the water in the pot", "explanation": "Water does not caramelise. The silky texture comes from gelatin released by the conversion of collagen." }

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Why is it important to match the cooking method to the type of cut?",
      "correct": "Using the wrong method can make tender cuts dry and tough or leave tough cuts chewy and undercooked",
      "correctExplanation": "Tender cuts need quick, high heat to stay moist. Tough cuts need slow, low heat to break down collagen. Mismatching the method produces poor results.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It is not important because all cuts can be cooked the same way without affecting the result", "explanation": "Cooking method significantly affects the final texture. Matching method to cut type is essential." },

      "correctExplanation": "Collagen conversion requires sustained low heat. At 220°C, the rapid protein coagulation at the surface outpaces collagen breakdown, resulting in dry, tough meat despite reaching the same internal temperature.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both methods produce identical results because the same total energy is applied to the meat", "explanation": "Total energy is not what matters — the rate of heat application determines whether collagen can convert before proteins over-coagulate." },

      "correctExplanation": "Marinades penetrate only a few millimetres. While acid can denature surface proteins, the collagen throughout the meat can only be converted to gelatin by prolonged slow cooking.",
      "distractors": [

      "correctExplanation": "Pressure cookers raise the boiling point of water, increasing cooking temperature and accelerating collagen conversion. Slow cookers work at lower temperatures but over many hours.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Pressure cookers destroy collagen entirely while slow cookers preserve it intact", "explanation": "Both methods convert collagen to gelatin. The difference is speed: pressure cookers are faster due to higher temperature and pressure." },
