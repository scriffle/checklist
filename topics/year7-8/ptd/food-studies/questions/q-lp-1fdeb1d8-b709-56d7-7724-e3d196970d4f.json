      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because all food products are required to include this warning by law", "explanation": "'May contain' statements are voluntary, not mandatory, under Australian food standards." },

      "distractors": [

        { "answer": "Because small amounts of allergens gradually build up and become toxic", "explanation": "Allergic reactions are immune responses, not toxicity; they can occur immediately from any amount." },

      "distractors": [

      "question": "Why must sulphites above 10mg/kg be declared on Australian food labels?",

      "correctExplanation": "Sulphites are preservatives that can cause serious reactions in people with sulphite sensitivity, particularly those with asthma. Declaration above 10mg/kg protects these individuals.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because sulphites are artificial chemicals that are banned above 10mg/kg", "explanation": "Sulphites are not banned; they are permitted but must be declared above 10mg/kg for safety." },
        { "answer": "Because sulphites change the colour of food and consumers deserve to know", "explanation": "While sulphites can affect colour, the declaration requirement is about health safety, not appearance." },
