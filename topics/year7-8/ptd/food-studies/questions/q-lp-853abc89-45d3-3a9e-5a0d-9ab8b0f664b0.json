      "question": "What happens to the natural sugars when fruit is juiced?",
      "correct": "They become more concentrated",
      "correctExplanation": "When fruit is juiced, the sugars from multiple fruits are concentrated into a single glass, resulting in a higher sugar content per serve than eating one whole fruit.",

      "correct": "Whole fruit requires chewing and contains fibre that slows consumption",

      "correct": "Fibre creates a physical barrier that slows digestion and the release of sugars",

      "distractors": [

      "correct": "Juice is consumed quickly without chewing, and lacks fibre that provides fullness, so you feel hungry sooner",
      "correctExplanation": "Drinking juice takes seconds while eating 3-4 oranges takes much longer. The lack of fibre means less fullness, and the liquid form does not trigger satiety signals as effectively.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Juice contains fewer vitamins than whole fruit so your body feels unsatisfied", "explanation": "Juice retains many vitamins. The reduced satiety is due to lack of fibre and the quick consumption of liquid." },

      "correctExplanation": "Each glass uses 3-4 oranges, so two glasses contain sugar from 6-8 oranges. The guidelines recommend only 2 serves of fruit per day, ideally as whole fruit.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Two glasses perfectly meets the recommended 2 serves of fruit for the day", "explanation": "While it might seem like 2 serves, the sugar content equals 6-8 oranges and lacks the fibre that whole fruit provides." },

      "question": "Why might a person who switches from whole fruit to fruit juice gain weight over time?",
      "correct": "Juice provides concentrated sugar without fibre, leading to higher calorie intake and less fullness",
      "correctExplanation": "Without fibre to slow consumption and provide fullness, a person can consume more sugar from juice than they would from whole fruit, leading to excess energy intake.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Juice causes the body to store more water which appears as weight gain on the scales", "explanation": "Juice does not cause significant water retention. Weight gain comes from excess energy intake due to concentrated sugars." },

      "correct": "While cold-pressing may retain slightly more heat-sensitive nutrients, it still removes fibre and concentrates sugars, so it is not equivalent to whole fruit",
      "correctExplanation": "Cold-pressing may preserve some vitamins better than heat-based extraction, but the fundamental issues remain: fibre is removed and sugars from multiple fruits are concentrated into one serving.",
      "distractors": [

      "correctExplanation": "Eating 3 oranges involves extensive chewing, provides about 6-9g of fibre that expands in the stomach, and takes 15-20 minutes versus seconds for juice. All these factors significantly increase fullness.",
