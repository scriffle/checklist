      "correct": "The claim is incorrect because denaturation is the unfolding of protein structure, while coagulation is the subsequent bonding of those unfolded proteins into a solid — they are two distinct sequential steps",
      "correctExplanation": "Although both occur during cooking, they are different stages: denaturation changes the protein's shape, and coagulation is when those changed proteins bond together.",
      "distractors": [

      "correct": "Low heat for eggs allows gradual, controlled coagulation for a creamy texture, while high heat for chicken strips creates quick surface coagulation to seal in moisture during fast cooking",

      "correctExplanation": "The degree of protein coagulation increases with temperature. Well-done steak has more tightly coagulated proteins that have expelled more moisture.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Well-done steak loses all its protein to the pan juices, leaving only tough fibres behind", "explanation": "Protein remains in the meat. The firmness and dryness come from more extensive coagulation at higher temperatures." },

      "correct": "The textures may differ because the rate of protein coagulation affects the final structure — slower coagulation at lower oven temperature can produce a more tender, evenly cooked result",
      "correctExplanation": "Even at the same final internal temperature, slower cooking allows more gradual coagulation, often resulting in a more tender and juicy texture.",
      "distractors": [
