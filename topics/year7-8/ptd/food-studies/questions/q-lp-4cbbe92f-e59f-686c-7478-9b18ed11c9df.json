      "correct": "To distribute heat evenly and prevent starch granules from clumping together",

    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Why should liquid be added gradually when making a sauce from a roux?",
      "correct": "So each addition is incorporated before more liquid causes clumping",
      "correctExplanation": "Adding liquid slowly allows the starch granules to absorb each addition evenly. Adding all liquid at once causes granules to clump together, creating lumps.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because adding too much liquid at once would make the sauce boil over", "explanation": "Boiling over is a volume issue; the reason for gradual addition is to prevent lumps." },

      "correct": "Because retrogradation happens fastest at refrigerator temperatures around 4°C",

      "correct": "It coats starch granules to prevent them from clumping when liquid is added",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "It provides the main thickening power in the sauce instead of starch", "explanation": "Starch provides the thickening; fat's role is to coat and separate the starch granules." },

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The mixture returns to its original liquid state immediately", "explanation": "Cooling causes gelling, not a return to the original state. Gelatinisation changes are largely maintained." },

      "correctExplanation": "Gelatinisation explains why sauces thicken, bread has structure, pasta changes texture, and custards set. Understanding it is key to controlling texture in many dishes.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because it is the only chemical reaction that occurs during all types of cooking", "explanation": "Many reactions occur during cooking (Maillard, caramelisation, coagulation). Gelatinisation is one of several important processes." },

      "correct": "Gelatinisation creates the soft texture during baking; retrogradation reverses it during storage",
      "correctExplanation": "During baking, starch gelatinises, giving bread its soft, moist texture. During storage, retrogradation reverses this as starch recrystallises, making bread firm and stale.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Both processes occur during baking and neither affects bread during storage", "explanation": "Retrogradation primarily occurs after baking during storage; it's what causes staling." },
        { "answer": "Gelatinisation causes staling while retrogradation creates the soft texture", "explanation": "This is reversed: gelatinisation creates softness and retrogradation causes staling." },

      "question": "Evaluate the counterintuitive finding that bread stales faster in the fridge than at room temperature. How does understanding retrogradation explain this?",
      "correct": "Retrogradation is fastest at 4°C because this temperature optimises starch recrystallisation",
      "correctExplanation": "Starch molecules recrystallise most efficiently at refrigerator temperatures (~4°C). Higher temperatures slow the process, and freezing stops it by immobilising the molecules.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The fridge removes all moisture from bread which causes it to dry out quickly", "explanation": "While fridges can dry food, the primary staling mechanism is retrogradation, not moisture loss." },
        { "answer": "Cold temperatures kill the yeast in bread which is what keeps it fresh", "explanation": "Yeast is killed during baking; it has no role in keeping baked bread fresh." },
        { "answer": "This finding is incorrect because cold temperatures always preserve food better", "explanation": "Cold preserves many foods, but bread is an exception due to retrogradation at fridge temperatures." }

      "correct": "The outer granules gelatinise instantly, forming a coating that traps raw flour inside lumps",
      "correctExplanation": "When dry flour hits hot liquid, the surface granules gelatinise immediately, creating a seal around uncooked flour. This produces lumps with raw flour inside and gel on the outside.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because flour cannot gelatinise without fat being present in the mixture", "explanation": "Flour can gelatinise in water alone; a roux uses fat to prevent clumping, not to enable gelatinisation." },
        { "answer": "Because flour dissolves in cold water but not in hot water at any temperature", "explanation": "Flour doesn't truly dissolve; it suspends and gelatinises. The issue is clumping, not dissolving." },
        { "answer": "Because hot liquid destroys the starch in flour before it can thicken", "explanation": "Heat doesn't destroy starch; it enables gelatinisation. The issue is how the flour is introduced." }

      "correct": "A roux coats starch in fat before adding liquid; a slurry suspends starch in cold liquid first",
      "correctExplanation": "Both prevent clumping but differently: a roux uses fat to separate granules before liquid is added. A slurry uses cold liquid to suspend granules before adding to hot liquid.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "A roux uses wheat starch while a slurry uses a completely different substance", "explanation": "Both use starch that gelatinises; the difference is in how clumping is prevented, not the starch type." },

      "correctExplanation": "Knowing the temperature stages explains thin sauces (not hot enough), lumpy sauces (liquid added too fast), and staling (retrogradation). This knowledge enables targeted fixes.",

        { "answer": "Only the bursting temperature of 96°C matters and the other stages are irrelevant", "explanation": "All stages matter: absorption at 60°C, swelling at 85°C, bursting at 96°C, and gelling on cooling." }

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "This is accurate because all starches are chemically identical molecules", "explanation": "While all starches are polysaccharides, their granule structure varies, producing different cooking properties." },
        { "answer": "This is accurate because gelatinisation always occurs at exactly 96°C for all starches", "explanation": "96°C is approximate and varies between starch types; some gelatinise at lower temperatures." },
        { "answer": "This is inaccurate because only wheat starch can undergo gelatinisation properly", "explanation": "All starches can gelatinise; they just do so at slightly different temperatures and with different results." }

      "correctExplanation": "Heat temporarily reverses retrogradation, but once the bread cools, recrystallisation resumes. This is a short-term fix, not a permanent solution.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Toasting has no effect on stale bread and is completely useless as a solution", "explanation": "Toasting does temporarily improve stale bread by reversing retrogradation; it's just not permanent." },
