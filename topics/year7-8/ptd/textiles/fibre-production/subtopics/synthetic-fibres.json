  "icon": "🏭",
  "what": "This subtopic covers how synthetic fibres are manufactured from petroleum, including polyester, nylon, and acrylic. You will also learn about semi-synthetic fibres like rayon and lyocell, which start from natural materials but undergo chemical processing.",
  "why": "Synthetic fibres now dominate global textile production, with polyester alone accounting for 57% of all fibres. Understanding their manufacture, properties, and environmental impacts is essential for informed textile choices.",

      "title": "I can explain how synthetic fibres are manufactured using spinnerets",
      "code": "4.1",
      "what": "Synthetic fibre production involves polymerisation (creating long-chain molecules from petroleum chemicals), melting or dissolving the polymer, extruding through a spinneret (metal plate with tiny 0.05-0.1mm holes), solidification, and drawing (stretching to align molecules).",
      "why": "Understanding the manufacturing process explains why synthetic fibres have consistent properties, why they are derived from non-renewable petroleum, and how their properties can be precisely controlled.",
      "example": "The spinneret works like a showerhead with microscopic holes. Round holes create standard fibres, triangular holes create fibres with enhanced lustre, and hollow centres create fibres with better insulation. Polyester fibres are stretched up to 5 times their original length during drawing.",

      "title": "I can describe polyester's properties, advantages, and environmental concerns",
      "code": "4.2",
      "what": "Polyester (PET) is the world's most used fibre at 57% of global production. It has very low moisture absorption (0.4-1%), is wrinkle-resistant, strong, and quick-drying. However, it is made from petroleum, takes 20-200 years to decompose, and releases microplastic fibres when washed.",
      "why": "Understanding polyester's dominance and trade-offs helps evaluate textile choices between performance benefits and environmental costs.",
      "example": "Polyester is produced using melt spinning at 260-270°C. Recycled polyester (rPET) from plastic bottles uses 59-79% less energy than virgin polyester. However, recycled polyester may release more microplastic fibres during washing than virgin polyester because the recycled fibres are often shorter and weaker.",

      "title": "I can explain nylon's historical significance and key properties",
      "code": "4.3",
      "what": "Nylon was the first fully synthetic fibre, invented on February 28, 1935. It is extremely strong (stronger than steel of the same diameter), has excellent elasticity and abrasion resistance, is lightweight and quick-drying, but takes 30-40 years to decompose.",
      "why": "Nylon's invention revolutionised textiles and demonstrates how synthetic fibres can provide properties impossible in natural materials.",
      "example": "When nylon stockings went on sale in 1940, stores sold out within hours and nylon riots occurred. Nylon's strength and elasticity make it ideal for hosiery, activewear, swimwear, parachutes, ropes, fishing nets, and carpet fibres.",

      "title": "I can identify why acrylic is particularly problematic for microplastic pollution",
      "code": "4.4",
      "what": "Acrylic (containing at least 85% acrylonitrile) releases approximately 730,000 microplastic fibres per wash—about 5 times more than polyester-cotton blends. These tiny particles pass through washing machine filters and water treatment plants into waterways and oceans.",
      "why": "Understanding acrylic's microplastic contribution highlights how different synthetic fibres have different environmental impacts, informing purchasing and care decisions.",
      "example": "Synthetic textiles contribute 35% of ocean microplastics. A single wash can release 640,000-1,500,000 microfibres. Microplastics have been found in marine life, drinking water, food, and human blood. Acrylic takes approximately 200 years to decompose.",

      "title": "I can distinguish between traditional viscose/rayon and lyocell production methods",
      "code": "4.5",
      "what": "Traditional viscose treats wood pulp with toxic chemicals including 17.5% sodium hydroxide and carbon disulfide, creating pollution. Lyocell (TENCEL) uses a closed-loop process with non-toxic NMMO solvent, recovering 99.8% for reuse with much less water and energy.",
      "why": "Semi-synthetic fibres show that natural source materials do not automatically mean sustainable production. Understanding the difference helps evaluate environmental claims.",
      "example": "Viscose was developed in the late 1800s as a cheaper silk alternative. Carbon disulfide is hazardous to workers and the environment. Lyocell biodegrades in approximately 55 days and is stronger than cotton when wet. Both start from wood pulp but have very different environmental impacts.",

      "title": "I can compare decomposition times of different synthetic and semi-synthetic fibres",
      "code": "4.6",
      "what": "Decomposition times vary significantly: lyocell takes about 55 days, nylon 30-40 years, polyester 20-200 years, and acrylic approximately 200 years. These times mean synthetic textiles can persist in landfill for generations.",
      "why": "Understanding end-of-life impacts is crucial for evaluating the full environmental footprint of textile choices.",
      "example": "The fashion industry produces about 92 million tonnes of textile waste globally each year. Compare these to natural fibres: linen decomposes in 2 weeks to a few months, cotton in 1 week to 5 months, and wool in 1-5 years depending on conditions.",
