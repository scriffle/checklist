      "question": "Why do staple fibres need to be spun before they can be used as yarn?",
      "correct": "Because they are too short to use individually and spinning twists them into a continuous strand",
      "correctExplanation": "Staple fibres are only a few centimetres to 50cm long. Spinning twists many short fibres together to create a continuous, strong yarn.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Because spinning adds chemical coatings that make the fibres waterproof", "explanation": "Spinning is a physical twisting process, not a chemical treatment. It joins short fibres into continuous yarn." },

      "correct": "Staple fibres produce yarn with a softer, fuzzier texture while filaments create smoother, shinier yarn",

      "correct": "Cotton grows as short staple fibres while polyester is manufactured as continuous filaments",
      "correctExplanation": "Cotton fibres grow in short lengths from seed bolls, requiring spinning. Polyester is extruded through spinnerets as continuous filament strands.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "Cotton is weaker than polyester so it breaks into short pieces easily", "explanation": "Cotton's short length is natural, not due to breaking. Cotton grows as short fibres attached to seeds." },

        { "answer": "Cotton cannot be made into filaments due to its brown natural colour", "explanation": "Colour has nothing to do with fibre length. Cotton is naturally short because of how it grows on the plant." }

      "distractors": [

      "distractors": [

      "correct": "Silk's continuous filament creates a naturally smooth, lustrous fabric that is difficult and labour-intensive to produce",

      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "There are no trade-offs because cut staple yarn retains all filament properties", "explanation": "Cutting changes the yarn's characteristics. Staple yarn loses the smoothness and lustre of filament yarn." },

      "correctExplanation": "Cutting polyester to staple length mimics cotton's texture but does not change polyester's low absorbency, poor breathability, and non-biodegradable nature.",
      "distractors": [
