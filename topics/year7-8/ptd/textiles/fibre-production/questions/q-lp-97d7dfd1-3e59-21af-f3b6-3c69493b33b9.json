      "correct": "The more-than-double difference means wool provides a much larger safety margin before ignition occurs in real-world fire scenarios",
      "correctExplanation": "Cotton can ignite from relatively modest heat sources at 255°C, while wool resists ignition at temperatures over twice as high, dramatically improving safety margins.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "The difference is too small to have any practical significance for safety standards", "explanation": "A 315-345°C difference is enormous and directly affects whether a fabric ignites from common heat sources." },
