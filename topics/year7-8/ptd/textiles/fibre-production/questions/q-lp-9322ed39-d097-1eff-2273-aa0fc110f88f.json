      "correctExplanation": "Property information would enable informed choices, but technical data needs clear presentation to be accessible to non-specialist consumers.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "No, because consumers are incapable of understanding any technical fibre information", "explanation": "Consumers regularly process technical information for electronics and food. Clear presentation makes fibre data accessible." },

      "distractors": [
