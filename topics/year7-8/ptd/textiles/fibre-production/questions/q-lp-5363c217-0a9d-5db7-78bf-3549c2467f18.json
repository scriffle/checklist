    {"type":"mc","question":"A linen producer notices their retted flax fibres are breaking easily. Based on your knowledge of retting, what likely went wrong?","correct":"The flax was over-retted, allowing bacteria to damage the fibres themselves","correctExplanation":"When retting continues too long, bacteria begin decomposing the linen fibres after consuming all the pectin.","distractors":[{"answer":"The flax was not retted long enough, leaving the fibres too thick and rigid","explanation":"Under-retting would leave fibres stuck to stems; easy breaking indicates over-retting damage."},{"answer":"The flax was grown in the wrong climate causing permanent fibre weakness","explanation":"Climate affects growth, but fibre breakage after retting specifically indicates over-retting damage."},{"answer":"The flax stalks were harvested too early before fibres had fully developed inside","explanation":"Harvest timing affects yield, but post-retting breakage specifically indicates over-retting."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"A textile manufacturer wants to start linen production. Why would they need to carefully monitor the retting process rather than simply leaving it for a fixed time?","correct":"Environmental conditions affect retting speed, so the same duration may over-ret or under-ret depending on conditions","correctExplanation":"Temperature, humidity, and bacterial activity vary, meaning retting progress must be checked rather than timed to a fixed schedule.","distractors":[{"answer":"Retting always takes exactly the same time regardless of any environmental conditions","explanation":"Retting speed varies with temperature, moisture, and bacterial conditions; monitoring is essential."},{"answer":"Fixed timing works perfectly because bacteria decompose pectin at a constant predictable rate","explanation":"Bacterial activity varies with conditions; retting requires active monitoring, not fixed timing."},{"answer":"Monitoring is unnecessary because under-retting and over-retting produce the same quality result","explanation":"Under-retting prevents separation and over-retting damages fibres; outcomes are very different."}]},
    {"type":"mc","question":"Compare the production complexity of cotton (ginning) versus linen (retting, scutching, hackling). How does this explain price differences?","correct":"Linen requires multiple labour-intensive steps while cotton ginning is a single mechanical process","correctExplanation":"Cotton ginning is quick and mechanised; linen needs weeks of retting plus scutching and hackling, adding cost.","distractors":[{"answer":"Cotton and linen require identical processing steps and should cost the same to produce","explanation":"The processes are very different; linen requires weeks of retting plus additional mechanical steps."},{"answer":"Linen is simpler to process because retting is automatic while cotton ginning needs supervision","explanation":"Retting requires careful monitoring; cotton ginning is more mechanised and automated."},{"answer":"Cotton is more expensive to process but sold cheaper due to agricultural surplus production","explanation":"Cotton processing is genuinely simpler and cheaper; linen's multiple steps increase production costs."}]},
