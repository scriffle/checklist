      "correctExplanation": "The cotton boll is mostly seed by weight. The lint surrounding the seeds is the smaller component, making cotton processing relatively low-yield.",
      "distractors": [

      "correct": "After flowering, the boll develops containing seeds surrounded by cotton fibres that will become textile material",

      "distractors": [

      "correct": "The low lint percentage is a characteristic of the plant, but cottonseed by-products add value so the total resource use is efficient",
      "correctExplanation": "While lint yield seems low, the whole boll is used: lint for textiles, seed for oil and feed, minimising waste from the agricultural resource.",
      "distractors": [
        { "answer": "35-42% recovery proves cotton is wasteful and should be replaced entirely by synthetics", "explanation": "The whole boll is utilised. Cottonseed products make the total system efficient despite moderate lint yield." },

        { "answer": "Lint recovery rates are irrelevant because all of the cotton boll becomes textile fibre", "explanation": "Only 35-42% becomes lint. The rest is seed and waste, though seed has its own commercial value." }
