      "title": "I can explain what Country means to Aboriginal peoples",
      "code": "3.1",
      "what": "Country is more than just a place on a map. It includes all the values, places, resources, stories and cultural obligations associated with an area. Aboriginal peoples see themselves as deeply connected to Country.",
      "why": "Understanding Country helps explain why land is so important to Aboriginal peoples and why they have maintained connections to specific places for tens of thousands of years.",
      "example": "Professor Mick Dodson explains that Country describes 'the entirety of our ancestral domains' including homeland, resources, stories and cultural obligations, not just land ownership.",

      "title": "I can describe what The Dreaming is and why it is important",
      "code": "3.2",
      "what": "The Dreaming is the collection of religious beliefs and cultural practices of Aboriginal peoples. It establishes the structures of society, rules for social behaviour, kinship relationships and how people should treat the land.",
      "why": "The Dreaming contains the rules for living and has been passed down through generations, connecting modern Aboriginal peoples to their ancient ancestors.",
      "example": "Teaching stories like Tiddalik teach children how to behave and treat the land. Tiddalik teaches that water must be conserved. Children learn their responsibilities according to The Dreaming from a very young age.",

      "title": "I can explain what Ailan Kastom means for Torres Strait Islander peoples",
      "code": "3.3",
      "what": "Ailan Kastom (meaning 'island custom') refers to the unique cultures of the peoples of the Torres Strait. It is a source of unity and strength that bonds Torres Strait Islander peoples whether living on the islands or mainland Australia.",
      "why": "Ailan Kastom maintains cultural identity and connection for Torres Strait Islander peoples across different locations, preserving traditions through generations.",
      "example": "Torres Strait Islander peoples tell traditional stories about the past, present and future through spoken word, music, song and dance. The Story of Gelam describes how the three Murray Islands were formed by Gelam, a mythical ancestor who travelled as a dugong.",

      "title": "I can describe how oral histories preserve knowledge across generations",
      "code": "3.4",
      "what": "Oral histories pass information from one generation to the next through spoken word, song or dance. They give important insights into ancient beliefs and have been validated by scientific evidence.",
      "why": "Oral histories have preserved accurate information about events for thousands of years, demonstrating the reliability of this tradition for maintaining cultural knowledge.",
      "example": "Researchers analysed 21 oral histories covering 18,000 to 7,000 years ago and found remarkable consistency about rising sea levels. The Kulin Nation's stories describe how kangaroo hunting grounds were slowly lost to the sea.",

      "code": "3.5",
      "what": "Different Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have unique creation stories. The Kulin peoples believe Bunjil, the great eagle spirit, created the world. Other groups have stories about the Rainbow Serpent or Baiame the sky father.",
      "why": "Different creation stories remind us how diverse the beliefs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are across Australia, while still sharing common elements.",
      "example": "The only known Aboriginal rock art depiction of Bunjil is found in a cave at the Bunjil Shelter in Grampians National Park. The Story of Gelam describes how Gelam created the Murray Islands and brought yam, coconut and other plants.",
